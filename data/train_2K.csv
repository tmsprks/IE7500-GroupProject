1,not factual,"The book seems bent on giving information that is not factual and twists the messages around to make them seem inconsistent with church teaching. When doing research on the actual messages in Medjugorje, they are consistent with Church teaching. The official ruling of the church states that Medjugorje is a Holy place and a Shrine. That should be good enough for anyone. Since the church has been studying Medjugorje and the messages, if there were anything wrong with the messages, it would have been condemned a long time ago as was bayside."
1,2 original followed by a fake using subscribe and save,"This product is great IF YOU GET THE ORIGINAL.I subscribed for it and got the first 2 deliveries perfectly fine. But, the most recent one I received is just not the original product. It stinks as if diluted with some cheap nail polish remover and the viscosity is like water.Till now I rated Amazon very high, but with this episode I am feeling so cheated that now I will think twice before ordering anything; and any new subscription is a definitely no."
1,poor clamp,"I love Bessy clamps, but am disappointed in the DuoKlamps. I had to return 2 300x65 clamps because they slip when putting clamping pressure on them. I now have a problem with a 300x85 clamp that slips and doesn't clamp any longer. My other Dupklamps have problems in that the reversing switch sometimes disengages and needs to be reset.I think Bessy has a design or manufacturing problem with these clamps. Does Bessy have a recall on these clamps? If not, they should.Marty"
1,Ordered this HD-DVD..NOT FORMATTED PROPERLY!,I ordered this HD-DVD but it would not work in my HD Sony Entertainment System! I contacted the company and told them and they advised my to send it back and they would send my a regular DVD. I explained that I did have an HD system but it must not have been formatted correctly. I decided not to send it back because it would cost me over $5.00 in postage and I only paid $4.50 for the DVD. I did not want to invest more than I paid for the DVD. I purchased the DVD elsewhere. I would not purchase from this vendor again!
1,Tom Cats fizzles..,"i'm a huge R.O. fan, but this cd fizzles bigtime. this is somewhat of an exploration into techno, and is nearly absent of the brilliant songwriting we have come to know and love. i think he self titled this CD because it is clearly different from his work as TFF. i could not reccomend this disc to even the most avid fan."
1,Atrocious.,"This book if you could call it that is a joke, its one long advertisement for the authors ""NaNoWriMo"" competition, don't expect to learn how to write a novel from this book. All the advice you get can be summed up into this list; drink lots of coffee, eat a ton of junk food, and brag about how you're writing a novel. No I'm not joking. Stay away from this piece of trash and pick up Scott bells plot and structure and Donald Maass writing the breakout novel. That is assuming you want to write a decent novel and not type random gibberish into your word processor when you can't think of anything, simply to up your word count, yet again no I'm not joking that's in the book too."
1,Okay,"It was a good story and well written but I was disappointed because I wanted to read more about Aubrey and Jessica and Risika and Fala and Caryn and all of the old characters. But it was a really good book, I was just wanting to read about the old characters. It wasn't what I was expecting... I don't know... It was okay I guess. It took me awhile to finish it though. But if you're a fan you might as well read it."
1,Clint Estwood should not sing in a musical ever,"Bad story line, bad lyrics and clint estwood's bad sounding voice just does not come to a good mix.This movie is not even worth being for free.Thankfully I have watched this using the primevideo of Amazon so that I now know not to ever include this in my video libraries of the future -- some things are ok to allow to fade into historic bliss."
1,It's alright,"I wasn't terribly into Brand New before Deja Entendu came out, although I did like Taking Back Sunday, and I always saw them grouped in the same category. However, listening to their first album, all I heard was a mediocre band who played your typical emo-punk music. It's nice that they've tried something new with Deja Entendu, but yet again, all I hear is a mediocre band, this time ""maturing."" Even though the album has some decent tracks and an experimental edge, the way in which they've ""matured"" is far too predictible (a young punk band going artsy), and they appear to be trying all too hard to change their style. I do however enjoy their unique vocal approach and I like the fact that they put some thought into the album, although trying a bit too hard. Overall, it's a mediocre album, but not entirely worthless or unlistenable."
1,Trance presets,"I have a Virus, I think this guy is just using the presets and singing over top of them. In any case, this is essentially Trance music w/ goth vocals on top. Clever."
1,Lion King 1 1/2,The Lion King 1 1/2We paid the high price for this movie to make sure we received a new copy. However when we recieved the movie the 1st DVD has breaks/skips in it and the 2nd DVD would not play at all. We sent an email to see about returning the DVD but was informed that the company we purchased the DVD from was no longer taking emails. However the company still has these movies listed for sale on Amazon.com. Buyers be ware because the (new) movie we ordered and paid for is not watchable.
1,Probably not good for you!,"They actually included uranium ore in the Gilbert chemistry set I got for X-mas in the mid-'50â€™s. Plus - a sealed magnifying eye-piece into which we junior scientists could peer to see ""the atomic disintegration of radium."" Being junior scientists, we naturally tore apart the eyepiece to see what the radium looked like. Then we went outside to run through the DDT fog behind the mosquito sprayers. Mom said it ""probably wasn't good for us."""
1,Judas Iscariot,I we were living in the days ofJesus and Judas iscariot write a book; critizes Jesus you will by it?
1,ehhh whatever,this is a whatever movie i bought it cause it had good reviews but i just found it kind of boring i think it def needed a better cast
1,There is no such thing,It is possible but to everyone like me who has a million things to do it is nearly impossible. But it was free and free is always good.
1,Not the most accurate thermometer,FYI...my baby was delivered at 35 weeks causing a stay in the neonatal icu. I was considering purchasing this thermometer before our arrival until I asked a couple of nurses if it was better than the under the arm thermometer that they use. they use the under the arm because it is the most accurate reading. The ear readings can be very inconsistent according to different factors such as which ear they use and position of the ear and lack of steady contact. I will be using the under the arm when my girl gets home. just wanted to pass the info along.
1,Not typical of Brian setzer,"This is NOT typical swinging Setzer, for intead of swaggering horns and hot guitar solos, you get hip hip, rap and techno mixed with otherwise good music. Too bad Setzer's producers made him make this such a commerical release, go for The Dirty boogie instead."
1,Sing it don't write it!,"Don't get me wrong, I love Johnny Cash's music, especially that album where he helped all those prisoners - many of them murderers - escape from the Hell of their daily routines. But this is yet another book that proves the old adage that musicians should stick to music and leave writing to the writers and autobiographing to the autobiographers. It's an interesting story, but Johnny's already told that story much better through his songs and stage shows."
1,The Art of Aging,"A friend recommended the book, but I started to read it and it was not interesting enough....never got past page 5....dry, without graphics. Perhaps to cerebral."
1,Poorest customer service from Poloroid,"I have bought this DVD player in April 2004 and it wasn't playing right from the next day. I figured out that the tray wasn't closing right, so I had fixed the problem myself. Then the remote stopped working. I have replaced the battery, but still didn't help. So, I contacted the customer service and they informed me that a replacement will be sent to me in couple of day. One week, no response at all. I contacted three times and never had a response and they keep telling me it will be sent on priority. They have never sent the remote replacement even after 5 months.I WILL NEVER BUY POLAROID products. DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM THEM."
1,worthless item... waste of money!,Sounds like a great idea. It came with the bathtub we bought. The water flow is like a trickle and even for that you have to apply very hard constant pressure. Now it uses 4 batteries... Iam not sure what they are doing there?I wish I could return the whole thing but I had already been using the tub for a couple of months before my baby got big enough to use the shower. So i am stuck with something I didn't use at all.
1,Buy some cotton balls instead.,"I bought these specifically for noise cancellation. The reviews I read said they were superior to the $300 Bose that everyone sees advertised. A sad statement, if true. THEY ABSOLUTELY SUCK as noise attentuators. I test drove them in front of a TV with moderate volume. Spend 25 cents on a box of cotton balls and you will be better rewarded. As a 30 year electrical engineer I am amazed someone had the audacity to sell these as noise canceling headphones- they aren't even adequate as static earmuffs. If there was a negative star rating I would have selected it for this review. ABSOLUTE WASTE OF MONEY."
1,THE WORST ALBUM KMFDM HAVE EVER DONE,"I love KMFDM they are one of my favourite bands, but this has only 3 good songs ""No meat-No man"", Don't blow your top"" and ""Disgust"". The rest is all instrumental and BAD at that.AVOID and buy NIHIL and ANGST as they KICK..."
1,Not as strong as other products,I've striped wood finishes before with OTHER products and had no problems other than the fumes are strong. Citri-Strip smells fine but takes repeated applications letting it sit for 15 hours at a pop to get it to loosen the poly finish I'm trying to strip. In the future I'll wait until the spring/summer for my stripping projects and get a decent product.
1,expected more!,"The film has action and violence, (very japanese style), but the story goes from good to weird, i really expected more, yet is good for japanese movies fans"
1,A slight disappointment,"I like the author's writing style, and this was a decent solid 3-3.5 story until chapter 17, then the story plunged to a 2 as I felt the scenario was too unbelievable and it turned some decent characters into not-so-nice characters. The story did keep a good pace and pulled itself back to a solid 3-3.5 until the very end -- where *unrevealed spoiler* takes place and is followed by an abrupt ""the end"". The writing style is good enough, I'll consider reading another story from this author."
1,Christ on a cracker!,"Oh sweet jesus. This book is, possibly, the worst ever written. Just don't read it okay? It's not even ""so bad it's funny."" It's just...bad."
1,I don't get all the hype,"The first scene they hunt this wild pig, kill it, then they cut the testacles off it and make one of the guys eat them in hopes that he will be able to get his wife pregnant. They actually showed him eating the balls...gross. I promptly removed it from the PS3, put it in the Netflix envelope and sent it back. It is beyond me why you'd open a movie like that."
1,Worthless!,"This is a worthless device! It doesn't cut or shave! It imperils the areas you want to trim! I have continued to try using it, hoping that I could find a technique that would work, but to no avail. It skips over half the areas, and catches and cuts if you aren't entirely focused. It's safer and easier to use a razor!"
1,A let down for a trilogy that started with promise,"Philip Pullman completes his ""Dark Materials"" series, and, sadly, there are few surprises. This last book ends as a preachy muddle, and most of the promised climaxes turn out to be anti-climaxes (the foreshadowed betrayal, the end of the Authority, etc.) As radical as Pullman fancies himself, this work also seems to keep trying to reconcile its anti-Christian impulses with Christian morality (dying to self for others, the value of truth, the gifts of the body and physicality). Pullman fashions a straw man of Christianity that actually much more resembles various Christian heresies such as Manichaeism or gnosticism, all the while espousing some of their tenets. For someone who has vocally criticised C. S. Lewis for a tendency to sermonize, Pullman surprising falls to the same temptation, blunting his craftsmanship in this final book of the trilogy."
1,generic,"I read it and can't remember if I decided to keep it on my shelf. I guess that's never good. The examples read like a reader's digest soap opera and are painfully generic, and painful to read! Other than that, I read it a week ago and already forgot if it was helpful. I think it had basic advice that was helpful for couples, as I recall, but the writing style was painful."
1,Waste of time,"'Total crap', that's the summary of this review. I've expected a lot more from a Jungian psychologist. After good start and some reasonable examples the writer just keeps on explaining why the given examples are cases of synchronicity. The writer drivels on and on, eventually arriving nowhere... Like the other reviewer wrote: what's the point he's trying to make?If you're looking for an answer on how to recognize and make use of synchronicity, this is not the book, reading it will be a waste of time."
1,Very disappointed,My daughter received this for Christmas. I was thrilled she got it until she began to play with it. The pegs are WAY TO SHORT and do not stay in. It is a disgrace they have allowed this to stay on the market....don't waste your hard earned $$$
1,GAY!,"This is the gayest Eminem song I've ever heard. This is terrible. With this song, Eminem tries to make d12 seem like a rap version of The backstreet Boys. people call Eminem homophobic becuase he's used the word ""F@&&0T"" in his music a few times. This song proves that he isn't. It is so gay don't buy this"
1,Waterpik Model WP-360W,This item carries too little water to do a good job. Other wise it is of good quality.
1,Dissapointed in the short life-span,"This grinder is smallish, quiet, and grinds evenly... for a while. After about a year (during which it has been cleaned regularly), it stopped taking beans into the grind mechanism - resulting in an uneven amount of ground coffee. In addition, it is also very messy - grounds get all over the place around the grinder while it is working, worse than other grinders I've used. Very frustrating... definitely not worth the price."
1,What a shame!,"This dvd has a lot of wrong information. First, on its cover there is an information that it has Luciano and Culture performances, however, when you play the dvd you don't see any Luciano and Culture's performances. Besides that on its cover it says that it has 3hrs of running time, but in fact, it has only 50 minutes. The Chaka Demus'perfomance was too short. The Great Gregory Isaacs sings only 2 songs. The only good thing about this dvd is the Morgan Heritage performance.If you are waiting to watch a great dvd, don't buy it. Save your money."
1,Junk. Avoid this. It does not work.,Unable to repair the simplest scratch for repair. Bad cleaning job. Repaired nothing. Avoid this.
1,Worst Racing Game Ever!,"Not only is this game severely limited and restricted in terms of gameplay but the huge clumsly trucks are hardly the best kind of vehicles to be racing in.King Of Route 66 is one of the most linear, non-interactive games I have ever played. The racing locations are lifeless, the trucks are cumbersome and hard to control, you only get to choose between 3 different trucks to begin with, there's way too much repetition and zero excitement.Racing games, by their very nature, are kind of limited in what is possible but this is the worst. Get GTA: Vice City and play that. It's everything a game about cars/trucks/vehicles of any kind should be. Leave this drek alone."
1,This is so sad . . .,"This ISN'T Joseph. I am his oldest daughter.If this is what music is coming to . . . then i need to make a record label . . . and get some REAL SINGERS ON IT! People, Teairra Mari has an average voice. But she sounds just like Rihanna, Ciara, Brooke Valentine, and Ashanti, who also have AVERAGE VOICES. I wish that the Music Industry would produce some REAL talent and not give someone a record deal beacuse they THINK that the person is pretty. And for the person who said Teairra Mari is 12, she's 17 (duh). And in reference to another review, I actually think that JoJo is better than Teairra Mari when it comes to vocals, but back to the point.This CD is a piece of garbage. The only songs worth listening to are ""Make Her Feel Good"" (basically for the beat and she uses the ""N"" word too much) and ""No Daddy"" (and that's only for the beat, the lyrics are stupid.)DO NOT BUY THIS CD. DOWNLOAD THE FIRST TWO SONGS ON YOUR IPOD/ MIX CD."
1,Send back Antonio to Spain and Lucie to China!,"Just the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. The whole plot is not even funny is just lousy. I think I could do a better job filming a dark, heavy metal soundtrack, jumping and shooting rubber bullets with my 2 year old daughter than this! Please, if you are even thinking of buying this DVD, spare the money with someone who really needs it!"
1,INDIFFERENT RECORDINGS OF LIMP PERFORMANCES,"The recordings are the opposite of vivid, and the performances are nothing special.Save your money for Lipatti in the Waltzes and Rubinstein in the Polonaises."
1,Unbearably annoying despite some good ideas & insights,"I'm sorry, but Thomas Friedman is *extremely* annoying. This book made me curse my habitual inability to not finish reading a book once I've started it.There are definitely quality insights and some good ideas - notably the one that reviewer Robert Steele pointed out earlier, about how Bush should have made energy independence his ""moon shot"" - *would've* been brilliant.A previous reviewer notes Friedman's apparently plentiful factual errors, but part of me just doesn't even care if he's right or not because his tone the whole time is so obnoxiously glib. He comes off like the sort of creepy fast-talking know-it-all that you know you can't trust even when you don't know why. I hate to just hurl insults, but my honest impression is that he's basically a mind flatterer for readers (particularly American ones), a corporate apologist, and a CEO groupie."
1,Not good for light user.,"Although the basic functions of the printer is not so bad for personal use, if you print substantial amount of paper for work or study, you should choose another one. The price of the machine itself appear to be reasonable, yes, is reasonable, however, ink is very expensive. I regret to realize this HP's scheme of business after buying one. And, it does not work well when you try to print both side of paper.I will never ""buy American""."
1,Brutally aweful,"The Hammer Lane is the relaunch that ruined the Ghost Rider series for years. The story lacks any depth, is just stupid and hard to follow. The art is painful to look at. I thought that perhaps this Ghost Rider series was meant to appeal to 7 year olds but when I showed it to my nephew he laughed and tore the comic to shreds.Thankfully, the most recent relaunch of Ghost Rider by Garth Ennis features the Ghost Rider as Hell's bounty hunter with more of a gritty, serious story line and excellent art. This is a story and art much more deserving of this aewsome yet underdeveloped Marvel icon."
1,Left something to be desired,"This book was a light read. The authors had a really good story line going and the plot had real potential. I liked the characters and was very interested in their conflict, however towards the end the story seemed rushed. The authors took a lot of time setting everything up and introducing us to the characters. The story leading up to the climax was very well written and kept me wondering what was going to happen next, but it disappointed me. It just seemed like they spent all this time on the book and then got tired of it so they finished it off real quick. It was, however, an ejoyable read.-indifferent"
1,Very bad mastering!,"This DVD has the worst mastering I have ever seen.While still images are often exquisitely detailed,moving objects detach from their backgrounds andwallpaper patterns dance. Such compression artefactsare extremely distracting and made watching thisDVD a frustrating and disappointing experience."
1,Not much Chan in this one!,"I didn't care that much for this film--I checked it out to seea Jackie Chan movie, but he's not really in this one that much,although the two longer scenes he is in are good ones, and generally the fight scenes are pretty entertaining. However, the humor in this one seemed moronic to me, and there was SOOOO much of it! But if you really like Sammo Hung and his sense of humor, you'll love it."
1,Was this a high school project?,So the subject is far fringe..get that. I even get the whole Harry Potter wizard rock thing. What I don't get is fifteen minutes of footage of trees.....
1,Lousy Packaging,"This review is for the album packaging, not the music. Cheap coarse paper sleeves had the records all marred and scratched before I even took them out of the sleeves. Garbage."
1,"Good author, not some of his best work","I don't know, I thought this seemed like a great idea. And maybe in some markets it is. In Philadelphia, it's different from the authors home of Florida and I just didn't get anything out of reading this book. When he says options are a little known used RE tool, he ain't lying! After reading Mr. Lucier's book I realized that this was a concept that was completely impractical for me. Some of his stories about finding warehouses that sat vacant for years, cleaning the floor and a coat of pain and voila! $25000 profit, well, they just seem totally out there to me. If you think you can make a go of it, yes, it takes little money but this concept is seldom used and not going to work in many places."
1,rent it before you buy it,"I am an intelligent person who enjoys good period pieces, but this was not at all a good movie. I think part of the problem was that it was adapted from a play, and I prefer films that develop character like in novels. It was very slow and completely devoid of character development. Explanations of the characters' motivations were practically nonexistent and seemed rather arbitrary.While highly literary people might like this movie, I think anyone who enjoys a real story should avoid it. To be fair, though, the acting was good; my problem with the movie is entirely due to the material. If in doubt, rent it first to make sure you want to own it. Also don't buy it just for the alleged sex scene; you don't see anything exciting, and it made me cringe because it was essentially rape."
1,pot calls kettle.........,What I find interesting here is the use of linguistic subterfuge in accusing Chomsky of linguistic subterfuge. If one chooses to read beyond the smoke and mirrors here one will be disappointed to find little else.
1,Buzzards are Circling,"Boy oh boy! I finally got to see what all the fuss is about. Now that I've read this book, I can only say, ""What was all the fuss about?"" Its a pitiful attempt at a first, hopefully last, novel. It seemed to me that the author was focused on smearing people instead of crafting a story. Very poorly put together book, vocabulary that is laughable, not ""real"". It appears the author was so anxious to see his book in print that he forgot that all-important editing step."
1,Way overpriced!!!,Ridiculously overpriced for how mini they are... could have bought a bag of these at Target for less than $10.
1,Big disappointment,This is not a Disco Collection. Only a few of the numbes are and the rest is amature at best
1,Poor Editing,Anyone who enjoys Stephen Ambrose would be well advised to skip this book. It suffers from terrible editing that produced a very repetive narrative with numerous and inexplicable errors.
1,IOGear MiniView PS/2 KVM Switch,"The unit was easy to install but several keyboards wouldn't sync with the unit. With certain programs, one of the computers keyboards would not work properly. Tried several PS/2 keyboards and had problems with them all. System was running Windows XP Pro on both computers. exchanged unit for a Trendnet uSB KVM switch from Amazon and all the problems went away."
1,Bought THREE to get ONE that worked!! Poor quality control!!,"At 10pm on Christmas Eve when we got the vanity put together, we inserted the key. The light flashed, Cinderella appeared, but NO sound. We took apart the mirror and reattached it, and never got Cinderella to appear again OR any sound. My best friend bought one for her daughter and had problems getting Cinderella to appear as well. We went to three different stores (first two were sold out) the day after Christmas to get a replacement (thank you K-mart). FINALLY we found one that worked. Of course, our 4-year-old loves it now that it works, but it is RIDICULOUS that Disney would put out a toy that has a 50%+ failure rate. What a disappointment!!"
1,High-End Only,"Due to my love of both bioware and obsidian games I was greatly anticipating this game and bought a new computer to play it (although I will admit a relatively low end new system). The system specs were well above the recomendeded and despite this the game runs incredably poorly. Were not talking a little bit, were talking jumping animations, poor movement, and graphics far below NWN1 to make it playable. I don't know exactly how they managed to pull this off, but its impressive. If you have a top end gaming system I suspect this game would be rather amazing, but with anything beneath that it is sadly a waste of cash."
1,GREAT PRODUCT DISHONEST RETAILER,"Item was listed as being in stock but it took them 8 days to fill the order and 4 to get to me. Either AmericaRX was lying about in-stock, or they could not care less about their customers.Do yourself a favor, pay the extra few cents and do not order from AmericaRX.I have ordered many things through Amazon without problems, AmericaRX is one that will not again get my business."
1,Real Ghost Stories,"I found the picture quality was not very good. Also, wasn't what I expected. I thought I was going to get ghost stories but instead I got people looking for ghosts. It's not what I wanted."
1,Messy,"Definitely moisturizes - but it's overkill! Ends up being an oily, uncomfortable mess! I used one suppository, but probably won't use again unless absolutely necessary!"
1,Nothing new in here,"The book was very outdated and there's nothing new to learn that couldn't easily have been googled. As for visiting Cape Verde, we LOVED it."
1,Worst yet...,"Not horrible, but definitely the worst of the series yet. In order of quality: 2, 1, 3, 4. Hopefully 5 will be better."
1,"NOT as advertised, this is a mono splitter","Just received this splitter for a trip I am about to take, but upon testing of this splitter I'm very disappointed. This splitter does not give 'stereo' audio to both headsets, it gives left channel to one and right channel to the other, each with one ear only. Unless you somehow need this, stay away get a different one."
1,Santa Claus: the Movie,I thought the sound quality was poor. I had to turn it way up to be able to hear the voices but it made the background noises too loud.
1,Wait Before You Buy,"This book has some valuable information in it. However, it is probably an obsolete book because everything you need is readily available online using your smartphone, iPad, computer, etc. If you can't find what you need without this book, you probably need to find another occupational pursuit."
1,Extended Editions Please! This one is a waste of money!,"I can't believe that New Line Cinema decided not to make the extended and the theatrical all in one package! It's a rip-off, and anyone who likes LOTR will know this! MAKE AN EXTENDED EDITION SET PLEASE!"
1,Cable length not as stated.,"I choose this rating because I have not been able to use the item yet. The item is supposed to have a 16-1/2 foot cable. The cable goes from the pump to the solar panel. The cable attached to the pump I received is LESS than 10 foot long, so I don't have enough cable length from my bird bath location (that can't be moved) to where the solar panel needs to be located to be in direct sunlight. So, the item doesn't do me much good as it won't run without sunlight on the solar panel and the cable to too short to allow the panel to reach a sunny area. FALSE ADVERTISING! Think twice before purchasing this item if you need a sufficient length of cable as you will be disappointed."
1,Will NOT Buy because of UV,Saw this at the movies and was set to buy the disk but not worth it if UV is the only digital option. The previous movie had iTunes download and my kids still watch it. We'll be skipping this purchase.
1,What a DISAPPOINTMENT !!!!,"I am a big Steven Seagal fan. I wish there was something good I could say about this movie. Unfortunately, I purchased it on DVD (which had no added extras, except trailers) and was really disappointed. I would recommend any of Mr.Seagal's other movies. But not this one. If you are thinking of purchasing it anyway, then please rent it first."
1,Lots of limitations,"The video shows an experienced welder using stick arc welding to weld plates together. No coverage of stick selection by size or type, no information on how to insure a strong weld with good penetration, no mention of how best to weld materials of different thicknesses, and no information on using wire arc welding equipment.One would be better off watching a couple of Youtube videos than buying this video on DVD or even buying a book with photos."
1,HILARY CAN SO NOT SING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"DO YOU KNOW WHY THIS ALBUM GETS SO FEW BAD REVIEWS? IT'S BECAUSE ALL THE (SMART) PEOPLE HEARD HER FIRST ALBUM AND KNEW IT WAS TRASH SO THEY DIDN'T BUY THIS ONE, SO THEY DON'T REVIEW IT. HILARY IS JUST NOT A GOOD SINGER! HER VOICE IS COMPUTERIZED-SOUNDING, AND SHE IS TOO IMMATURE TO BE IN THE PROFESSIONAL MUSIC BUSINESS! SHE IS LIKE A LITTLE GIRL WHO THINKS SHE CAN SING WHO SOMEONE STUCK UP ON STAGE."
1,You've got to be kidding,"This is the same old - same old. George Strait has not had an inventive musical idea in the last 10-15 years. He is so far removed from his best days that it is not funny. And there is no reason for it. GS could be turning out some great albums, he still sounds fantastic. But he is on autopilot and you can tell. Whoever it is that is choosing these songs - be it GS or someone else - needs to be canned immediately. They are horrible. GS has completely changed his style and has become part of the modern country music scene...that's too bad. Don't expect any more albums as good as ""Does Ft Worth Ever Cross Your Mind"" or ""chill of an Early Fall"". He'll just keep churning out this uninspired music until his career ends...because people will keep buying it. He hasn't had a decent single since ""She doesn't like me anymore"""
1,think twice you buy this,"Even, this product was rated as compatible to Mac, it does not work with certain Macs, G3 PowerBook (Pismo) is one. Tech support does not understand why."
1,"If you want to read a research paper, read this....","I have read other pieces that covered motor racing in the 50's and 60's, and this book read as if it was a research paper. Although the author was detailed in his accounts, he would change subjects frequently and the separation of chapters seemed random. Knowing about some of the events he wrote about, Yates seemed to rush through the races only to repeat a point as if it was his thesis statement. He would state his points bluntly instead of letter the reader discover what he was trying to say through a vivid account of what had occurred."
1,Female John Grisham she isn't!,"This could be an enjoyable book if the language could be cleaned up somewhat. There are too many loose ends left dangling at the end of the book. Much too long for the content. I have read most of the other reviews & I agree that it isn't a total waste of time, but she is not a female John Grisham."
1,Don't waste your time.,"Bad, very bad. I could not finish the book, which is very rare for me.So many problems in the technology and facts. Poor story line."
1,"Beautiful prose, just not my cup of tea","I am writing this review weeks after finishing the book. So please excuse the generalization. Although I found the prose to be beautiful, the story line was slow moving. I understand this was written during a different era, so perhaps this would have been considered a page turner nearly a century ago. However, it was interesting to compare society's perceptions of infidelity and having a baby out of wedlock during Forster's time to those of today. Really, things are really not that different!"
1,Horribly OFFENDING,"If you are going to make a movie called ""The Craft""(which IS a religion by the way), then make one about another religion. Call it ""Judaism"", and fill it with lies about Jews! If that last statement was offensive then you can see why we as Witches are offended by this movie."
1,dismay,This book repeats without permission without proper attribution of original material found in my book THE EPSTEINS A FAMILY ALBUM published in London in 1984
1,Awkward to Use/Handle,"I love Rummikub and the notion of a travel version to play any where was VERY attractive. However, the pieces are so small and flimsy they are hard to keep in the player tray and keep in place on a playing surface. A magnetic playing surface / tile combination would be much more functional and enjoyable. I'd not buy this version again."
1,What is all the fuss about?,"What a strange, and progressively bizarre, series. I was very disappointed. Fortunately there was missing audio volume so I could send it back. It puts me off buying other BBC TV productions."
1,cute l,this bird looks real sounds real but the churps have no rest time its ongoing but I plan to hang it in a tree in the spring in hopes that it scares away squirrels from bird feeder
1,jung vs freud,the movie follows the development of freud and jung's relationship over a decade. the movie nicely depicts the narcissism of freud and his difficulty tolerating anyone who was not an avid admirer or who challenged his beliefs. unfortunately freud served as model for the development of psychoanalysis. jung challenged freud and was excommunicated from freud's church. keira knightly plays a patient of jung's who he stops therapy with and then beds...somewhat similarly to freud bedding his sister-in-law in terms of boundary violations. a dangerous method is a good name for remnants of psychoanalysis still in existence.
1,Truely hideous artwork,"This is the worst looking tarot deck I've seen in years. I give it 1 star only because that's as low as the ratings go. The artwork is unattractive at best. Major problems I have with it include: 1) the high priestess looks like a man, 2) the Heirophant looks like a woman, 3) the ""humanoid"" charachters have been stripped of their sexuality, 4) a Magen David on every other card (it really gets old fast), 5) lame geographic symbols on the minor arcana suggesting that the artist ran out of ideas and had to beat a deadline. If you are a colorblind Jewish woman hater, then this could be your deck. Otherwise, get a real good look at it before you buy."
1,Bad Packing,Poster was packed in such a way that it arrived wrinkled and folded. It should have been wrapped around a tube to protect it. (Dissatisfied)
1,Mediocre at best,"I'm a big fan of the C&C; series but Generals isn't the same game at all.There is absolutely no storyline. Aside from a few scripted events here and there, you might as well be playing a Skirmish against the Artificial ""Intelligence.""The pathing is terrible. Worst I've seen since the original Age of Empires. Units have a terrible tendency to move in single-file lines or get stuck on each other, especially in the very cramped maps. They will also just sit there getting shot at if the enemy is out of thier range.Damage and rate of fire need to be adjusted across the board. If Iraq had mobile launchers that could fire Anthrax-loaded SCUDS every 5 seconds...On the other hand, the graphics and music are great."
1,Not air-tight as advertised...flour beetles repeatedly get in,"While these containers are indeed cheap options for storing flour, they are by no means air tight. After having some problems with flour beetles, I threw out all of my old flour, bought these containers, and put new flour into them. Within about a week, flour beetles were in my all-purpose flour, bread flour, and rye flour."
1,GREAT GAME,"AFTER SO MANY YEARS I STILL PLAY THIS GAME AND HAVE FUN WITH IT. I REMEMBER WHEN I WAS LITTLE AND HAD TROUBLE FINISHING THIS GAME, ESPECIALLY WITH THE PART OF THE RIDDLE OF THE SPHINX. EVEN THOUGH I LEARNED THIS GAME MANY YEARS AGO, I STILL PLAY IT, EVEN THOUGH I DON'T GET ANYTHING BACK BUT THE SATISFACTION OF WINNING AND SPENDING A GOOD TIME. IT'S A GOOD GAME TO PLAY OVER AND OVER AGAIN IF YOU HAVE TIME AND LIKE TO HAVE FUN."
1,Did not work: usb printer to parallel port on laptop.,"The cable did not work when connecting a usb printer to a parallel laptop port under Windows 95. Maybe it would work for a parallel printer to a usb laptop port under Windows 95, but that was not what I bought it for."
1,No one over the age of 13 should watch this movie!,"Many people, mainly Adam Sandler and his few friends, thought that this movie was funny - it isn't. Look Who's Talking is funny, Three Men & Baby is funny, more recently Ace Ventura and The Mask are funny, but this isn't. All the best bits, which everyone's seen in the trailer, seem long winded and drawn out in this movie. Big Daddy Small Laughs I'm afraid. Sure kids will love it, anyone under the age of 13 will laugh at Sandler's goofy face, it's just all-round hilarious kids movies have been made before and are at the cinemas now, don't waste your money or time with a half-witted video that your kids will grow out of in less then a week. Trust me, they would like Ace Ventura, Bugs Life or Chicken Run better than this pile of Adam Sandler."
1,Ok. But not for kids.,"Not happy endings and a lot of death.No plot. No climax. Booooooooring! But language was interesting. Basically, it w as ok"
1,Disappointed Reader,"Like so many others who have written reviews for this book, I am an avid Patrica Cornwell reader. This book indeed is a departure from her other books. I am just a little over halfway through it and have to force myself to pick it up and read another chapter. This book makes me think that Cornwell dusted off one of her first attempts and got it published because of her reputation. I cannot believe a publisher would have accepted this book if submitted by an unknown author. NOT an enjoyable read!"
1,Both Biblically and scientifically invalid,"This book advocates breastfeeding strategies that will work for some women, but will produce dehydrated or failure-to-thrive babies for others. Not every mother produces enough milk to go 3 hours between feedings and still satisfy the newborn's need for nutrition. Babywise can be dangerous to the health of your newborn."
1,"great idea, but outdated technology","Bought this for the aged parents thinking it would be a nice alternative for the pricey PC system they are constantly having problems with.BIG MISTAKE. Set up was simple, instructions were very clear. However, MSN-TV uses a three or four year old version of Explorer. In addition to outdated software, there is no memory. So, many websites will not load. The new funtionalities on many sites will not run.All the MSN-TV is good for is e-mail. If that's all you need, then this might fit the bill. For any other purposes, look elsewhere.As for the speed - well, let's just say that the aged parents are retired, but even they don't have THAT much time to waste.All in all, a great idea which needs a lot more work. Wait for the X-Box or Sony Playstation with web browing/e-mail capabilities. At least then, the grandkids can also use it while visiting."
1,A huge step down for Sigur Ros: emotionless,"I thought their last two releases comprised some of the most beautiful, fresh, progressive, emotional music in the last few years. But this recording is a big step down. You know how much you love the Nothing Song, and appreciate the live versions you download through file sharing? Well, here the version lacks any of the pathos, any of the despairing urgency. Rather, all of the songs on this album homogenously blend together in a kind of self-loving soup. As we hear the same couple of words repeated over and over, the music never goes anywhere, and its one groove isn't particularly profound or heart-rending. Rather than moving and fresh --as their last two albums-- the listener is now left feeling the lead singer is some really pretentious guy singing in the shower. Self-love and complacency come across here, rather than the pensiveness and raw, quiet emotions that made them great."
1,BORING,Words cannot describe how boring this is. And it is not so bad that you can make fun of it. It is just plain dull. Elevator musak would seem like Metallica next to this dreck. Whiners whining about trivial things to music that is just plain dull.
1,"Expected to love it, gave up on it.","I had heard such great things about this book, so was really looking forward to reading it. I read to chapter 22, then quit. I thought it was extremely boring and very slow moving. I agree with some of the other reviewers that the author's situation and the subsequent discovery of her manuscript was so intriguing, I expected the book to be the same, but I was very disappointed."
1,Danger,"My new baby kitten was choking last night - luckily I woke up and pulled a 6 inch piece of this out of her mouth and stomach! not sure how she chewed a piece off or how long it was inside of her (it was soaking wet), but good thing she was in my bedroom or she might not have made it! My cats do love this toy - about 6 months ago I found a two inch piece inside some of my older cat's poop....guess I should have thrown it away then!!"
1,Unspeakable is Unbelievably boring.,"It sounded like it would be cool, a shrink with a brain machine that could tell if criminals awaiting execution were actually guilty or not by reading their brains. Unfortunately the script is not well written, characters and their purpose are unclear, the acting is choppy and direction is none existent. It's kind of like the X-Files, you get drawn into the story, but lose interest when you realize that nothing will be answered for the simple reason that the writers and directors would rather be cute instead of telling a story."
1,Just... A... Little... Slow... and Incomplet.....,"It appears most reviewer either loved ""Red Dirt"" or hated it. I certainly wish I'd liked it better. The cinematography is gorgeous (as everyone agrees); I'm okay with the acting; the script, however, slowly, ponderously, goes nowhere--which is the point of this film, I suppose. I recommend renting this film if you're hankering to experience vicariously the life of a young, bored, gay man (but not out to himself or anyone) trapped by circumstances and a dysfunctional, immediate family to continue in an empty, unfulfilled existence in the deep South, rather than take some chances, make some changes and move on."
1,Probably Not Authored By David Drake,"LT. Leary Commanding (LLC) is an almost unreadable book. I'd be surprised if he actually wrote it, as Drake is much too good an author to have been the source of this nonsense. Reading ""Superman"" is more productive, since you only have to believe in ONE superbeing; LLC has you believe in commanders who never make mistakes, some subordinates who have the real desire to serve that would shame a 17th Century English nobleman, and others who have a supernatural capability to access any database at any time. Even Superman didn't have all these advantages, being stuck only with flying and X-Ray vision. Buy some other book."
1,good,"its something fun to have. When offroading, it bounces around a ton and the numbers/lines stop far before you get close to flipping (at least in my jeep). Also, this whole unit swivels on the stand it comes with, so if you touch it, the fore/aft zero is thrown off. which is fine if you're driving to the mall. But not out in the sticks where you're almost never on level ground. Basically, this is something cool to look at. It doesn't do anything for offroading though, I took mine off after a couple trips to Mt.Ranier."
1,Stay Away,"You should stay away from this whole series. Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time moves at a glacial pace. He has far too many characters. He's turned his main hero, Rand, into such a wimp I'm rooting for the Dark Forces. It takes Jordan multiple books to wrap up scenerios that should take a few chapters. I'm sorry to hear he is ill, but he will die before he can come close to finishing this series. If you want to read an exciting series that actually accomplishes something within each book I would recommend George R.R. Martin's a Game of Thrones."
1,"DRM causes a mess, again. Thanks.","Beautiful movie. Typically Pixar. I actually went to a cinema to see it (which, here in Germany, is usually getting too expensive for my taste), and didn't regret it at all.Bought the DVD as soon as it came out - yes, actually thought the movie good enough that I want to see it again on DVD, despite it not being particularly cheap.And the DVD doesn't play, thanks to some DRM (Digital Restriction Mess-Up). It doesn't play, because it does not adhere to the DVD standard, thus (by definition) not being a DVD. So I paid a LOT of money - to get nothing.Thanks. Disney. Well done. Wish I could give you Zero Stars.Certainly an excellent way of making sure I buy even less DVDs than I already do, and certainly none ever again from *you*."
1,Best for beginning research,"Having spent the last two years researching my ancestors, I found this book a disappointment. It told little that I didn't know and actually didn't confirm some of what I did know. Now, I need to buy all the smaller volumes to see what they might contain? No thank you. I think I shall see if a library can find them. So, if you are starting your research, this is a great place to start but don't get too excited. It is a rather limited book."
1,Atrac Software Problem,"I really like the hardware I purchased, but the ATRAC software has been nothing but trouble for me. It does not work appropriately and has even crashed my system a couple of times. I would give the hardware 5 stars, but for SONY to issue such cheesy software is well below my usual expectations for their products."
1,Sand in this salt,"This is an awful product. It leaves sand in your food and bottom of cooking pans after boiling something. Why there are so many 'excellent' reviews leaves me wondering...Who's really behind these reviews? Granted it may be ""Natural & Organic"" but so is dirt. I do not think there are THAT many folks who love to eat grit!"
1,This bag DOES NOT CLOSE?,"I bought this bag to use as a overnight bag and to take on weekend trips. The body of the bag easily fits the amount of clothes etc required for a few days away...BUT the bag does NOT CLOSE. AT ALL. Apparently ther is some sort of built in hidden magnetic closure that is supposed to secure the top flap to the front of the bag. This does not work (at least on my bag).WORSE STILL, even if this magnet thing worked, the sides of the flap are still totally open, and anything small that you have in your bag can fall out if thebag is in anything but a perfectly upright position.So much for using this as a carryon bag, or putting it in the trunk of a car. It is totally unreliable. I am definitely returning this bag."
1,frustrated,"we paid for this item (plus express shipping)it came 4 weeks later...and it will not accept any downloads from itunes, even after going through the latest itunes update...so we are 5 weeks from our order and still without music...help!"
1,Blah!!!,Living in a area of low humility this requires too much water. It did not cool a 12x12 room nor would the machine fit into the design of my home
1,TOO DARK AND MOODY FOR ME!,"I think that Ian McKellen and Judy Dench are two of the greatest people working in the film today. McKellen turned in a rather Shakespeare-esque performance as Magneto in X-MEN, and Dench has proved herself as a good M in thel last three JAMES BOND epics. So I was surprised that this film turned out to be a waste of time. Trying to capture the Bard's stage vision, Trevor Nunn screws up everything with this lumbering two-hour-and-sixteen-minute film. There are no sets, just blackness, making the dark tragedy TOO dark. The costumes are no good whatsoever. The acting is just plain terrible! The only saving grace in this film is Roger Rees. Please miss this peace of crap not worth seeing. Either watch Roman Polanski's version, or wait for Kenneth Branagh's version to come out. They're better than this is, I'm sure. Grade: D-"
1,poor representation of a great show,"This movie doesn't even come close to the quality of the show. They didn't get a number of important characters from the original cast, a ton of things in the movie weren't explained, and the plot felt very forced.Unless you're a fan of the show, this isn't worth watching. And even then, it's a stretch."
1,Very uncomfortable,"The sound quality and functionality of the headset are fine, comparable with others. However, the comfort is just terrible. Not only is it tricky to put on, but after an hour or so of wear, it is very painful.Since I use a headset for hours a day, this one was no good for me."
1,Took it back,"I bought TT, but returned it after reading the reviews. I bought Tax Cut and it worked great."
1,UGH!,"Touted as the greatest anime ever produced my friend and I who are huge anime fans rented this POC (piece of crap)....... Mediocre animation, lousy story.... the best part was close to the beginning when the fat kid gets punched in the mouth and pukes up a bunch of blood..... THAT'S it! Worst Anime I've ever seen!"
1,Bacon you stink agian,"Kevin Bacon is one of the worst actors in the world and this is his worst.It had no guidence as to what the movie is about.It starts out like its gonna be a great film in the begining because the guy goes bankrupit,and your thinking wow I can't wait ans see how he's gonna get back on his feet and then he becomes a messenger for some reason and falls for another messanger named terry who is a bumb.Some guy comes in the picture you don't get a good idea who he is and for some reason wants to kill's all the messangers."
1,Amazing!!!,"Amazing that anyone could possibly think that this is their best work yet. DT spent very little time on this and it shows. Many of DT's efforts are hard to describe because they were so original and well refined. How many people here have said 'it sounds like Metallica' or 'it sounds like early....'. That's the point. There's nothing new or creative with this effort. I agree with a couple of the comments about 'Honor Thy Father'. Might as well listen to some mindless, boring, monotonous rap. 2 stars for their talent, 0 for creativity."
1,noise,i've tried two different db converters in my 2008 jeep wrangler. I keep getting static or distortion from the woofer when i turm the volume past 17. Sometimes I get the same noise when the volume is lower. I dont want to change the head unit. I'll try a different converter before I get rid of the factory unit. i hate not being able to turn the volume up as loud as i want
1,Feeding The Masses,"A poor rip off of Romeo's zombie flicks. I love horror movies but this one was not a favorite. Low budget and special effect were lacking. Story plot unoriginal, you have seen it before and it was done much better in other movies. Stick to George Romeo's ""Night of the Living Dead"", ""Dawn of The Dead"" and ""Day of the Dead"" if you want to see how zombie flicks should be done.This one was a big disappointment and I would save your money, rent it or better yet borrow it from someone who owns it, if you have to check it out for yourself."
1,Von Daniken Redux,"Tippler has managed to create a work that surpasses, CHARIOTS OF THE GODS.This work shows why scientists should not write on religious subjects.It is laughable."
1,The Worst I've Ever Eaten,"I started a low carb. diet and have been trying different brands of turkey jerky. Golden Valley Natural Turkey Jerky ""BLACK PEPPER"" was by far the worst I have ever tasted. I've never left a review about any product I've purchased, good or bad, but I had to say something about this. It literally tasted like candied meat. It has 6 grams of carbs per serving (all from sugar)....double that of any other I've found. Why would any company put so much sugar in a turkey jerky labeled black pepper? They should have just called it brown sugar turkey jerky. I threw it in the trash and got a refund from Amazon. Amazon truly is an incredible company and I will continue to make purchases via their venue, but this turkey jerky......?"
1,BORING and $$$,"The characters are lifeless, the action mired in quicksand, and the price outrageous. What were the other reviewers thinking??"
1,"it's not a horror, it's crap!","story of a commune who are afraid to go into the woods because creatures are skinning all of their animals.i won't go into any further detail because it's just too ridiculous to waste much more of my time on this sorry excuse for a movie.what's most shocking about it is how so much good talent is wasted here.for the hour and 40 minutes you wait for something interesting to happen and nothing really does.one thing suprised me in the film but than it turns into just your usual hollywood cliche which carries itself throughout the movie.yes shamalyan did a good job with the sixth sense but don't let him fool you in thinking that he's a great director.this is one of the worst films in recent memory and all i can say is don't waste your money on this turkey.if you're thinking it's going to be scary,it's not,as it is more of a drama than anything.just pure crap!"
1,"""Field of Souls"" is a weak effort by Wayne Watson.","Recently, I had the great misfortune of hearing Wayne Watson's ""Field of Souls"". I guess I would describe his style as religious syntha-crap. Watson has provided American listeners with one of the corniest sounding collages of computer generated unpleasantness that I have heard to this day. Watson has the artistic integrity of N' Sync on crack, and the talent to match."
1,i have not received this cd!,"please check with vendor because i have not rece4ived this cd, yet. I am anxious to receive before I purchase future items."
1,Do Not Buy,"Radioheads albums were meant to be hear in their entirety. Each album is unique and representative of the progression of a great band. Do not buy and album released by a sour former record label. Their only objective make up for the revenue they lost when radiohead decided to branch off and release In Rainbows on their own without a major record label. Don't fall into the trap of supporting a label who's interest is in money, not music."
1,Works Great - sort of,I've owned the product 3 months. I purchased this product because I'm a middle aged person with braces and found the full size water pik setup to be invaluable dealing with the situation. If this product didn't have the following shortcomings I'd rate it 5 stars because it is a tool I use every day. Design issue #1: The battery. The water pressure just isn't there anymore and this thing is only 3 months old. As it runs you can hear it slow down as it pumps the water #2 The charger inlet falls open easily and water gets in the charging area. BAD. #3. There is no good way to clean out the water holder and it goes stale. I've taken to flushing it with mouth wash and storing it open and upside down.
1,A love affair between two narcissists. Huh?,"I have the impression that the affair between Chanel and Stravinsky was in fact a trivial adventure for the both of them. Chanel did couture and Stravinsky did music, but neither made much of a mark on the other. How could they? They were a couple of megalomaniacs. So, it's not clear to me why anyone would try to write a love story about two people who didn't love one another.On the DVD there's a short movie; 'The Making of Coco and Igor', which is instructive. We see the actors and film makers having a heck of a time trying to figure out what this movie is about and why they are making it. And not finding out.Unless for the outfits and the interior design."
1,"Cheesy, clichÃ© but sooooo funny. I laughed so much until I almost cried!","It's the most hyped, fake, and silly spy story I have ever seen in my life: cheesy, clichÃ© but sooooo funny.I enjoyed it. I laughed a lot until I almost cried!The tragedy is on the producer/actors's side.They were and still are convinced that they made a...serious masterpiece instead of a laughing-out-loud piece of entertainment.Now that they know, hopefully they will change genre in the future and make a comedy, in order that we may be moved to tears this time.That would be nice!Interesting to see the reviews on this one all over the place! I could not recommend highly enough this one to any of my friends or family, and their children as well! Ugh!"
1,This game is vaporware.,"Please, its going to be released October 30, 2003. That will be what, its 6th year of development? Don't waste your money preordering a product that isn't coming out. If it came out now, even with its severely dated graphics it might succeed with a niche audience. But with a release a year away it would flop horribly."
1,"no pause, ff, rewind...","The show itself is pretty typical cirque, some great acts and some terrible camera work/editing. But this one you can't even control the disc. When you try to pause, rewind,... it won't let you.You get to sit there and watch. If you go to the bathroom or whatever, you miss stuff. Too bad."
1,Mireille Mathieu not sings in spanish,"content of the TOTAL DIFFERENT layer of the content of the compact disc. The musics are not in Spanish and yes in the original versions. Product is false. BMG deceives the people. I am disappointed, unsatisfied. I bought thinking that Mireille Mathieu sings in Spanish this cd."
1,Don't Believe The Hype...,"I bought these speakers thinking that they would provide above average sound for playing MP3's, POD streaming, etc...These speakers sound like they have a wet towel sitting on top of them!! I'm currently trying to find an EQ download program to try and adjust them to something I can tolerate. I'm a Bose fan but I am very dissapointed..."
1,Retch,"Probably the worst book I've ever red. Plotlines going nowhere, phony ""vikings,"" meaningless torture and rapes and the constant brutalizing of women. But most of all, its just plain BONE CRUSHINGLY BORING!"
1,Not a great movie!!!!,"This movie was totally unrealistic. The whole show takes place within a short period yet four people fall in love, a little boy wins the hearts of two people, and a liver transplant gets diagnosed, an operation takes place and a recovery all just a few weeks before Christmas. It is not realistic at all. The writers didn't even show time passing to make it more believable. Also the man goes home because he decides he doesn't want to be a doctor anymore. Well it seemed like he lived a long ways away (at least in another town). Yet when someone is sick he takes them to his hospital where he worked even though it is a life and death situation. Also the little boy goes to the hospital to see his teacher and how does he get there? The whole movie is like that: very unrealistic."
1,Not a good deal from Amazon,"I was very happy to find a Light Wedge at Amazon at a discounted price, but when it arrived the acrylic panel had numerous fine scratches on it and some larger deeper scratches as well. Scratches light up brightly when the wedge is illuminated, and are as annoying as trying to read through scratched eyeglasses. Clearly the product had been used or shopworn, although Amazon claimed it was 'new'. When I tried to return it, Amazon told me that they could not replace it with a new one because they were out of stock. So beware.When a light wedge is in good condition, it is a very pleasant book light, much less annoying than ordinary lights to others in a room or beside you on an airplane. They are a little heavy if you have to support the weight of your book while reading. And, the acrylic lens is easily scratched, so a protective case is probably a good idea for the times when your wedge is not stuffed in a book."
1,A treatise on the authors life experience,"If you want to read about the authors life experiences rather than keeping, breeding and care of Angelfish, this book is for you. I ordered it thinking it would deal with the latter, not the former and was ratherdisapointed in its contents. I suppose that Drs. Axelrod and Burger have led active tropical fish hunting expeditions and thought they should share their adventures with the readers. I think you would be better off with an early edition of William T. Innes ""Exotic Aquarium Fish"". It has a detailed write-up on the keeping, breeding and care of fresh water Angelfish. Although this book has been out of print for many years, It may still be available on eBay or gathering dust in some book stores."
1,Disappointing!,"I was assured that all the songs were ""Studio"" by the shop. So I bought it, only to find ""Sweet Caroline"" to be LIVE and DISGUSTING!The person who compiled this box deserves this compliment: SHAME! SHAME! SHAME!RICK"
1,MATCH LIGHT ONLY!,"If you think this SportCat is truly a ""flameless"" heater, then you've been fooled, just like I was. Obviously, Coleman does not consider the firey red glow of a match to be a flame. Yes, this is a MATCH LIGHT ONLY appliance, which is not, in my opinion, ""flameless"" and consequently not safe for in your tent. Don't wait till you open the box to discover this. If you are a Coleman faithful, then you'd be much happier shelling out the extra dough for the ""luxury"" model that includes an ignitor. By the way, in order to warn people of this deception, Amazon.com required a valid credit card from me. So you are now guaranteed I am a verified reviewer!!"
1,Piece of junk!,"Lasted about 4 weeks. Full of holes after that. Only used it about 4 times. Junk! Don't waste your money, get a real hose."
1,"If you like blurry pictures and typos, this one's for you!","Could have been a real fun gift for Gator fans...but so little care has gone into this, it's a shame. Many other books out there that live up to their titles. Take a pass."
1,Big let down,"I'm not surprised that no-one else has reviewed this book, as it was a great disappointment to me, even though I'm part of the intended audience - a professional photographer changing from film to digital. Unfortunately I found little new information here, and what I did find was not clearly enough explained for me to be able to apply. Perhaps the greatest disappointment, though, are the images. I never fail to be inspired by images in other Amphoto publications, but those in this book are too ordinary to warrant publication or emulation. Guess I'll go back to learning the hard way - by trial and error."
1,Terrible example of modern music.,This CD is quite possibly the worst CD in my collection. The songs are all annoyingly the same and I found most of the lyrics offending. This CD is absurd.
1,Quality worsened over the years (or fake product),"I previously had a Motorola Razr V3 and this definitely doesn't seem like the same product. The build quality of this one feels cheap (the battery compartment has a thin plastic sheet, buttons seem flimsy, the front lcd is a bit stained... and the overall sense is that it wasn't assembled well).Not to mention the 6 pages manual: my printer at home would've done a better job (which makes me really feel this is a fake product).Good news is that it turns on and seems to be working, but from the build quality, I don't think this will last too much. Just realized looking the reviews that the good reviews are really old -- all the new ones do state that this is a fake phone :(So, hoping that this will be seen by new buyers before buying this junk."
1,This is a RIPOFF! DON'T BUY!,"Wait a couple years till full season packs are released. This is just another Lucas-style money making scheme. Release only half the season and make it look like the price came down when you're really paying more for the full season. You've waited this long for it, you can wait a couple more years. I'm certainly not stupid enough to fall for this kind of a ripoff."
1,Color is not accurate,"The color here looks really light green, but in actuality it is a true shamrock green. The difference is huge from what you see here and on the Fiestaware web site. It's more grass-colored. The quality is fine, but the color is seriously misleading."
1,Hasn't improved in 35 years,"This was the first album I traded in way back when. I just played it on a streaming service to see if I was wrong. I wasn't.Pointless riffing, overdrawn song endings, endless repetition, meandering instrumentals, too much inter-song crap (including 3 minutes of band tuning at the start of ""Free Form""). Songs don't really resolve, they just end when everyone gets tired of playing.There are much better versions of ""Evil Ways"" out there; this one is OK, but seems rushed and I'm not that fond of Miles' howling throughout.I truly don't get the 5-star reviews of this. I've never been that stoned, including when I bought this new. If ""Hey man, lets get together and jam."" is your thing, then maybe you'll dig this. I don't.Oh yeah, it's miked badly too."
1,Purchased for school,This is another book by Borg that I would never purchase on my own. Borg is a proud member of the Jesus Movement and it appears that their main goal is to discredit the Jesus of the Bible and remake Him in the mold of one of many spiritual people throughout history.
1,NO GOOD,"This book is poorly organized and written. I wouldn't recommend to anyone who's serious about pursuing MCSE track. I read few other books on this topic and by far this got to be the worst. I only got little out of this book. Information on Subnetting, DNS, DHCP, WINS and other important issues barely scratch the surface of what we need for the test. I didn't understand what authors were trying to convey until I read other books to back up. This book's not worth your time, especially with that new Adaptive Test in town. Don't BUY it else you will regret."
1,Mostly a book of patterns,"If you are looking for an inexpensive book of just patterns, this will meet your needs. However the carving instructions are minimalist and there are no painting instructions. There is one color picture of each bird included."
1,Not the Best,"I'm sorry but I'm dissappointed with this video. The album Come On Over is played out. It's been two years since she released it and its about time we heard something new from her. The video has all her videos you can pretty much see on CMT anytime you like. There are also two videos (Come on Over & Honey I'm Home) which only show her in concent. A complete waste of time. If you want to watch quality made videos, do not buy this tape, instead watch Faith Hill on CMT!"
1,I'm a spiritual person but...,"I'm a very spiritual person, so these kinds of books are my kind of thing. I'm the first to dispense with traditional science and biology when it's convenient, since they're very complicated, and they don't cater to the emotional and spiritual needs of the ordinarily-minded person. A book like this one should give those of us who choose to turn our backs on ""proper"" science something to focus on instead in our search for health, longevity and freedom from pain. However, if we're replacing all the discoveries and benefits of science, it should be with something MORE intuitive, something MORE spiritually simple, than what traditional science and medicine have to offer. Otherwise, where's the alternative? If spirituality has to be so complex, we may as well just accept what we're running from in the first place: empirically measurable knowledge. I give this book two stars since, at 320 pages long, it's unlikely I'll ever read it."
1,Foosa...,"I didn't think much of ""Madagascar"". It sees a bunch of animals escape from Central Park Zoo, New York, only to be captured, deported, shipwrecked, and caught up in Lemur/Foosa politics on Madagascar and the instincts of the wild. It felt more like a TV special than a movie, and didn't really have much of an ending. I found the style of jokes kind of tired, just let me down a bit. Special features include some new footage of the penguins, among other things."
1,Good idea but poorly constructed project,"We gave this to our 7 year old daughter for her birthday and it was quite a disappointment. We had to order it 3 times. Each time it arrived, the sparkley dirt was open and spilled all over the entire project. The third time we ordered we decided to keep the item and deal with the spilled dirt. When she finally opened it to start the project there was a chip in the planter and the planter was really cheap and thin. Would certainly not recommend this product to anyone."
1,not happy :( book was in bad shape.,"I was very unhappy with this book. It was described as good shape, when it arrived I found that the spine was broken and multiple pages were ripped and discolored. I contacted the seller and got no response. That really sucks. I have had trouble with used product before but the seller always fixed the problem this one just ignored it. Buy from some one else if there is an option."
1,Good story but way too many characters and plots,"Three friends Kat, Josie and Perri make a pact when they are young, to always stand up for each other and to always stay together.One day a shot rings out in school, and kat is left dead... perri was shot in the face and Josie is shot in the foot.But the stories are not adding up with the evidence and the police dig deeper in to old family secrets and hidden agendas.I found this book a good story line, but so many characters and plots were too confusing. It switched back and forth between present and past time.It was too confusing to be a good book and I agree with the other reviewer, the ending sucked!!!"
1,Look for better quality elsewhere,It only lasted about 1 month before I had to throw it away. It developed a bad odor and did began accumulating mildew. I even installed it in a clean bathtub.
1,Kaballah of The Da Vinci Code,"This is not a book for the average christian. If you agree with the theology of ""The Da Vinci Code"" you will love this book. The author reaches up into heaven, and pulls Yeshua (Jesus) off of the throne, and makes him only a man. She has him being married, being the father of the apostles John and James (because rabbis had to be married, and the father of a son, according to Hebrew tradition...which Yeshua seldom followed!), and surviving his crucifixion. It is an interesting read, it gives much information about the various aspects of each sephirah, but I disagreed with much of the ""christian"" part."
1,This is not one of Ms. Cornwell's best. Hard to stick to.,"Being an avid fan of Ms. Cornwell, I have read all that she has in print so far. The Hornet's Nest was hard to ""get into"" and stick with unlike her other books that won't let you put it down. I, however, can not wait to see what she does next. I will always read her books for just that reason. She does need to stick with her medical examiner though."
1,My opinon....Crapola,"Lexmark is the worst product (right next to Compaq Computers) I have ever had the displeasure of using. I tried the cold water method, work a little while after ..great tip. The black cartride does dry out too fast!! So I am now looking into a good laser printer. Not sure what I will do about the color setup? I would get the refill kits, but why bother if the cartride is going to dry out all the time. It seems the red dries out quickest? Oh well..lesson well learned."
1,GOOD CAST SAVES THIS MEDIOCRE ROM COM FROM BEING A COMPLETE DISASTER!,"While 'You Again' is certainly watch-able trite, it really doesn't offer much in the way of laughs or insight into the subjected theme of the film. The cast does what it can with this familiar story and Betty White is always welcome, but in the end this one is a rental at best. At least the end cameo is a small payoff and dilutes the stale taste a little bit."
1,Sound Blaster Old Technology,"This product came out several years ago and does not have the technology for voice to text which is offered in Windows XP. It may be new out of the box, but it is not new technology."
1,Misleading Netgear ad,"Don't be misled by Netgear's ""plug and play"" claim. It's true only if you a using a Netgear wireless router and have no WEP. Otherwise, as indicated in the instructions, you are in for some serious configuration work. You'd better know what you are doing or be willing to pay a professional."
1,absolutely stupid,"I was looking for a fun book to read to my 2 year old one.Something that will be fun and meaningful so she would enjoy it.Yes, the pictures are colorful and the turkeys look silly and promising.But there is not one page that makes sense to me.It is not sillly in a funny way it is stupid and a waste of money.The pictures are so busy with these big eyed turkeys in it that you really don't get right away what you are looking at or the turkey is doing. The things the turkeys are saying makes no sense neither. It doesn't rhyme or sound funny to me at all.Certainly some will like this book and others don't.But if you are looking for a good book that will have both, humor and a bit of a story.. don't waste your money.This is not it.If shipping wouldn't cost me more then the book is worth I would mail it back.It is a total let down.I am going to search for a different book with humor and story that is fun to read.What a disappointment."
1,Avoid this product,"This software is a great disappointment. Here are some of the things it will *not* do.1. Won't backup over a network unless you remember to map network drives first2. Won't make incremental backups to a directory on a hard disk (this means you can't backup your laptop to a desktop unless you do complete backups every day)3. Won't allow you to select files to include in a backup (as opposed to exclude), such as *.jpg, for example, or files newer than a certain date.The last two options were avaiable in Norton Backup ten years ago, so there is no excuse for their exclusion in what is supposed to be a program that goes beyond the Windows 98 program.The program does not appear to distinguish between CD-R and CD-RW disks.Finally, the CD-R backups it produced were sometime unreadable, yet Veritas charge for technical support."
1,Mis-advertised.,"I wouldn't know how this product works as i never used it. It doesn't have an AGP slot as advertised, only PCIE X16. I returned it for a full refund."
1,"Small sound, no base but nice and portable","I received this as a gift for my baby's room. I wanted a small speaker system to play music from my ipod in my nursery. The item is nice and small and would travel really easy. It has a nice travel pouch, etc. The plug in the back started falling out day one and looked like it would easily get bent over time. The plug, which is jump rope length, wont fit into the travel bag. MAINLY....the problem is that the sound is like a very old clock radio that has had its speakers blown out. I don't even want to use it for the very small purpose I had planned. I ventured out to Frys today with my ipod and listened to several other small ipod docking speaker systems. There are SO many that have better sound, remotes, small size and other features like clock or AM/FM that I am returning this ASAP. Too bad Im going to be charged a restocking fee by the company amazon contracted through because the speakers are bad!"
1,Miss leading sdvertizement,The add said seisse of Switzerland designing only the very best in water filtration and purifcation products nothing about being made in Thailand miss leading. they sent me an add for $ 18.54 but I paid $24.21. You tell me I don't know
1,I don't remember it being this bad,"But then, my tastes in movies have improved since I was fifteen. The plot is see through, and the dialogue seems to have been stolen from every Navy SEAL book they can find (more SEAL cliches than WWII movies). Sheen is as transparent as usual in the over-the-top 'badboy' SEAL, who any commander worth anything would have kicked off the Teams. Micheal Biehn and Bill Paxton (who only had a small part) are both excellent actors who just picked a bad movie (Biehn's SEAL role in The Rock is a much better portrayal). This movie came about after the SEALs came to the attention of the world, but a poor script, bad acting, and bad directing make this movie just horrible."
1,Gods of ancient Crete,"You want /good/ temping advice, go to notmydesk.comYou want pure dreck, buy this."
1,"If there is a 0 star rating, that's what I'd use.","This is really a stupid program. It is not intuitive, not friendly, not useful and to sum it all: IT IS NOT FUN FOR ANY KIDS. ANYONE WHO IS SOPHISTICATED ENOUGH TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE HECK THE PROGRAM DOES WOULDN""T BE INTERESTED IN POKEMON!"
1,An ad for the model school/model convention industry,"This is a classic ""wolf designing the security system for the henhouse"" book. The author is a former owner of modeling schools who also gets paid to go to expensive modeling conventions supported by the schools. The advice in the book that modeling schools are worthwhile renders the whole book suspect. Avoid this one."
1,Be Warned!!,This was a great player while it lasted. I had it for around six months then it died. So be warned!!! It seems as though there are way too many people who have had this same experience. If you are looking for something that lasts you might want to try something else.
1,"Pretentious, Pedantic, Obscure","If you are looking for a dry, obscure, pedantic monograph that uses cryptic hieroglyphics to describe algorithms, well, friend, this text is for you! On the other hand, if you are looking for a practical text that can be read by non-Math majors, move on. THERE IS ZERO USEABLE MATERIAL that I was able to glean from the book, and I've been programming commercial search engines and parsers for 9 years.I have no doubt that the author knows what he's talking about, but the information is, for all practical purposes, encrypted and I don't have the keys.And the quotes from dead Romans and literary figures that are on most pages are just pretentious, distracting, and annoying.I'd love to get my money back."
1,This is awful,I can't even finish the book. The writing is terrible..quite juvenile. I bought it because it was recommended in Oprah magazine and I mistakenly assumed it would be quality. It's boring and the plot is weak. Sorry to say it!
1,Didn't work!,"This item was meant to be a gift for my father. So I simply wrapped the box without first testing it (I didn't want it to look pre-opened). It was quite embarrassing when he opens it and tries to plug it in but nothing happens. No light, no noise, no nothing. It simply had no power running through it. When purchasing this item, I had read some other reviews about this happening and figure: ""It won't happen to me!"" But it did, so it can. I was able to return it to Amazon for a full refund. So if you purchase this shredder, know it might come with a little extra hassle."
1,marine horn?,"The horn rusts on the inside and stains the deck. The manufacturer sent the following advise ""I would recommend you opening the Horn and clean out the collected liquid."" So after operated in a marine environment you need to open it up and dry it."
1,Arrant Rubbish,"Brown's success with The Da Vinci Code made his name. However not having read that book yet, I thought I'd try this one first. It is a cheap pastiche of (bad) science fiction, political machinations, and conspiracy. Exciting enough in a pulp fiction sense but far too much extreme heroism and contrived suspense.Having now read The Code, it by contrast deserves its popularity. I'm left with the view that Brown is a one-book wonder.Don't disappoint yourself with this book."
1,Software Sucks,"Bought the 8x6"" tablet from DigiPro (I no longer see that size tablet available, so am reviewing the smaller size).The software that came with my tablet would not install correctly (had a warning pop up that the Window's Logo Certification for the program was invalid or corrupted). Tried to install anyway, and none of the programs will actually start up. Terrific.Plugged in the tablet itself, and LCD light blinked continuously, but apparently will not work at all without use of the included programs (which are defunct). I'm gonna try to return this and get a Bamboo."
1,"Did not work -unless you like intermttent ""snow""","CNet reviews said HDMI cables are overhyped and that I shouldn't bother to spend more than $10 on a cable. Taking that to mean ""buy the cheapest HDMI cable available,"" I bought this one. Unfortunately, this one did not work properly. As a connector between my Mac and TV it alternated between showing the correct image and the screen being completely full of snow. I had previously used my boyfriend's HDMI cable and know that my setup can work perfectly. It's not worth the price to return this piece of junk, but certainly this wasn't worth the steal. Next I'll try one closer to $10."
1,Great Movie. Horrible DRM,"If you are thinking about buying the special addition for the ""Digital Copy"" you need to know Warner Brothers are lying to you.I ripped the digital copy to my XP machine. Transferred it to my Vista machine to stream to my 360. Apparently somewhere in that simple transaction, WB decided to DEACTIVATE the digital copy making it completely useless. Who are they kidding?Way to go DRM. I'm getting a refund. Save yourself some money and find this movie through other means."
1,Star Trek Legacy - What The Hell Am I Shooting At?,"The premise for this game is good, but not good enough. I was drawn to buying this game because #1 I'm a huge Star Trek nerd and #2 I like video games with lazers. However, I'm not sold on the idea of flying a star ship around like a fighter out of Starfox. The level of detail they could have taken this game would have made it 10x as much fun (i.e. doing damage control, boarding enemy ships, etc.etc.)But biggest of all is the controls. If you are prone to vertigo, this game is not for you. The camera controls are something to be dealt with as you're always attempting to figure out where the enemy is. Good sounds, good voice actors, nooooot that good gamer control."
1,Not sturdy...,"I like this diaper bag, though I wouldn't really call it a diaper bag. It's more of a big insulated lunch bag. The dimentions posted in the description are accurate, but look at a ruler first, don't eyeball it like I did. This bag will be great for short trips to the zoo or park, but not a long day or overnight trip. It's well made and has several pockets for a wallet, keys, etc. I probably wouldn't have gotten it if I'd realized just how small it is, but i'm keeping it because it's cute and will do the job until baby gets bigger.9/3/2011 - UPDATE - this bag fell apart at the seams after only a few months of light use. Don't waste your money. One star."
1,Bad coloration,"These earphones do weird things at 4kHz and above. No amount of EQ-ing seems to fix it. Get some Sennheiser CX300s, 400s, or 500s instead. As someone who has spent the past 10 years working with audio gear, trust me on this one. This is not brand favoritism, as I have other Sony headphones that I like (check out my headphones list). These are just bad."
1,Not up to Hall's standards,"Forests of the Night starts out promising. The main characters - Charlotte and Parker and their daughter Gracey - were certainly unusual and likeable at first. I was about a hundred pages in before I realized that this was a very silly book. The emotions of Charlotte and Parker became very contrived, and their relationship was just not worth reading about. The daughter receded more into her make believe world as the book plodded along, and her insanity did not make her a likeable or interesting character, just a schizoid nuisance. I've got about a hundred more pages to go, so I think I'll just have to tough it out.I have now (almost) read all of James W. Hall's books, and all the others merit five stars. He's a great entertainer and has been truly excellent at developing fun and interesting characters, with relationships sometimes touching on the wacky and weird. I just don't understand how he let this dog out of the cage."
1,DO NOT READ!,"The Pearl, by John Steinbeck,was a book I decided to read after a friend told me about it. It was fairly short and didn't hold any meaning. I truly think that this was Steinbeck's idea of Indians' poverty due to white man rather than a great idea for a novel. He used the two different societies and the doctor's greed to show how the white man tore the Indians apart. I think he chose a pearl as the jewel to be found because it is pretty close to white in color. The evil pearl buyers were also implied to be white people trying to kill Kino and his family for the pearl. The basic storyline could have been a descent novel had Steinbeck not thrown in all the other stuff. I would not recommend this book to anyone due to the content implied on the white man. If you must read this book, get it over quickly (you could probably finish in a day or so) and read The Count of Monte Cristo."
1,Just plain bad!,If you must read.. read in the book store and toss it on your way out.Don't expect King Lear here. This book is so bad that the fact that it is selling well scares me. Are we as Americans really that stupid or are we just a country of skate board riding baboons?Avoid this book! It is written by the someone profoundly intent on making money on cheese and sleaze. Don't look for any vestiges of class here. In 10 years America will be well into the slippery slope down to ignorance and apathy.
1,STOP IT ALREADY! DO NOT COME HOME EVER AGAIN!,"'Halloween part 6 The Curse of Michael Myers' is the worst entry in the series so far! After a fairly good installment with 'Halloween part 4 The Return of Michael Myers', they followed it up with, what I thought was the worst Halloween movie ever 'Halloween part 5 The Revenge of Michael Myers'.Now we have the abysmal 'Halloween part 6'. This movie is not only boring, it doesn't even try to be consistent with it's past sequels. What happened to Dr. Loomis's Scars on his face and hands? Why is Michael so big and brawny now? Why do they change the Shape's mask in every movie? This movie makes Jason X look like an Oscar winner! I have not seen the director's cut, but I doubt extra footage and editing could fix this boring and stupid mess! This almost makes Halloween part 5 look good!"
1,Can't give it Zero Stars,"I can't give it zero stars, but would if I could - for reasons listed elsewhere here. Belkin said nothing about the limitations of their product. I bought it a year ago for a trip using a camera with 512 MB cards. It actually worked ok, providing the iPod battery was fully charged. Now I have a 10MPXL camera with 2 GB SD cards and I'm out of luck. Can say that I'm happy that I bought my Media Reader for only 15.95 from JR. That kind of markdown should tell you something. If I'd paid anymore I'd be really mad. Shame Belkin."
1,Cheaper at CVS,CVS sells 6-packs of Ensure Plus for $9.49 at regular price (Target is even cheaper). That works out to $1.46 a bottle. If you buy these your paying just under $2.00 per bottle. Doesn't seem like a good deal to me. You can get them even cheaper on sale.EDIT: Actually I just checked. Walgreens sells them for $8.99 a 6 pack. So buy 4 of those for $35.96 or buy them here for $46.99. Your choice.
1,Be Warned!,"This product works intermittantly and product tech support is practically non-exsistant. The only people I can reach at LinkSys is Sales or Customer Service. It took me 4 days to set up the network hub portion. (I started with an operational network). Once the network was working I managed to get the DSL connection working on a couple of computers, not all. The next morning when I booted the network; no network and no DSL connection. Then no support. Returning product."
1,Toaster lasted 15 months...,"This toaster stopped working after 15 months. The warranty is basically worthless. You will spend 30 minutes on the phone trying to get someone to tell you how to collect on the warranty. Then you will need to box up the unit, take it to a UPS/FedEx store, and pay for shipping yourself -- all to get a new $60 toaster."
1,Get married early so we can have kids early?,"Silly me, I always thought people should get married when they felt emotionally and financially ready -and have kids when they were emotionally and financially ready, too! Thank heaven I have Danielle Crittenden to tell me that's all wrong. We should marry young because when we're ""older"" (like 30?!) men won't want us. All I can say to that, honey, is that any man who doesn't want me because he prefers young things is a man I DON'T WANT TO HAVE ANYHOW!"
1,Useless,"This program doesn't add any useful features to your GPS. It allows you to add things like ATM's, gas stations, etc.; all of which you would be able to find on the highway without using your GPS.In other words, don't waste your time."
1,Terrible sound quality,"While this has been my favorite Christmas movie since it first came out, and I love to watch it every year, I bought a used video from a seller on Amazon, and was so disappointed in it. The sound is so bad that it is almost unwatchable. A movie with the caliber of acting that this one offers should be as much a classic as It's a Wonderful Life, and be treated as such, not sold as a cheap copy. It deserves to be cleaned up and offered on DVD in high quality, so everyone can discover what a gem it really is."
1,Very disappointed,"Terrible product, I cannot believe there is a line for this... I think they just say sold out to make it more popular. I ordered this product and about a month later I got it. I was so excited to try it out.. and it worked great for about 3 hours... then it got stuck, it wont navigate away from the page that I was on. I tried to reset, take the battery out.. everything. Even the guys on the phone werent able to figure out the issue.I think the eINK technology has not integrated well with the amazon product. The customer service guys said this was a common problem and they would send me a new one. That turns off my interest in eBooks for the time being.This is a great product if it works...unfortunately for me, it was a terrible experience."
1,"Great live performance, ruined on DVD.","I bought this DVD when it was first released and the video looked very compressed and the menu navigation was messed up, this lead to Ultra Records recalling the DVD and sending me a new copy. The new copy fixes the menu and has improved video quality, but when playing this DVD through my Stereo and Headphones I noticed a major change in the DVD. THE AUDIO HAS BEEN MODIFIED AND SOUNDS WORSE THAN THE ORIGINAL DVD THAT WAS RECALLED. The change wasn't in the quality of the recording, but rather sounded like someone modified the audio track to have a lower tone in audio. I am not pleased with the change and would rather have my recalled DVD back with the original audio recording.If it weren't for the ruined audio I would have given the DVD 4 stars as it was a great show, but Ultra Records really messed up this DVD as I highly recommend no one buy it."
1,Baby Ballet Blah,"I bought this item for my 3 year old who loves to dance like a ballerina. I thought she would take to this DVD and learn the ""real"" moves. I got her dressed up and ready for her first viewing and she was quickly bored with it. The quality of the video is poor and uninteresting. The lessons are very very slow moving and it was hard to keep her interested in the rest of the DVD. I would recommend ""Barbi and the 12 Dancing Princesses"" over this for little girls who want to dance. My 3 year old learned all of her great turns and steps from them!"
1,THIS IS NOT AN ATOMIC WATCH,"I received this product in the mail today. When I opened the manual to learn how to use it, not once is their an explanation of how to use the Atomic timekeeping feature. I called CASIO direct to ask if this model was an atomic watch and they confirmed that it was not.BUYERS BEWARE!!!"
1,Do Not Buy,We ordered this card shuffler and had to send it back. It jams often and was very frustrating to use. We would not recommend buying it!!
1,mail slot sleeve,wrong size again.when you order mail slot you have to check to make sure that down thw page the extra that people buy is not check or elae you will get the wrong size.i had to call and have an agent for amazon order it and she evn had a hard time with the sleeve getting wrong size in the order!!trash it also it took 3 x to get the right size sleeve and i had to call for it!!rip off
1,Provencal Interiors?????,This is a nice book but it does not contain Provencal style interiors! I am not sure how the author came up with that title since anyone who is interested in French country will not find it here. If you are truly looking for Provencal decorating ideas-this is not the book for you. CONFUSED!!!
1,Big Disappointment,"I purchased this based on the raving reviews. It was great from November until January and then just disappointing. Without any warning, water would not leave the reservoir. I lost coffee for 12 cups (Ethiopian Yirgachaffe, so I was not pleased). I unplugged it and waited a week or so before trying again. It made sounds as if coffee was brewing or water heating, but the water remained in the reservoir. I only used bottled reverse osmosis water, so I doubt there was mineral buildup. I also cleaned the included gold filter thinking perhaps it was clogged. Nothing. I have a Cuisinart 4-cup brewer that has been successful and going steady for about a year. I expected the same with the 12 cup. I am glad it happened within time limit to return, however I am still left at a loss for brewing large quantities."
1,Dark dark dark,"Gymnastikos was very disappointing. The video did have nude gymnasts, however the lighting was horrendous and the models were always moving too fast for the camera to do justice to a potentially sensual and erotic video. I do not recommend this video."
1,"Craft as addiction, maybe?","I anxiously awaited the arrival of this book, given the reviews I'd read here and comments from others. I'm already a knitter and I had hoped the book would help me explain why I knit. Quite a disappointment.It seems to me the author has simply traded in one addiction (drugs) for another (knitting), and an equally destructive addiction at that. Sure, knitting carried her through some difficult times, but isn't that because addicts are able to shut out everything else in life because they are so focused on getting the next fix? Is it really OK to have a house so full of knitting projects that there's nowhere for your best friend to sit down?Her writing offers only a superficial and fleeting connection to some very important, very complex traditional/religious/spiritual practices; whether this is due to her own limited understanding or to an inability to communicate I don't know."
1,This picture is misleading,"If you take a good look at this picture the watch doesn't look plastic, I purchased several of these watches and the watches wasn't what I expected at all the watch should say little kids plastic watch. The size of the wrist band was so little as if this was made for a kid to wear. I felt so bad to pass these watches out to anyone. I just donated them to a toys for kids toy box at a local store."
1,Mas de lo mismo. Todo sigue igual,"Nuevo cd de Steve, Â¿seguro que nuevo? Â¿o tan solo su propio plagio de Fire Garden? Este hombre ya no tiene ideas. Las mismas escalas, los mismos arpegios, los mismos efectos. En definitiva, mas de lo mismo. Atras quedaron los tiempos del Passion and Warfare, una pena. Ya no aporta nada, que hay del fresco Steve Vai, de sus tiempos con David Lee Roth. Demasiado mayor supongo. La voz es horrible Â¿por que demonios canta el? Â¿acaso no tiene dinero para pagar un buen vocalista? Y tampoco los musicos, por favor, mete un buen bateria,un buen bajista y un buen teclista en todo el disco, tu limitate a tocar la guitarra, que es lo que sabes hacer. A ver si el proximo es mejor, porque es tu ultima oportunidad"
1,Not what I Expected,"The cartridges are not recognized by the printer as being full of ink so the annoying ""low ink"" indicator comes up everytime you print. I wouldn't say that it outweighs the savings, however it is annoying. As advanced as technology is these days there should be someone who can ""reset"" the cartridge and fool the printer into thinking the product is OEM and brand new."
1,Disappointing,"My Triplet 2 year olds have been watching videos from the Baby Einstein series since they were 6 months old. The quality of this one does not measure up to the rest. It seems almost like a 'home-movie'. The sound quality and music selecions are not as good and the visuals are slow. There is not much action, and for infants and young toddlers it is difficult to have much reference to what it is they are seeing (ie. that the puppets are reindeer, etc). I think the video should be more self-explanatory in some way so that the 'Christmas-uninitiated' will have more understanding of it. The boys will watch it but are not as captivated by this one as by the others. They seem to get more out of it now though than they did when they were 17 months (at Christmas)."
1,I wish I had read the reviews before I read this book!,"This is, without a doubt, the worst book on twins I have ever read! I would have saved myself a lot of tears and a week of depression had I heeded the warnings in these reviews.Frankly, I wonder if the reviewers who gave this book a positive review were reading the same book. It is so negative and pessimistic, I felt like Noble was trying to convince me that something would inevitibly go wrong and when it did, it would certainly be my fault. Not the kind of message you need when you are already in an emotional pregnant state of mind!Do yourself a favor and DO NOT read this book!!!"
1,over a month and still waiting,"I purchased two of these lasers over a month ago with the hope that they would make it here around christmas. Unfortunetly, the lasers have not yet arrived. The other items that I ordered that day arrived within two weeks."
1,Truthful and Disgusting,"I agree...this does happen all over the world...there are kids out there who live and act like the very kids in this movie. But just because it is a reality does not mean that I have to like the movie, and I definitely do not. My friends and I did some crazy, stupid things in high school, but we did not behave this way. My goal as a parent is to raise my son in a caring, loving, yet disciplining environment where he can make his own decisions but understand the consequences of his own actions. Hopefully (without sounding naive) I can give my son the tools to make good decisions so he does not find himself in these same situations."
1,"A very LAZY ""Restoration"".....","I bought the 2001 DVD box set and was happy with it, but when the Blu Ray set was released I was excited....Until I watched it!!The Blu Ray set does NOT look much different than the DVD set (which I set up side by side to check them out in my home theater). In fact, the DVD set on an upconvert DVD player looks BETTER!!Save your money and just buy or keep your DVD set, you WILL NOT be happy with the so called Blu Ray version....it's really just the DVD set on Blue Ray discs if you ask me.....and DARK too, some scenes are hard to see also....the dark is too dark even in a pitch black room as I have."
1,Almost over boys!,"This CD only gets two stars for the song ""Ride the Wind"" which is my favorite Poison song of all time!! Other than that nothing much to save this CD from the other early '90's hair bands that were going down. BTW, ""Ride the Wind"" is on the Best of.. CD which is much better choice!!"
1,crazy bad,"Where has Heather Nova's talent gone? what is up with this record. a friend burned me a copy and I have to say that the lyrics are pure drivel ... i can't even understand how this album was released. it is not up to par with heather's past work. I was looking forward to a stripped down, more rootsy album, but the songs aren't good enough. I give the album one star because the music is pretty and makes nice background music. I recommend starting with Oyster."
1,Bad Read from top 2 bottom!,"Whatever you think of when you think of a good book, This IS NOT! One of the worst I've ever read. Want proof that God exists: THIS guy has a best selling book!"
1,low camera angles and dry ice fog do not a movie make,"Wow, what a glorious disaster of a movie. I couldn't discern a motivation from any of the four characters. Stupid people doing stupid things and being either stuffy or melodramatic about it. Cringe-inducing performances linked by adequately artful cinematography and some easy-on-the-eye set design. But neither the paranormal nor the ""scientific"" explanations of what's going on have a leg to stand on. There are a few effective sequences, especially the bit with the ectoplasm, but, they're hamstrung by the simple fact that MONEY (let alone convictions about the paranormal) doesn't seem a believable enough motivation for supposedly intellgent characters to allow themselves to be repeatedly assaulted and maimed (and WORSE). I'm all for sustained mood in this type of film but for crying out loud- SOMEBODY tell a JOKE... make a funny remark... ANYTHING that might make the scares in between just THAT much more effective."
1,cheap,"feels cheap. hard plastic ball, heavy when kicked. does not come inflated. although it's the cheapest ball out there, i regret buying it, but not worth the trouble returning, so bought another ball that i'm very happy to play with my toddlers."
1,IPod owner,I just purchased this item with great expectations. I have owned it for approximately 1 hour. It does not work AT ALL. Every station has static. Maybe it is my car (infinity M45)-but this is a worthless and I am returning it.
1,Porter at sea,"I'm a pretty untiring reader, as long as I have faith I'm in competent hands, but I gave this book up at page 160, which was enough of an investment to convince me that Porter was lost, lost, lost. I'm an admirer of her short stories, but all she's done in this larger form is expand the cast of characters, forgetting to give them anything to do. The characters are really only cartoons, which Porter seems aware of, since she doggedly gives us paragraphs and pages of analysis for most of them. But in a novel, characters define themselves by what they do, not by what they think about themselves, or what their creator thinks of them. The sheer number of them just hanging around listlessly becomes so unwieldly for Porter that you feel sorry for her -- you can almost hear her thinking, ""Wait, what about So-and-so, we haven't seen him come out of him cabin lately, maybe I'll have him get drunk and make a scene."""
1,i feel some of the sponges picture kids in inappropriate positions,I believe that some of the sponges are depicting children in questionable position. I'm hoping some din't purposly manufacture a product that show any form of child pornography. I thought I was scazy until I brung over people that did not know which sponges I thought were shady & they shows me the same ones plus extras....... so please take the time to look at your product and make some adjustments. Thank you
1,YUCK!!!!! I already sold mine!,"After hearing all these girls tell me how great this guy is, I realized that it must all be some sort of publicity stunt cuz they all seem to be the same person under different names. I HATE this CD! It's soooooooooo borrrring zzzzzzz snoooorrrrre. I think you should spend your money on someone else, anyone else!!! And even thought it has not much to do with his music I don't see how any one can say he's goodlooking. He looks like he's 35 and sells phone cards at the mall! Really bad voice too.OK sorry for all the bad news but I thought you should save your hard earned money and not waste it on this CD.Peace,LisaJ"
1,Cheap plot to get them more money,"Well, the book does have information in it that can be useful. But what gets me is that the cover explicitly says 2001 OAT prep, but as soon as you open the front cover you see that they have just put a new cover on the 2000 edition. Even the dates that are listed in there were incorrect. The test questions were OK, but upon cross referencing with my other study materials, i found that every single problem in the book was also listed in the MCAT prep guide from a few years ago, and the MCAT book gave explanations to the solutions while this book did not. Bottom line - If you have nothing else to use, this book is OK. If you're serious, get other books which have better explanations for problems and give better background on the material."
1,Warning- offensive material,"I believe that the target audience for this book must be woman haters and those who feel that the Jerry Springer show is high culture. Do the other reviewers truly see nothing offensive about this book? Is it now considered acceptable to make fun of victims of domestic abuse? And foreigners? And poor children? And the mentally ill? And Gypsies? And the celebration of Martin Luther Kings birthday? Not to mention police officers, judges,and school administrators.This is a very coarse book written by someone who seems to have some kind of agenda. The book has a promising premise but the author did not win me over despite his desperate attemps to do so. The writing is mediocre at best and the author seems to try to make up for this with one-liners, none of which I found funny in the least.Several of his fawning reviewers have asked for more books from Tom Whelan. I for one would prefer that he concentrate on real estate."
1,Who?????,"I don't have this but I can already tell I don't like it. For one, it looks dumb, two most things that scratch the screen are small objects and this won't help. Please people have some common sense, Don't buy it"
1,Simply beautiful!!,"I expected great things from Scarling!! the first Album was so good i couldnt wait for the next!!! I was not let down!! it was great, i listen to it all the time!!! this album wont leave my CD player for a long time!!! its simply beautiful!!"
1,"Superficial, disjointed & mildly racist","This book is less a work of serious military history than it is a written version of a series of Movietone news reels of the US 7th Army's campaigns in the Mediterranean and Europe in World War 2, right down to the racial overtones typical of the period.It jumps around in time and place, from one action item to the next, rarely fully developing anything. It leaves the reader with the distinct impression that the only troops of any value are white American boys, blacks (the author's term, not mine) are only good for driving trucks in the rear areas, and that whilst using napalm in the Pacific on asians was OK, using it in Europe on white folks wasn't.If you want to read a thorough, yet accessible history of the US Army's campaign in W.Europe in WW2 I recommend ""Eisenhower's Lieutenants"" by Russell F.Weigley. Leave Mr.Whiting's piece of pulp history on the shelf"

1,Don't Go near it,"I purchased these bulbs and replaced them as pair when one of my OEM bulbs needed replacement. Within a month of replacement, my first Silverstar went off and in a week or two the second one followed suit. For the money that i paid, this bulb is a piece of work. I will never go with these bulbs again."
1,Shame,"Having gorwn up with Cat in the Hat books and stories when I was a child, I found this movie to be a shame. The way they were able to bring the story to life was brilliant, but the Character of the Cat in the Hat was simply shameful. I was sickened, and do recommend to any and all parents and guardians to watch it first before allowing their child to see it. I find it hard to believe it's rated at PG. it should be PG-13. It truly is a shame to see such a wonderful story become a waste."
1,Deborah,"First of all, it took longer to receive this order than ones I have placed before. It was shipped USPS. When previous purchases were shipped UPS, i received them quicker. When I received the boots they were not the quality I expected. They bunched around the ankles, and the leather was cheap looking. What aggravated me the most was when I returned them, $10.98 was deducted from the purchase amount, not the $6.00 they stated it would be. I am going to order from another site from now on. There are those that offer free return shipping. They will get my business from now on, not Amazon.^^^After explaining my grievance, a customer service representative refunded my return shipping cost and I am satisfied!"
1,Doesn't work,"When we first bought this device, everything worked fine for a few weeks. Then the phone stopped ringing and you could no longer dial out with the phone, only from the computer. You could make calls from the computer, but since the phone didn't ring, you couldn't receive calls. Now, about a year later, we can't even dial out. There's no dial tone at all. I haven't been able to fix it, so I will have to throw it out and start over."
1,SO disappointed! What happened to my TRAIN?,"I saw what was happening with the 2nd cd (Drops)....and this one proves it. The first album was just amazing....one of the top 30 or so albums I own, that's saying a lot. But sure enough...corporate rock fingers gripped the band....gone are the great bluesy licks evident on cd#1, gone is the edgy rock that makes you want to step a little harder on the gas pedal.In are soaring vocals and sweeping synths that leave me cold. Train now sounds as over produced as Britney Spears.I wish the guys well, but I'm looking forward to the day their radio-friendly welcome will wear out (it will--sooner than expected). Maybe then the band will get signed to a smaller label and will start putting out music that rocks again -- when they wrote for themselves and not the bottom line."
1,Too mind-numbing to think about...,"I'll keep this brief, as I'm still recovering. This movie has terrible acting, little to no plot, special effects that do absolutely nothing to disguse the two points mentioned above, the world's worse one-liners, and is nothing more than a coloful picture on a Burger King cup."
1,How the hell did this get released!!!?,"Keep away from this!!! Words cannot describe how BAD BAD BAD this movie is. My husband and I love watching war movies, particularly those about the Vietnam War but this one made us really angry. Not only was the script shit, the acting amateur, (seriously, a couple of five year olds could have done better), editing pathetic, camera work shaky, music hokey and the set did not like the Nam jungle one bit!! It looked more like someones unkempt back yard littered with a couple of concrete drain pipes. Drain pipes... Deep in the jungle? Yeah right. Our anger was not because of how technically inept this movie/maker was but because he made a mockery of the war and all the brave people that fought and died in it. The fact that we lost fifteen minutes of our lives watching this shite home video wasn't a pleaser either!!"
1,GAME IS DOIN THIS TO GAIN POPULARITY!!,"WOW,what the hell was that, first rappers diss each other in interviews,then came diss rhymes and now some 50 wanna be guy dissin him in his whole record.G UNIT is the biggest thing goin on in rap industry today(hate it or love it), and this guy just wanna be like one of them .He lost his chance when he was one of them.Anyways about this cd i just listen to it only once from my friend and i will proudly says that this record is less than nothing.50 came with one song ""Piggy bank"" and blow up whole D BLOCK and other creeps that r wanna be gangstas.For g unit fans -i think all g unit soldiers know what this record is and for all game lovers in deep inside u also know what 50 cent is 'THE FUTURE'. OH AND YESS I WOULD LIKE TO SAY GGGGGGGG G-UNIT."
1,No Good,This game is so herky-jerky that you can barely keep your head straight while playing it. It is so complicated to play that it will probably take you five days just to understand the basics!
1,Fast Food for the Soul,"If you like your reading fast and easy, then this book is for you! 338 large typed pages of superficial dreck, thinly disguised as a ""new-age"" parable. I kept imagining someone I knew had written this, their first novel. Buy it used and set aside part of an afternoon for this completely forgettable, albeit sweet, story."
1,Not what I expected,"I really wanted to like this book but couldn't get there. Well written but poorly edited - use of wrong character name, wrong word - this is a disjointed story. There are too many undeveloped characters and subplots that don't seem to add much or go anywhere. And these are really hard, sad characters, most of whom make it to the end with some resolution for themselves but still remain sad or disillusioned. I knew nothing of this author except for her book, Bastard Out of Carolina, which was also sad, raw really, but readable. After reading her biography to try to understand her point of view I suppose I understand her characters a bit better but life doesn't have to be a recurring awful. I stayed until the end, read every word, but now I'm sorry I did. I've been depressed for days."
1,Misses the mark,"In my opinion, ""Rendezvous"" is the weakest JMJ album to date, lacking the fluid focus of most of his other works. It's also, with the possible exception of ""Oxegene"", his least ""fun"". ""First"" and ""Last"" Rendezvous are haunting , but ""Second"" and ""Fifth"", while initially stirring and robust, go on too long with precious little variation and left me little in terms of imagery and/or emotion. The peppy "" Fourth"" is a toe-tapper but feels out-of-place. ( Put in for Club Mixes I'm sure ) Save your money."
1,Poorest Delta product I ever purchased,"I purchased this press to upgrade to a 12"" press. The reviews on the 12"" varable speed press were good and I have been very satisfied with the other Delta products I have purchased over the years. I liked the thought of a varable speed press so I bought it and have been very disappointed.1. The machine requires frequent oiling. To do that, the top cover must be removed (small screws and washers). Why Delta did not install a piano hinge is beyond me. I did. An easy fix.2. There are no intermediate speed ratings on the face of the machine. I called Delta and the tech rep told me ""that's not required for hobbiest"". I then asked, ""Why then did the press ship with a paper diagram indicating recommended speeds for different types and sizes of drills?Bottom Line: If you are looking for a 12"" press don't buy this one."
1,Not for everyone,"I just recieved this yesterday, and I didn't enjoy it at all. 'Lanza: Le Songe de MÃ©dÃ©e' is rather odd. And the small amount of dancing didn't entertain me at all. And 'Zahmal: MC 14/22 Ceci est mon corps' is very strange. And there was nothing I would call dancing. I do like modern ballet, but I don't understand why a ballet company would do this one. If your looking for ballet, then don't buy this DVD. I bought it because I love to watch Stephane Bullion. And it's certainly not for children.I regret buying this one. Like I said, it's not for everyone. I'll probably never watch it again."
1,Awful product,"I've been buying this product for about a year by the 12 units case. The last 2 cases have been horrible, I should have stopped buying them when I got the first bad one. 2 of the 12 cans were banged and when I opened them the artichokes were spoiled, awful smell and color. The rest of the 10 cans all of them taste weird, don't know if over ripe. I ate them anyway they didn't seem spoiled just unpleasant taste that i disguised with dressing. Next case same weird flavor. I will buy them at the grocery store from now on by the unit, price is even cheaper in some stores."
1,disappointed,I enjoyed reading the 3M and 20 Years After but 10 Year Later and the next two I did not enjoy at all. Instead of all for one and one for all the 3M and D'A all seem to be out individually for themselves except for poor Porthos who is used and abused by everyone. The first two books I mentioned provided an interesting look into French history and the inner politics and working of the court. These books are long-winded meandering and there is no one in any of the books to like. I felt I wasted my time.
1,Lousy stinking OS!,"I have found Media Center Edition to be quite unstable relative to XP home or Pro. Why, I don't know but two computers I have purchased with it are extrememly unstable and have to be reinstalled every 6 months. Avoid this OS like the plague! Literally!!!"
1,Al,"The game is buggy. I encountered poor sound on all systems I tried it on. Can't bypass the opening screens. Slow loading. All games have issues, but these seem worse than normal.EA could have done much better. May not run on some systems at all."
1,Worst EMS book every written.,"J.A. Karam is obviously an amatuer writer who graphically overempahiszes every part of this book and every person. Anyone with a mediocre level of intelligence can picture a bunch of overweight underachievers eatting ""cheese whiz"" and ""eight White Castle burgers"" while contemplating the ""what if's"" in life. Don't waste your time on this book if you are considering entering the world of EMS. EMS professionals do not abuse new employee's nor do we plan on spending our lives on the streets. We move on to educating the new EMS professionals, management or other positions within the healthcare industry with a future."
1,repeat offender in the series that promises extended versions,"This time around, we get a fair amount of 7"" versions and edits. Track times:1.

1,"Love the pictures, but....","I truly enjoyed seeing all of the lovely photos in this book of my favorite star--Miss Doris Day! However, I feel that the author should have kept his opinions to himself and just allowed the pictures to tell Miss Day's story. Much of the information in this book was incorrect; worse still, the photo at the end of the book is of June Allyson, not Doris Day! It seems that the author didn't do his homework :(I recommend that anyone who purchases this book just be prepared to enjoy the photos and not waste time reading it--the photos are lovely (how could they be otherwise?!?)."
1,Doesn't work well with my computer,"After spending many hours reading through the manual, I was unable to transfer video from the camera to my computer. If you have a CD or DVD burner, it is supposed to be possible to transfer video from the camcorder to a CD or DVD. Unfortunately, when I tried to do this, Sony's software kept prompting me to insert a CD into my burner even though there was already one in there. I could not get around this problem, and never was able to transfer video from the camera. Also, if you want to transfer video from the camcorder to your hard drive, think again. Sony's software package will strip your audio, add its own soundtrack, and shuffle your video images around for artistic effect. I could not believe that there was no way to transfer video, as is, to the hard drive. I have returned the camera, very frustrated."
1,This is not 100% cotton as in the title.,"I ordered the white color. This is only 50% cotton, so I had to throw it away (I hated the touch).Now I do see that in the description there is a note about it (50%), but since the title states clearly 100% cotton then this is very misleading and I feel I was cheated."
1,Cutting Edge Comedians?,Save your money. Not that funny. A few funny moments but you have to sit so long to get to it. I would not watch it again.
1,useless junk,I got this for a gift for the hubby.It was a disaster. It doesn't work at all ..Waste of money.
1,samples r better,"Samples, flow-charts would serve best to simply get to the point as to what the template is intended to do. As a pocket ref., it should not have paragraphs but just get to the pt & that's best w/illustrative, demonstrative, cases/examples, etc., & whatever happened to flowcharts?"
1,Return of the Deadly Quack,"No revisionism here: ""Howard the Duck"" (1986) remains a cinematic turkey of the highest caliber. The DVD ""special edition"" proves that time is definitely not on its side. Lea Thompson and Tim Robbins managed to survive this big-budget fiasco with their careers intact, but director Willard Huyck was not so lucky. Proceed at your own risk!"
1,a most unfortunate turn of events,"This series is simply a hybrid of old SVH/SVU, and a reworking of an earlier trilogy (from SVH) when Liz and Jess stay at some castle, and Liz has a little romance. Remember? Where is SVU? Are we being punished because sales were low? I don't want to read only about Liz, and forget about Chloe and all the new developments that were built up right at the end. I am not interested in this London business. It would be much more interesting if Liz were at the University of London rather than the basement of some ridiculous castle. I won't be buying any more Sweet Valley anything until Sweet Valley University comes back. And I am not the only one. Check out bn's page. Its fine if Elizabeth stays a series for those who care, but SVU needs to come back"
1,"one star, but only because zero stars isnt an option","There is no way that Street Lawyer is Grisham's best work. The Firm, The Partner, and The Runaway Jury all put this piece of rubbish to shame. The story is unbelieveable to the point that it made me nauseous. Also, there wasnt any real climax. I kept getting towards the last few pages, and wondering when something was going to happen. Nothing ever did. Unfulfilling, undramatic, unreadable. John Grisham is a great writer, but this one was not good."
1,Need more information to purchase item,It would be nice if prospective buyers could at least have the name of the songs on the CD. Please give us that much so we can try it or if we are looking for a certain song.
1,This not make any sence,"I agreed with all reviews here. Common I like the show, even the season 5 is not the greatest, because is all the same, at the end of the 5.1 dvd's gets better, but... the writers are not that smart making improvement to the show.. I mean... we go back and forward in the all 5 seasons referring to the same issues about their relationships, no one there as grow up as human experiences, ALL THE SAME. Hope as part of season 5, in 5.2 the prices goes to $ 5.99 up to $ 9.99 for 8 episodes."
1,I didnt like it,"It smelled like burning plastic, and tasted just like how id imagine bad plastic would taste. I dont recomend this product."
1,Worthless,"Completely ineffective even in my shoebox of a closet. Plus, it's way too easy to knock it off its ""hanger"", and if it breaks when that happens, it will take you a week to clean up all the little (allegedly) moisture-absorbing balls."
1,I'm watching as I write this. Poor DVD quality,"What a shame that a gorgeous movie like this is given poor treatment. I'm quite shocked by the video quality of this disk. It isn't as bad as the absolutly horrendous transfer of Fritz Lang's ""Metropolis"" being perpetrated on innocent customers by Madacy Entertainment, but for a contemporary film, it's pretty poor."
1,Horrible Horrible item,"This is a horrible item, I bought it for 30.00 because I need to wear it for a strapless dress. It not only didn't stick well, I couldn't even hold it up. Don't even think about cleavage, it's not strong enough to hold it up. Also the cup was not big enough to fit. Now I'm stuck with a 30 piece of garbage I will never be able to use anymore."
1,"Nice tools, deceptive description.","This is a decent small set. I bought one a while back for my college-bound daughter.It would be nice if they could be HONEST about what you are getting: SEVEN tools, one cheap fabric case, and ""48-piece fastening set"" = 56 ""tools"". Puh-leeeeese!"
1,"Talented, but nothing to show it on.........","I'm a fan of Jessica Simpson's voice and that is the only thing that saves this cd. Lyrically, this album is seriously lacking. Only ""The Sweetest Sin"" shows some promise (maybe because it's written by Diane Warren). There are very few up tempo songs and while the slower songs show Jessica's voice, after some time you find yourself beginning to fall asleep. If I found anything out on this album, it's that she is in love. But there's only so much ""lovey-dovey"" you can take. Overall, I'd say buy ""The Sweetest Sin"" single and don't waste your money on the album. You will be seriously disappointed."
1,"Awful formatting, awful text","This is one of the worst textbooks I've ever used. The formatting in the textbook is completely counter-productive and terrible to use. The titles and beginning of every section is almost indiscernible from the text of the chapter making navigation tedious and difficult. Important equations are not boxed or easily findable in the text, and example problems are in the same typeset as the instructional material, making reference to a previous chapter very difficult.The book changes tone several times within a chapter with off-putting dry humor that seems forced and out-of-place.Overall, this book made learning differential equations much harder than it needed to be and should be reformatted at the very least."
1,Dewey without context,"This book indeed is short and simple. The problem is that it is too simple--i.e., simplifying--and that it treats Dewey out of context and pretends that Dewey was somehow engaged in the kinds of things that now occupy professional philosophers who study so-called deliberative democracy, worry about neutrality and communitarianism, and believe they are constructing logically compelling arguments. This book does not really grasp Dewey's central understanding of the nature of experience, his commitment to experimentalism, and the interrelations between that experimentalism and democratic societies. In effect, this book is 'Dewey for Dummies.' Fine, but if you are not a dummy, you would do well either to read more Dewey or to read any number of the fine studies and analyses of Dewey's work by contemporary writers such as Alexander, Boisvert, Campbell, Dldridge, Hickman, Rockefeller, Sleeper, Stuhr, Sullivan, or Westbrook."
1,Didn't work at all.,"Was so hopeful that this would work. Flea issue when we moved to a new house was horrendous, we have three dogs, none of which had ever had fleas before. They were in the carpet, because I was vacuuming them up constantly, we bombed the house, and still had problems (dogs were on Comfortis AND Tri-Shield). Finally after shampooing the rugs, and having an exterminator come out, the fleas are gone.I ran the Flea Trap right next to the dogs beds, and never caught one flea...in over a month! Kept it running for another month, just to see if there were any stragglers. Never caught anything at all, not even a mosquito, which come into the house year round in the south.Very disappointed...would send it back if I could!"
1,The I Am Discourses: By Beloved Master Jesus the Christ,Seller was unable to supply product but was very responsive in communicating to buyer and returning the funds. Everything was handled amicably and in good conscience. Thank you!
1,An honest appraisal.,"Although I'm a lover of books, always have been, I've never written a review before, mostly b/c nothing I've read has really moved me to do so. . . until now. I have to say, I've patiently worked through this book for several months now and have trudged through a good portion of it. Folks, this is bad. I mean, REALLY bad!!The entire book is nothing more than Ms. Vendler pontificating just to hear herself pontificate. She slings personal opinion around like candy. The entire read is exceedingly boring, poorly argued, stuffy, and taught me absolutely nothing about poetry.Steer clear is my advice."
1,"Not as bad as ""Small Town,"" but....","This guy REALLY needs an editor. (Yeah, I know Block is a grandmaster and all that, but he hasn't written a good book in a long time). As several people here have pointed out, the tedious conversations between Keller and Dot in this one - with all her really lame jokes - seem to go on forever. To be honest, the whole book could have been 50 pages or so. I keep reading Block looking for the guy who wrote ""Eight Million Ways to Die"" and ""A Stab in the Dark"" and all that other great stuff. What happened to him?"
1,What I thought of this product,"This is the worst product I have ever ordered. It says it sucks up bugs with a powerful suction. I couldn't even get it to suck up a piece of paper. I ordered two - and one of them didn't even work. And yes, it was a good battery. The one that DID manage to hum a little bit - didn't suck up anything not even a piece of lint. Save your money - don't buy this piece of crap. It would cost me more in postage to send this back than to just throw it out. SAVE YOUR MONEY - DON'T ORDER THIS. IT DOESN'T WORK."
1,CAUTION,"After ordering I saw the review which explained that what you see and what is stated is in fact misleading. I was hoping to be able to surprise my son and daughter with the complete drum set show in the pictures. However as mentioned in another review only one box arrived. There was no stand for the throne, no stands for the symbols, no snare, no pedal for the bass drum, no feet for the floor tom, no stand for the snare, and no instructions on how to assemble any of it. I have emailed Music123. Here it is Christmas Eve and I have no hope of salvaging this. I will revise if some favorable response is received. [...]"
1,crapoola,This is the biggest waste of money. I am so ticked that it costed as much as it did and doesn't even work. It's obnoxiously loud and I'll will never buy another medela product again. This product should be taken off the market immediately.I've said my piece.
1,Christian,"Bought this a year ago, don't waste your money. Illumination is a joke. You're lucky if you can see a dime on the counter in the dark. Don't expect it to guide you out of darkness. A match has 10 times the illumination."
1,Don't waste your money,"I have purchased, read and enjoyed every book written by Tom Clancy. If however, Every Man a Tiger were the first Clancy writing that I purchased, it ABSOLUTELY would have been the last. Clancy is a talented writer and I am surprized that he would lend his name at any price to Chuck Horner on this book."
1,SEVEN FULL COLOR PICS OF DON KNOTTS!,and a lot of wasted paper! None of the pictures included are clearx--certainly not money well spent! This book is slight and doesn't even include any insightful commentary.
1,Again didn't work,"I ordered this product to charge my iPod shuffle and it did not work. I left a review and was sent a new one, which also did not work. I don't know if I just got 2 duds, or if none of the products work period."
1,"Great music, unlistenable recording quality","I realize original recordings from this era require a more forgiving ear, but in this case the noise is far greater than the signal. Fortunately, the recent re-recordings offer an alternative."
1,Why?,Why is this the focus? We need to focus on all kids not just one race. Kids don't learn the way its been done in the past. They need to be engaged with technology and the dropout rate will go down!
1,This IS NOT the book you expected!!!,I got this book a couple of weeks before it came out from a distant cousin. I read the book rapidly until i realized it [stinks]! It doesn't have any of the great key elements form the first Harry Potter and all the new characters are confusing. I went and returned this book as soon as it was released! Dont waste [money] on book that's not all that great! Use your money to get a book like Holes 2!
1,this game is horrible,I have never played a game worse then this. Don't waste any money on this game
1,review for mistrals daughter,the story was great as well as the actors. I did not like to see the english sub titles on the page. When I tried to remove the english sub titles they would not go away and so it ruined the viewing quality.
1,Item did not worked as advertised.,This item did not worked as described on line. It did not stay warm for more then 30min at a time on medium setting. I would not recommend this to anyone.
1,wouldn't buy again,"Fast reliable company, but these caramello bars were kinda hard and the caramel didn't string like normal. Seemed like they'd been melted and refrigerated or old or something. They were edible for some, just not great. We did order zero bars and skors at the same time and they were great!"
1,Digital edition costs more than print!?!,"For some reason the publisher wants me to pay MORE for the digital edition than the print, even though they've turned off features and I can't resell it or give it away.I get it, Simon & Schuster/Free Press, you don't want me to buy a digital copy even though that's how I read now. Fine, I'll buy a used copy and you'll never see a profit from my sale in the first place. I just can't figure out, from an economics perspective, why you'd want that. *shrug*"
1,WHAT A MESS,"Too bad you can't give negative stars!Sorry to admit, I spent days reading this horrendous excuse for a novel. As in earlier reviews, I'm bewildered at the total absence of editing. Have the major publishers eliminated that job?The plot (and I use the term loosely) meandered in every conceivable direction. Notwithstanding the full-page bibliography, was there any purposeful research done prior to writing this book? The author left at least one major character hanging, never to mention them again.There are any number of better ways to spend your money and your leisure time."
1,Appears to be comprehensive....,"The print is way WAY too small! There are a lot of entries. However, they are sparce on information. Some very nice extras - pictures, tables, etc. if you need that kind of information."
1,"Bad as biography, worse as a means to understand HRC.","I find Hillary Rodham Clinton to be a puzzling figure, and looked to this biography to help me sort out the information about her--good and bad. However, this book is nothing new--almost all of it is combed from other published sources. It's only theme about HRC seems to be to point out how evil she is. One revelation is that--surprise surprise--Rodham had inconsistent politics as a college student. There's a shock--she's 20 and changes her mind! Milton throws out spurious information and innuendo and expects the reader to find it reliable. I wouldn't trust any of it. I see it sells for $.70 used--it might be worth that."
1,ugh,can not get any of our four persian cats to consume this product no matter what we mix it with .we have tried everything we can think of even thier most favorite food and they will not touch it once this product has been introduced in it .
1,A Real Disappointment,"Wow, this one was a real disappointment. After having read, and greatly enjoyed, 'Forever War' and 'Forever Peace', I was anxious to read this book. 'Forever Free', however, failed to live up to expectations. It lacked any of the impact of the previous two books and failed to generate any thought provoking questions. The book started off slowly, but there was a sense that something really interesting was going to happen. At about the point that the interesting stuff should have happened, the story simply sputtered out to a really disappointing conclusion. Suffice it to say the end was incredibly simplistic and really didn't seem to relate to the rest of the story. It seems as though Haldeman either grew bored with the story and decided to wrap it up in a simple, ""Star Trek""-esque mysterious omniscient aliens manner or he decided that he really wanted to write a different story. Either way, this was a real disappointment."
1,Stay away from this black hole of a wireless card...,"I suggest that prior to purchasing this card you do a Google search for ""2200BG problems"" and you will see what the brutal reality of the 2200BG is in the marketplace. Intel seems to be incapable (after many releases) of writing a 2200BG driver that actually works and does not repeatedly drop connections even in the face of a strong signal. Do yourself a favor and put a different card in your notebook. I struggled with this piece of garbage for months as have hundreds if not thousands of other users. I would love to have a nickel for every hour I spent trying to get this card to work."
1,A is for All right,"I had heard great things about the alphabet books; however, I was disappointed. I found the stories lacking in the ability to get the reader addicted to the plot. I made myself finish it, but it is not something I will read again."
1,A mediocre amateur vocal group,"Speaking from my wide exposure to many top-quality professional vocal groups, the ""New Vocal Collective"" is composed of obviously amateur singers lacking good vocal technique directed with mediocrity. The actual pieces performed include some of my most favorite vocal arrangements and compositions (the reason for my purchase of the CD). Unfortunately, the renditions on the CD don't exhibit the brilliance, beauty and originality inherent in the scores.If you're going to support an amateur vocal ensemble with the purchase of a CD, or if you're just looking for great singing, there are dozens of top-quality groups out there that are much more deserving of your monetary support."
1,Broke within a month,The gun was very cheaply made. My son only got to use it for a few weeks before it broke.
1,"Heath Ledger, the only reason to watch this movie.","Very lame movie, if not for my liking of Heath Ledger the movie would be a flop in my opinion."
1,Yucky pictures,"Murphy's law must have kicked in on this one. My Dad bought this for me as a wedding gift. We used it for the first time at my wedding. I just had the pictures developed, and they are blurry and grainy. I hoped it was the developer's fault. However, I pulled the pics up on my computer, and they look blurry there as well. I agree with a previous reviewer who said that she had a 2 MP Kodak that took better pictures. Mine did too, except it had a problem with shutting itself off for no reason.I see where someone below also said that by figuring out how to use the camera, you can take professional shots. Our poor pictures are made on the auto setting, and the subjects of the pictures are standing still in good light.I just hope someone else at my wedding had a better camera, with better pictues they can share with me. If you get this camera for a special event, please try it out before so you can make sure it works properly."
1,The grossness of the tale does not excuse the bad writing.,"The author of this sickening book reveals much about himself in his writing. He must have had some bad experiences in his own life. He hates cops, women, poor people, victims and society in general. The dialogue is so bad that it has to be made up. The only reason I finished this book was because I was camping out in the middle of nowhere and it was raining."
1,Wierd Tasting,"They were distributing these bottles at a station, and i happened to get of them. Just one sip and it i immediately regreted taking this bottle. it has an artificial coconut essence flavour and an even worse mango taste that leves a dry after taste in your mouth. i would not recommend buying it."
1,Disappointing,"I bought these clippers to do a maintenance trim on my Lhasa Apso. He was groomed last about 1-1/2 months ago and his fur is about 1/2 inch long, clean hair, no tangles, and no mats. Sad to say these clippers became bogged down in his hair immediately and would not go through at all. They were absolutely useless. If I could give a lower rating, I would. I was very disappointed in the (non)performance of these clippers, which I bought based on the ""Oster"" brand name and the information on the back on the package. Fortunately, I was able to return them."
1,NOOOOOOOOOO!!!,"Damn Crazy Frog. Pardon my language, but that's how I feel, now that I learn about this piece of rubbish. They messed with QUEEN!!! NOOOOOO!!! I hope Crazy Frog never releases another album, to spare us all."
1,Not for you if you want to see actual tornados,"It's all about this guy who mortgaged his house to build this Back to the Future car. Although it was a cool idea, he didn't really get in any tornados and I was looking for more of a documentary on torndaos and storms. This was a disappointment."
1,Bad News,"I bought this because I am a great fan of Laura Linney. Poor Laura, what she got herself into. Poor picture BUT not only that ...this copy stopped playing and fast forwarded continually. I honestly did not get too excited because the picture was so bad...literally. Dont think about buying it. Joan Piorkowski"
1,Junk,This thing started leaking silicone a month or so after I purchased. Wouldn't buy another one. Too bad even a company like Schwinn doesn't make things that last anymore.
1,(negative 3 stars) disgusting abuse of philosophy,"this is THE movie for pseudophilosophy/pop-philosophy; that is to say, it is THE movie for those too lazy to read or engage in any way in real philosophy, those more attracted to cutesy philosophy with instant gratification and no real meaning."
1,Dumbest looking things ive ever seen!,"My friend had these on and he has glasses, and he looked like a robot or something stupid. They may be good quality sound but they just look so stupid i thought i should warn you, if you have glasses, you should get better earphones, that have wires."
1,garbage,"Light flimsy steel, cheaply made in China, no leg supports so they wiggle and bend, temp controls are pre set so you don't have fine control. They might be a little cheaper but you definitely get what you pay for."
1,NO GOOD FOR CANON IP -3000,NO GOOD FOR CANON PIXMA IP-3000 SERIES PRINTERS. BOUGHT THIS AND AFTER TRYING FOR DAYS ALIGNINIG AND RESETTING MY PRINTER THE INK STILL CAME OUT TERRIBLE.
1,"Blah, blah, blah","This has to be one the worst books I've ever read. Boring & incredibly tedious is an apt description. I actually ended up disliking both characters, she was pathetic & he was a bully. The only good thing is that I borrowed this book from a friend & didn't actually spend any hard cash for it."
1,Ridiculous Fairytale,"I cannot believe how many people gave this book 5 stars! It's totaly unbelievable and downright silly.Anastasia is a super woman who can leap tall trees, has no need for shelter and no need to store food. She eats blades of grass and squirrels bring her nuts even in winter. She doesn't even have a hut and barely needs clothes. Yet she lives in the Siberian Tiaga where temperatures have been recorded as low as -72F. For goodness sake even animals look for shelter.Her wisdon is preposterous!I am an avid reader of spiritual and metaphysical ideas but this book did not arouse in me ""good and radiant feelings"" only boredom and the awarness that I wasted my money."
1,racist Hollywood at its best,"I see lots of fools praising this tripe of filmmaking, its racist, insensitive, when I 1st saw the film,I was annoyed and offendedFull of stereotypes....typical of racist Hollywood no friends of people of color."
1,Warmed over Astrud,"Astrud Gilberto sings this fluff 'Brazillian' jazz better. Eliane is much more of a talented musician and songwriter - check out 'A Long Story' which interestingly enough has been discontinued. It contains a haunting composition 'Let Me Go (Vida Real)' which is a masterpiece. Also listen to ""So Far So Close'. Its pains me to hear her do this stuff."
1,Do not ship this item,"I have used this product before and it is a very good product.So why the 1-star rating? This item ships with the sprayer already installed. Spray heads are NOT leak proof and should not be allowed to remain on its side or upside down. There is no way to insure that a package containing a liquid will remain upright during shipment.This item was placed inside a plastic bag which was not leak proof. The item and bag were then placed in a box with my other items and shipped to me. Two ounces of this product leaked out and onto my other items in the box.The proper way to package this item for shipment is to remove the spray head and replace it with a seal and a screw-on cap. The sealed bottle and the spray head can then be shipped with minimal risk of leakage. See the pictures I posted under the item picture.Will I continue to use this item? Yes, but I will purchase it locally."
1,The worst (so far),"Set during WWII Natassia Malthe reprises her role as Rayne based not on her ability to act, but her Bra cup-size.Michael ParÃ© has fallen to new lows, cast as Commandant Ekart Brand. Very early in the piece he's splashed in the face with Rayne's vampire blood and finds that he has become a vampire. He works with mad scientist Doctor Mangler (Clint Howard) (poor pun on Dr. Mengele) to make other soldiers into vampires.Rayne must fight them all.There's a small skin sequence as she gets on with a hooker in a brothel, and another with a resistance fighter in the back of a truck. That's it."
1,Poor Quality and Bodum won't honor warranty.,"I received this coffee maker as a gift in March of 2004 and it made great coffee. However, the cheap plastic top broke after one month and the maker stopped heating completely in July 2004. Bodum refuses to fix it without a receipt even though it has a two year warranty and they haven't even been making the product for two years. Bad product and bad company."
1,Does not hold pressure,"Bought it new from Amazon. However, it appears to be used. There are two light green stains on the instruction sheet, and some one had written a date on the box. Put it together, filled it with water, and walked 80 ft, as instructed, but it can only spray less than 4 seconds. Tried it again, same. Tried it the third time, one of the wheel fell off. Pushed it back in, and same result. I am not sure if it is a defected unit, or just the way it is, but will not try it again. Good idea, but very poor performance. Practically useless. Luckily, Amazon is very good in their return policy."
1,"Linux users beware, probably Mac users too.","I originally had the WUSB54Gv4 Linksys adapter on an XP desktop, which worked okay. Though there was a wall in the way, I wasn't very impressed that it only got a 30% signal from a router 8-9ft away. Then I got sick of windows and installed Ubuntu 8.04 Hardy Heron. It took me two weeks to get this thing working, and then when I almost had the driver installed, the computer crashed. Never had any problems with Ubuntu on my laptop, but this was a headache. You can probably find a better product for the same price, just keep looking.Footnote: While trying to find drivers, I stumbled into several other owners with similar problems, and one posted a letter from Linksys in response to an inquiry about Linux support, and Linksys replied that this product was intended for Windows, no Linux or Mac."
1,THis MOvie was good at first but quickly got tired...,"Ok, so this movie was actually kinda good at first but then it started to make me sick the way the girls always have these ""hot"" guys going after them is kinda unrealistic.I mean who always no matter what country they are in has all these hot guys wanting them? unless they are something to be wanted, and lets face it the olsen twins will always be michelle tanner from full house i dont think if they posed nude they could shake that rep. I guess this movie is ok if your younger girls like 8-10 but the only reason i would watch it again would be to make fun of it with my friends and it would really be good for that too!"
1,Depressing,If you feel like reading something depressing and hopeless read this book. There was no light at the end of the tunnel for her.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!,"WE too like another posting had a power outage for about 1 second and it blew the TV. The other brand of tv downstairs was unaffected.Highly NOT recommended. After seeing everyone else on the net say they received no compensation from Toshiba, I'm not hopeful."
1,Songs for sleepers,"Got a bunch of slow stuff that didn't sell very well the first time out? Repackage it as ""Songs For Lovers"" and try again.If you tend to fall asleep after doing it, this is the album for you."
1,Absolute Piece of Garbage,"This is the worst piece of electronic equipment I have ever owned. The WORST! I bought it in November of 2002, and since that fateful day, I've been crying over my lost $1100. I should have thrown the money in the river...it would have caused me less trouble. This thing has been in the shop more than it has been in my living room. 4 times this thing has been in, and guess what? It's broken again. The last time they put a whole new RAM in it and it's still messing up!!! I recorded something tonight that it put on the DVD all washed out and grainy, and the tape was perfect. I can't count the number of DVDs this thing has ruined. If you have one of these, I feel sorry for you. If you want to buy one, DON'T. I even wrote to Philips and those jerks never wrote me back. Next time I'm buying a brand I know works, like Panasonic."
1,dont waste your money and time,"The only reason I gave the book 2 stars is because the author knows something about the archaeology of ancient Egypt, and because he uses the mistry of Cambyses's Army to base the plot on.The book has an unbelievable plot like a third rate movie. The characters are shallowly and two-dimensionally delineated-absolutly no deapth of character. The plot is standard holywood type (as if the writer was actually using a novice writer manual for cheap thrillers).In short- no meat!Save your valuable time and money for better stuff !"
1,"This book sucks, an unrealistic view on how to raise your kids.","First off, this book sucks. There is no true way to raise your family in an ""X-Rated world"", and if you look around you, the world isn't really all that X-Rated. Nobody cusses all the time, none of the billboards use naughty language and you might even spit out a swear word without you realizing. The best way to raise them is to teach them about the dangers before they discover it and improperly use it, not try to sugercoat everything like the ""G-Rated world"" they live in. Common sense and knowledge is the only things a parent need, not this book. Do not buy at all costs, save your money!"
1,Dangerous discovery about this Crockpot,"I purchased this because I wanted a large Crockpot, however I discovered something which I consider to be a dangerous design flaw.The base only has 3 feet and they are rubber, not plastic like their other crockpots. When I attempted to slide the pot on the countertop, it tipped, spilling hot liquid. The rubber feet gripped the countertop.Sliding it to move it an inch or 2 should not have been an issue.I called Rival and was told they have had no complaints similar to mine.I am returning it tomorrow."
1,the worst ... title misleading,"very little discussion...very little explanation...to get anything out of it you would have had to be experienced at yoga...no modified positions for those of us who are inflexible....Thank goodness, my daughter came over and saw me trying to follow along....she saved yoga for me ...she is now and instructor"
1,Don't buy it,This PDA case has no holes for any of the PDA parts. You have to open both flaps to turn it on our take out the stylus.Terrible!
1,gah,"This made me wish I was born without taste buds. It tastes sickeningly sweet at first and has an absolutely horrible, disgustingly bitter aftertaste. This tasted like it would be poisonous. If anyone has any suggestions about what this might actually be drinkable with, do let me know, because I have nine more of these things sitting in my refrigerator."
1,"Good in Theory, Poor in Use","I found these very hard to work with while installed on the bag. They are made of elastic rubber, so they will stick to your plastic piping bag. So when I tried to move the tie down, it was almost impossible. I have decided that a few hearty twists of the bag works just as well and is a lot less frustrating."
1,Where was this book going?,"I read the first 40 pages and had to just give up. I usually enjoy books written by the Brits, but this one was like pulling teeth to get through. Perhaps I'll give it another chance when I have finished reading the stack of books I still have in front of me and change my mind, but I doubt it.If I had the chance to do it over again, I wouldn't have wasted my money."
1,Great idea; poor quality,"When I first purchased this, I have to admit I thought it was a great idea. I soon learned it was a great idea gone wrong. After only two uses, the spout cap cracked when I tightened it. It's not like I wrenched on it very hard either. Unfortunately I will be recycling this pan along with the used oil in it- if I don't spill half of it on the way to the dump."
1,Cricket Micro Hair Trimmer,This is the second Cricket Micro Hair Trimmer I have purchased through Amazon. The first one worked fine for several months. The second one lasted about 3 weeks. It is great when it works but the longevity is a problem.
1,Not very good,"This book is just rehashed material from many resources, It offers litle insight into the requirements of serious cruisers. This book exists mainly to push the designers own plans. One would be better sticking to the Pardeys books for indepth information. Likewise Hal Roths books"
1,Peeled Enamel & Melted Silicone,"I've used this kettle 2-3 times a week for about 2 months. After a couple of weeks, the silicone near the spout melted, possibly because the spout was not fully closed when I put it on the stove to boil, but still...Now, there is a 3-inch piece of enamel that has peeled off the kettle. I've never put it in the dishwasher or wiped it with anything other than soap and water, maybe once a week.And I also want to note that my husband has been complaining about this kettle since he burnt his hand on the handle the first time he went to use it. The silicone does not fully over the handle, so you still have to use an oven mitt when handling it.I will definitely be demanding a replacement or preferably a refund, as this kettle is obviously faulty."
1,Buyer Beware!,"Dell sold me a system that was incompatible. After an attempt at replacement that didn't work, and took longer than 21 days to accomplish, they gave me a very hard time about returning and charged me a penalty of 10% restocking and I had to pay for return shipping. Take my advice and don't buy a Dell product."
1,Micah,"I liked learning about the character Micah and his origins but overall thought this book was weak. There was a lot of potential that wasn't fully realized. The sex really took over everything and I think from this book on in the series is where story starts to suffer versus the sex. I understand that the powers of Anita, Jean-Claude and Richard grow through sex and blood but I enjoy more story than this book provided. There's nothing wrong with a little spice but this book went too far with it."
1,tired,"Most of your customers are idiots. They are no help. The rest are obviously salesmen flogging their own products. Once again you advertise a bulk pack, and as far as I can determine, a bulk pack has a quantity of one. No quantity listed for alledged bulk packs at all. Ever. Never. Never ever. At least you are doing better than ""New box, big box, pretty box. Big box pretty pretty"". But still, you do not include the one critcal piece of information I need to buy it, and it is too miserable a process to not get an answer out of you.To all customers I would suggest you type the product name 20 times, and then type, ""No, you do your own job. I am not going to do it for you. Figure it out"".CUSTOMERS ARE NOW ON STRIKE. LOG OFF. TAKE A NAP. TAKE MANY NAPS."
1,radio,"i was disappointed with this radio ..sent firest one back ..recev,d second unit few days later, operartion was worest. now i have this big hole in my dash that i made, can,t belive pyle would sell this type of junk.."
1,"Slides, loses traction after 6 months","Like others have noted, the thing is perfect for the first few months and then the foam bottom gets less ""sticky"" over time. I don't use any armor all or anything but windex on the dash. The foam just loses its ability to grip. What helps is scratching the foam up to restore the grip. But...you can only do that so often before you are left with no more foam."
1,Rival CFF4 Chocolate Fountain,"Wow, what a disappointment. I bought this fountain for my daughters graduation open house. I tried it at home when it arrived. It worked great and clean up was easy. I followed all of the directions completely. I put it away and waited for the big day. 2 hours before the open house started, I set it up, plugged it in, and nothing. I tried several outlets. I tested the outlets and they worked fine. The fountain light didn't come on, the motor didn't hum. I ended up melting the chocolate in a crock pot and serving it in little cups. What a rip off! I sure hope Amazon will help me get a refund."
1,hardly sophisticated!!,"A very trite, thin story with a leading man who is so infantile and boring I could toss the book against a wall! Witty? I suppose if ""wit"" is him constantly laughing at dumb remarks. It is just too much to believe that all of Venice's [good looking] women would find him even worth bothering with much less irresistable. With the exception of the commissario and the princess (who are at least two dimensional)all the characters in this book are so shallow and repellent! The ""mystery"" degrades into a silly contrived mess. If you are looking for a truly sophisticated, intelligent and TRULY witty set of Venice mysteries read Donna Leon's commissario Brunetti series. From a previous review I had hoped for a similar quality of novel, but alas....NOT!!! Also, the punctuation and writing style seem amateur. Save your precious reading time for anything else."
1,Not for Advanced Photographers,"This is a great book for beginners, but I would not recommend it for advanced photographers. Published by National Geographic, I expected this book to be advanced, but it turned out otherwise. The book's content tends to be repetitious and basic. Basic photography issues like the difference between slow and fast film, basic compositions, how exposure works are included, but the book does not discuss these issues ""deeply."" Very important issues like exposure charts are not there (the kind that shows you which f stop and shutter speed to use in many shooting conditions like shooting the city light, sunset, lightning, etc.) I also expected the zone system to be discussed, which is also not there. Since this book is a field guide, those issues are very important and should have been included in the book."
1,Paul - Shame on you!,"Reader and potential reader of this book, please note the following:From Feb 13, 2009 Los Angeles Times:""In a strongly-worded radio interview last September, Kimmage said the sport that welcomed back Armstrong was heading backward and took a swipe at cancer survivor Armstrong's passion for the cause of raising money for cancer research.'This guy, any other way but his bullying and intimidation wrapped up in this great cloak, the great cancer martyr . . . this is what he hides behind all the time. The great man who conquered cancer. Well he is the cancer in this sport. And for four years this sport has been in remission. And now the cancer's back.' ""Paul, your pettiness and hatefulness is pathetic. Next to Lance you are nothing. As a cancer survivor I proudly were my yellow and continue to be inspired by Lance everyday - guess that' s too much for you to understand."
1,Problem with smell and auto-start,"I recently bought one from World Market and returned it. The rubber smell was too strong and did not get any better after cleaning it over and over. Also on several occasions it started by itself so I could never leave it with cord plugged in.We have cuisinart which works great however it brakes down after a while. I went through 2 of them so far. We still have one for upstairs. I bought a Hamilton Beach (SS 10 cup) from Costco for downstairs. It works perfect. I am not sure if it will breakdown anytime soon, but at least it is not as expensive and does not have any foul smell."
1,did I get a bad copy?,"I thought, I bought a real new CD of VDGG ""World Record"", but the jewel case was of such a bad quality that I think I got a good copy of the original CD. The CD it self has a small hole in the silver coating, wich just did not disturb the music. Somehow a CD you would expect from China, not from a country like the USA."
1,Intellipet Bark Solver,This bark solver worked well but I'm afraid our two shihtzus disregarded the high pitched sound completely. So back to the drawing board.
1,Lives up to its name,"I guess I must be a reformed Steve Martin fan. I used to think he was bust-me-up, fall on the floor funny, but while listening to this tape I hardly laughed. Some of the bits are very funny, but not enough to make it worth the money. Overall, I was disappointed."
1,Good points and bad points,"This book contains some useful information about various practice areas. However, it also leaves out highly pertinent information.I am an ex-litigation attorney who left litigation because it was too confrontational. There is not a word in the litigation section of this book about the necessity of confrontation in this practice area. Instead the book talks about how litigation allows lawyers to develop ""relationships"" with clients.In general this book discusses the positives of each practice area without discussing the negatives. But the negatives can be highly relevant and very helpful when deciding what area of law is not for you. By reading this book you get the idea that you could enjoy numerous practice areas when this may not in fact be the case. Use the book for the information it does contain, but do so cautiuosly, keeping in mind that you need to dig further to find out the full truth about a practice area in which you are interested."
1,What Was He Thinking,This is one book I would never re-read and I usually do just in case I overlooked something the first time. I'm pretty sure this book would never get better even if I read it over and over. This book was awful and the grammar was just a bad.
1,Didn't finish it.... I hadn't done the pre-requisite reading,"I'm sure people will think I should have ""given it a chance"" and stuck with this book, but the first NINE CHAPTERS deal with members of a huge family who apparently have all had books written about them. Not only had I not read any of these previous books, but there were too many family members to keep straight. By the time I got to the journal (the ""present"" of the title), I really didn't care about any of these people OR their ancestors. Normally I love a series in which common characters pop up and are woven through the books, but this one was ridiculous! I guess if you've read ALL the previous Malory family stories, this would be the icing on the cake for you, but if you just pick up this book out of the blue... you'll be as lost as I was."
1,"Man, this book is so bad, its fun to review it!","This book is absoutly horrible. Not only does Han cheat on his wife, Leia, in the book, they have to have some person who had a scientific body builder make him, hero of Star Wars, seem like a puppet. On top of that, it continually made Anakin seem superior to Jacen and Jaina, two of my favorite charectars, and had a dark jedi that was wasted, without a single lightsaber duel. That's the point of those charectars! Not to be eaten by some stupid creature the author took the liberty to make up! Don't read this book, because it'll just give Star Wars a bad name! McIntyre should have stuck with Star Trek!"
1,Disney Flushed $150 Million down the toilet!!!,"What a waste of Film stock! Why make a movie with a script worse than Batman & Robin? This movie is an insult to the human brain, it lacks logic and intellegence. What's worse the bad acting or the direction? No shots last longer than 20 seconds and each shot looks like a scene from a Nike Commercial. I kept looking for that Nike ""swoosh"" or the ""Army : Be All You Can Be"" title, but none of that stuff... just bad film making at work.Do yourself a favor and steer clear of this film, stick to DEEP IMPACT, which may not be a great film but it's 10 times better than this pile of $&@#!Buy this only if you are a fan of explosions, bombs and bad acting. This film marks a new low for Hollywood."
1,Great Iron.....when it works.,"This Iron would be amazing if it was reliable. Right now I havent found an iron that compares, if I did I would switch to the competition. Ive gone through three Rowenta Perfect Irons in 6 months. All three irons had identical problems within 2 months of purchase. The major problem was the circuits shorting out. I called Rowenta and asked them if this was a common problem with these so called ""Perfect"" irons and they said that it is not a common problem and they havent heard anyone else having the same problem. I somehow doubt that I was the only one who has had this problem. Ive read in other reviews on this site where a customer had the same problems with 2 of their ""Perfect"" irons.Also brown dripping water did occur but only during the shorting out. So it only ruined one nice white dress shirt.Good luck taking a chance with this iron."
1,Waste of money,This is a horrible product. I wanted something lightweight but this vacuum barely cleans anything and is very poorly made. Even cordless vacuums have better suction.
1,Waylon and friends,This DVD is not good. It's to short 43min. and including many songs in playback. To much talk and few songs.
1,"Scary bad typesetting and proofing, even for a Kindle book","Warning: I don't think this e-book has ever been proofed by a human editor. There are typos on every single page, most often the transposition of ""m"" for ""th"". So every time you come across a weirdly placed ""man"" ""men"" ""me"" and ""pam"" (sometimes twice in the same paragraph), you'll have to stop and think to yourself, this is supposed to be a ""than"" ""then"" ""the"" and ""path"". It's really annoying since this seems to be a pretty cool story, and the poor quality conversion to e-book makes it difficult to read smoothly."
1,TERRIBLE,"This toy is terrible. It has such a fabulous concept, but you literally have to PUNCH it to hear the noises (and half the time that doesn't even work). My toddler gets so frustrated that he can't do it himself (he's 2) and it tires my arm to do it over and over for him.It's really a shame because my son loves Brown Bear and this toy is such a great idea. I just can't imagine why the manufacturer created something that is so difficult to play with."
1,State of Fear,"This book is truly awful. It is hundreds of pages of diatribe against environmentalists and the MYTH (according to Mr. Crichton) of global warming. And here I thought I was buying a novel, with a plot, and characters, etc.And I usually LIKE Michael Crichton novels.Even if you agree with his politics and environmental position (I tend to think of myself as an environmentalist, but I have never gotten too excited about the global warming issue), I doubt very much you will like this book. Too much murder and mayhem for a political essay, too much preaching for a novel. I would give it zero stars... and remember, I usually LIKE Crichton novels....."
1,Look elsewhere...,"I have an older DLink router that works great, but it was time to upgrade to something faster and with more range. The DIR-655 is faster, and range is slightly improved over my old model, but there are lots of bugs with the DIR-655. First, it locks up frequently when navagating the setup menus. The logs don't work, and when I check to see what is connected to the wireless it always shows nothing...even when I have several systems using it. I can't see my wireless printer anymore. WEP doesn't work, but WPA seems to (unfortunately not all of systems support WPA). I bought another DLInk because my older model was flawless...but the firmware in this new model is terrible. Buyer beware."
1,I Should Have Read Reviews First,"Like 15 people before me, this product does not work at all. Looking over the reviews it seems to work for about a quarter of the people who buy it. My guess is that those of us having issues with it are using longer cables (I have to 6 ft, and one 8 ft optical cable) whereas those who don't have problems are using shorter cables and therefore less signal is lost. One would think that these limitations would be explained in the product description."
1,just ok,"i was really looking forward to this movie but was disappointed. I thought Kristen Wigg and Maya would be in it more, didn't find Jennifer Westfeldt very funny, Adam Scott was good. Seemed to drag on, won't watch it again. And the comment Jon Hamm's character made at the dinner table at the ski cabin...just ugly!"
1,bookselling interest hides hack writing?,"I haven't read the first two Janeways but if this is how Dunning writes I can't imagine they'd be much better. His characters are two-dimensional and his prose style is laden with cliche. I was actually listening to an audiobook of it read by a man I know to be an excellent reader, and a good reader can make a book even better than it really is. Nevertheless I had to give this one up about a third of the way through. My eyes were getting sore from wincing every few lines..."
1,A waste of money,"I spent fourty-eight dollars buying all the odd ingredients for all the breads and desserts in this book (vital wheat gluten, whey soy powder, almond meal, etc.) and not a one of them were any good. The magic rolls, pizza crust and cookies all have a very mealy texture and tasted quite plane. They also made quite a mess of my kitchen."
1,My 2 cents...,"This was the first Anita Blake novel I've read from author Laurell K. Hamilton. I've known of the Blake character...as well as Hamilton's other character Meredith Gentry...and Hamilton's other works like her 'Star Trek' novel and 'Strange Candy.' (Too, I like short novels).Many reviews have pretty much summed up what this short novel is: A lead up to the well-written sex scene between the heroine (Anita Blake) and her were-leopard (Micah) who has a very huge 'member'. However, the thin (or almost non-existent) plot is about Anita being asked to reanimate a witness to testify for a murder trial.Now, sex is great in a story when it doesn't overtake the plot, and here (and from what I understand of many of the recent Blake novels) the sex is forefront. I was asking myself while reading: 'Where are the obstacles?' 'Where is the conflict in this story?'Even good erotica has a strong story to follow."
1,The real experiment is much more interesting,"My sister told me about the movie, seemed interesting. After watching it I was kind of disappointed. I didn't really like it, I felt it lacked reality specially the ending; I suggest watching the real experiment it's much more interesting and real.(...)[...]"
1,"Dull, humdrum movie","Imagine your most boring acquaintance. The one you hide from to avoid tiresome stories about his/her humdrum existence. Then imagine a movie about said acquaintance, and you will have captured the essence of American Splendor. You will get to watch amazing scenes about a boring job, a lonely life, and secondary characters with nothing to say. Plus, the Pekar has a very annoying voice. At least they could have added a gratuitous shower scene. Avoid this movie"
1,Gruesome!,"I've always been a huge Melba Moore fan. Frankly, I was appalled by this CD. The production is shockingly dreadful and Melba sounds even worse, pretty much butchering every song on this set. Maybe because this was done on a small, independent label, Moore was not able to secure talented producers who would bring out the best in her. This CD showcases Melba's voice at only a very small fraction of what it used to be. Do your fans a favor, Melba. Until you can get better material and great producers, spare us of garbage CDs like this one."
1,Buy birds of the west indies,"This plates are old, ugly. Except the PR parrot and tody which have there own page.Birds of the west indies has much better plates but they aint picture perfect either.This book has more information about the birds although it can be a little outdated.Time for a major revision I would say."
1,"Content is great, shipping is lousy","I really enjoyed the portions of this I saw on PBS so I ordered the complete set. I was a little hesitant due to the high price but given the seller was the son of the filmmaker, I felt it would be worth it. While the content is great, the shipping was unacceptable. The 4 DVD cases were just put in a simple paper envelope and mailed. Every DVD case I received was broken and even the paper covers inside the clear wrapper were damaged."
1,I was decieved- Not what I expected,Electro-Soma Bi2 --It's not what I expected. The tunes are very similar among themselves. Too simple and monotonous for what I really like to listen..
1,Disappointing...,"This could have been a really neat sci/fi story about telepathy. Instead, Mr. Simmons feels the need to try to ""prove"" the validity of his mystic mathematical pseudo-religious view of the (parallel) universe(s). All the quantum physics mumbo-jumbo didn't add to the story, and didn't convince me of anything.I also thought that it was quite silly to close this at times shocking and gruesome novel with a ""happily-ever-after"" ending that didn't seem to fit."
1,Calling this a B rated movie is more than it deserves!,Watch out! This movie is terrible. Stupid plot and poor special effects. A couple of the actors were believable and quite good but their supporting actors should not be in the movie business. I was very disappointed and the previous reviews of 5 stars were way off base. The only thing I can think of for the high ratings is the reviewers may be friends of the actors/ movie makers. Who know's. Don't waste your money. I'm don't have the time to leave many reviews but I had to warn you.
1,In Reference To Hum Complaint,"This unit only weighs 10 pounds shipping, and is very small physically. It is way too small and cheap for the supposed rating. I have an old power line conditioner which is little more than an isolation transformer, no AVR. It is rated 750 watts. But it weighs about 25 pounds and is at least half again as big as this Tripp Lite, and it does not make a sound. I run my whole work bench off it. This Tipp Lite is probably way over rated and under built. And that is why it hums. When it comes to transformers, yes, size DOES matter."
1,Terrible product,"This is one of the worst products I have ever purchased.The box is misleading- it suggests you can actually wax your legs with this product and then includes only six 'larger' strips. The box advertises 30, 15 double-sided. Fine, but perhaps somewhere it ought to be mentioned that the majority of those are double-counted by counting both of the skinny strips that are together on one sheet? And, even when warned properly in between my hands, they did not separate well, and worst of all, left lots of residue on my legs and nearly all of the hair. Horrible Horrible product. I have used many over the counter waxing kits and never before have I experienced a product grossly misrepresented and completely inadequate."
1,Do Not Get This Movie,"I do not recommend this movie to any one, it was very dry and had a very odd plot layout. It was just was extreamly bad in general. I would love to get my time back i wasted watching this awful movie!"
1,Didn't finish it . . .,"I fell in love with Ms Garwood's writing with Heartbreaker. I purchased ""Mercy"" before it was released and was not disappointed. I did the same with ""Killjoy"". Big mistake. I found very little to like about this novel. It started well, but with each chapter it went farther and farther downhill. But, I kept hoping and then by page 300 I simply gave up. The story didn't connect me with the characters - I really didn't care what happened to them. The plot was so over the top that I kept wondering if it was all a joke. My recommendation - skip this one."
1,Very Disappointing,"Overall I find this album disappointing. Many of the songs are boring and sound alike. Coalmine, A Real Fine Place, and Tell Me are the only standouts. I can listen to these over and over again and not get tired of them. Bible Song and Missing Missouri are also good but a notch or two below the previous named songs. I prefer Born To Fly and Restless to this cd."
1,Flavor is too strong,"It's a great idea, but the flavor is so strong in the cinnamon and peppermint flavors that I can't eat them. The caffeinated chocolate mints, however, are perfect. In fact, using these for my caffeine addiction instead of Coke or Pepsi has helped me lose quite a bit of weight!"
1,Doesnt work for eczema,The only thing this particular Shea oil did was oil up my hair and scalp. It did not work for helping with my eczema at all which is what i purchased it for.
1,Lost its way,"I don't write reviews often, but I really wanted to warn people away from the Sword of Truth series based on the last 2 volumes. It is such a shame because, like many of the reviewers here, I loved the earlier books and saw real promise to the series.Why is this one so terrible. Well, have you ever read a book where 80 pages are dedicated to one speech? I counted them. From the point Richard assembles the crowd he wants to talk to, to the point where the conversation finished - it is a staggering 80 pages! In fact, more space is given to that than is given to building to the conclusion.My Goodkind seems to be using these latest volumes to preach at people, and frankly, it makes for a very boring read.Please, please, if you are considering reading the Sword of Truth series - don't. You will only end up disappointed like so many of the other reviewers here."
1,No thanks,"I bought this book because I was wanting to design my own home security system, and was completely disappointed. This book does not give information on how to install a video surveillance system, motion detectors, or alarm systems. It gives a lot of tips on how to avoid doing things that put you at more risk; but to me they're no-brainers. I live way out in the country and the advice he gives for security in the country is laughable. ""Make sure your farm buildings are well-lit"". What difference would that make? Nobody's around at night to see anyone out there trying to steal something, whether it's lit or not."
1,Give me my time back..,"This is a bitter vanity piece that contributes nothing. Way to take a stand when your father is retiring soon and they have nothing to loose.The stuff about the Kerry debate remarks is laughable. Santorum compares you and your girlfriend to having sex a dog. Pat Robertson blames you, as a lesbian, for 9/11 and Hurricane Katrina. Keyes calls you an immoral hedonist. Dobson says that you are unfit to raise a child, etc. But when Kerry mentions your sexuality he is out of bounds.This book is way worse than other conservative books because the author is such a hypocrite. I will be adding my copy to the used section vey soon."
1,tedious and dry,"While it is commendable that the author avoids the verbal fakery, jargon and obfuscation so common amongst academic authors, it is hard to imagine a flatter, duller narrative. The evidence on offer here is anecdotal and therefore of limited value, and since the anecdotes are so mundane, there seems little reason to read the book. Most adults can furnish their own supply of similar stories, have already come to some of the same conclusions, and won't find the insights very insightful. Sociology remains thin stuff."
1,Hmm,"I have all of Straub's horror writings, and so was looking to complete my collection of him with this first novel. Straub calls it a ""not so good"" novel on his website, and he's right. The characters seem like paperdolls, like symbols of something I wasn't smart enough to figure out. The type of visual imagery used to express emotion just doesn't come off here, like it does in the horror books.Still, I am glad to have the book, yellowed and old as it is."
1,Waste Of Time,"A big waste of time. The story wanders through several unlikely scenarios, over a period of 35 years. I kept reading, hoping that it would improve, finally reaching the last page but with no real ending. The author simply left his readers hanging."
1,Please Stop,"This book was light years ahead of Pillars of creation as far as quality, but would have been MUCH better if it were a stand alone book without Richard or Kahlan... it could be in a new world, or a story centered around the more minor characters (such as Nathan or Verna)... it would have only taken a few small changes to make this a stand alone book so we dont have to see another ""Villain of the week""I am a little tired of the first 50 pages reminding us where we are...then some bad guy comes out of nowhere and causes problems for our hero and then they are dispached... maenwhile i guess Emporor Jagang is just waiting miles away eating food and drinking beer waiting for the end of the series...These are rapidly turning into pulp books that resemble a serial much more than an epic saga...Please take 3 years off and write a good book Mr. Goodkind. I know you can do it."
1,Don't waste your time,"This show is hopelessly lame. I had high hopes for it based on the previews. The premise of the show has an identity problem. Is it a comedy, is it a drama? It does neither well. Cancel it now."
1,Buyer beware!!,"I just bought this CD and am totally disgusted with it. Looks like a great line-up of songs, right? Songs that you may have to purchase two or three albums to have, right? That's what I thought too. The fact of the matter is that the titles contained on this disc are NOT the original version of the Smokey songs we all know and love. This kind of duping of the listening and buying public ought to be stopped. Curses to Motown for their attempts at passing off outakes as the originals. It may be awhile, if ever, that I purchase anything on the Motown label. Do yourself and your pocketbook a favor and stay away from this turkey and for that matter, any of Motown's Millenium Masters series. They are a sham!"
1,SSDD,"Anthony Bourdain is a talented chef. He's also a kitchen pig. If you can get passed the cigs, sex, and old food sent out as the 'special of the day', there is some merit. If you can't stand watching his 'No Resevations"" on TV this isn't a book you will enjoy. Really, not worth the $7 I paid for it."
1,Very poor product,"I bought this during thanksgiving day sale. I loved the fact that this player has Wi-Fi and expandable, using the microSD slot. But none that matters if the player never goes off! Yes, for whatever reasons, after a couple of on/off, downloading a song or two, the player would not power off, it got stuck in the welcome screen. Since it does not have a detacheable battery, I had no choice but to return the item to Amazon. Wish Sandisk had paid more attention to product quality."
1,Very dissapointed,"This John Deere playset is so flimsy and frustrating to play with, nothing stays together, and I wished I never bought it!... Do not waste your money on this."
1,DON'T,"they break VERY easily, when they penetrate a slightly hard surface (a hard tree for instance) the black part pops out...I could almost say these bolts are for only one shot. However, the problem may be that my pistol crossbow (80lb) is too powerful for these..."
1,absolutely horrible,"Bad typography and bad layout make this book nearly impossible to read. I've read about a dozen introductions to various philosophers, and this was absolutely the worst one. The book is so poorly laid out, that you can't even tell where some paragraphs begin and end. The translation is on the left pages, the commentary on the right pages. But there's no change in typography between the pages, so the section headings and text seem to jump incoherently.If you want to learn about Hegel philosophy, I suggest finding another source."
1,Questionable,"This is a good product but questionable for women. The back strap has to go around the head, so if you have a hair-do that will get messed up, this will do it. Great for men."
1,Ridiculously short jacket,"My son is only 2 1/2 and the bottom of the jacket came to a little over an inch above the waistband of his jeans. If it is this short on a 2 year old, I can't imagine what it would look like on a child who wears a size 3 or 4. If your child is just barely growing into a 2T, then it might work. My son is beginning to grow out of his 2T clothing and this was way too short. Size aside, the jacket was in good condition. It would've made a very cute costume if it fit properly. It would be nice if the manufacturer would make the jacket length part of its description."
1,Buy the concert dvd instead,"New Springsteen fans may enjoy this anthology, but I was disappointed.The concert dvds are much better."
1,"Creative, but not very interesting","Ella Minnow Pea has a clever title, and in fact is very creatively written. I am sure it took hours of concentration to get everything right. And if you are interested in word play and word games, this is the book for you. The characters and the plot are just incidental. It could be a great allegory about Nazi Germany, but if it is, I missed it. If you are looking for a message or character development, this isn't the place."
1,Total Waste of Money,"I am a huge Bon Jovi fan and I bought this DVD cause it said it had more footage on it then the Live in London DVD and what a mistake I made. The show is Terrible. I have seen the Live in London tour on TV a few times and it was 100x better then this. Jon seems as if he's way past his prime and most of the crowd are old ladies just there cause they have middle aged crushes on Jon from their teenage days. Show was poor, Sound was poor, and I expected alot more."
1,Sigh,"I loved this show. My wife and I moved heaven and earth to watch it every Tuesday. We got everyone we know addicted to it. And then...it turned into Days Of Our Lives. I expect to see satanic twin sisters and infants that leave for college three weeks after birth. It seems that the writers have lost sight of the fact that the show was about CHARACTERS and they have reached for every cheap parlor trick they can think of. What passes for PLOT these days makes me ill. I liked the show because it was INTELLIGENT. WAS. The plots are pathetic and the characters have all been betrayed for the sake of these DREADFUL storylines. Lorilei has become an idiot. Rory is a creature whose soul is beyond salvation. Luke is a wet rag. Only Kirk and Taylor survive. I quit watching before this season ended. I own every other season (season five was purchased with the belief that the show would RECOVER.) I have lost that faith. Veronica Mars, anyone?"
1,This is my 3rd one of these. . .,"so obviously I'm not happy with the quality. This cord is too delicate for a portable device. Plus it is expensive to replace, but you have to buy it or give up and buy a new laptop."
1,Good - But with Important Caveat. Use Gloves to avoid bloody skin pinches.,"This is a well made and very durable hand press for garlic and ginger. BUT BEWARE! The handle can and will severely pinch your skin. I found I needed to wear light leather gloves to avoid getting my skin pinched between the body and handle of the tool. My wife had the same problem and got pinched badly also. CONCLUSION! Its a good tool as long as you are aware of and take serious precautions against what could be a painful, bloody skin pinch. If it is re-engineered to prevent skin pinching it would be a great tool."
1,just not comfortable!,"This comforter is no doubt alergy safe, however it is not at all comfortable. The material on the outside feels like the stuff that a camping tent is made out of, though the tag says that it is 100% cotton. While the fabric is very tight so as not to let any feathers go through, it also doesn't let any air through either. You end up sweating under the blanket or freezing with it off. Also, it is not very generous with the stuffing. It is only about an inch and a half thick, which it fails to mention in the product description. I plan to return mine and next time not be so idiotic as to buy it online without seeing any reviews."
1,good tool to get you started,"This book was a good tool to get you started toward an organized office. There are many tips to help anyone manage their files (I like the idea of a master file closest to your desk) and to keep on track with projects (using the Master List). I was disappointed that this book was published in 1991 and hasn't been updated. There are tons of computer tools that make the chapters on calendars, appointments, even the hand-written Master List obsolete. I do appreciate the ideas this book presented and will use them with the tools on my computer."
1,School Project,"This book was so boring! Out of the 188 pages 3 were interesting. I normally read a book this size in 2-3 hours with no problem. After 10 min. of reading this book I had to stop because it was so boring. I might have enjoyed the book better if I didn't have to read it, but I wouldn't bet the farm on it. Overall I think that it is a waste of time unless you are really, really, REALLY into the Civil War and have a lot of time on your hands.................."
1,BEWARE: Wrong product pictured...,"What you see when you're buying is the picture of a spacious bag, what they send to you is a ridiculously small one, that barely holds a small MiniDV camera.I'm only giving it a ""1"" because, even though this bag just can't hold an extra battery AND an extra tape at the same time, it's well constructed after all...I'm trully very disappointed with this trickery!"
1,"""You get what you pay for!""",I will be returning this DVD player! It is cheap and doesn't work very well! Every movie I've tried to play in it messes up! I wounld NOT recommend buying it!
1,"No tight seal means fruit fly infestation, at least in Colorado","I just moved to Boulder, CO where composting seems to be the norm. I don't mind putting my food in a bucket instead of the garbage disposal, but I do mind the fruit flies that come seemingly out of nowhere when I began doing this. I bought this Ceramic compost keeper thinking it would solve the fruit fly problem. It did not. This product does not have a tight seal on the lid and consequently it allows fruit flies to enter and feast and breed on my rotting food until I make a trip out to the compost pile. Pretty disgusting. Other than that, it's okay..looks nice, washes nicely in the dishwasher, doesn't smell. If there is such a place with no fruit flies, it would work just fine there."
1,Rating of product,Did not like this product. Too much trouble. Went back to Mr. Coffee. Was not simple to operate and required too many steps to make coffee.
1,Wasn't funny,"I read reviews and rating on movie. I was disappointed! Wasn't really funny, more stupid."
1,rent it,"I bought this game because it looked cool.I beat it in about 20 hours.The game is as simple as walking into a room, killing some idiots, and figuring out some simple puzzles.Chopping a zombies head off is funny a total of 1 time.It is defenitly worth a ... rental not a ... buy.The graphics are really good but the game is ify."
1,"Cute teapot, poor packing/shipping.","I bought this teapot recently. It is supposed to come in a ""stylish gift box"" but did not come in a box at all. Inside the amazon box it was just wrapped in bubble wrap, which was a disappointment. Furthermore, the teapot was missing its lid. When I contacted Amazon they said that they could not send me a new lid. I had to return the teapot and they would send me a new one. Their next email said that the teapot was out of stock so I could take a $5 refund and keep the teapot (with no lid) or simply return it. Now I have no teapot. All in all, had it been packed properly (with the lid and in the box that is advertised) it would have been a very cute teapot."
1,Game cube,"I bought a used product and it came with no cables and memory cards. I thought it was obvious that the cables were essential. My children were in expectation, and now I'm looking for the cables so that maybe one day they can use."
1,"Looks good, but not tough enough...","My Palm contains my entire life, so protecting it while keeping it slim and portable are crucial. The ""hardcase"" did not last longer than 2 months before the side of the case ""cracked"". I did not drop it, but used it incessantly on a daily basis. The case is not flexible (no pun) for left-handers either, as there are preformed button moldings cast into the plastic. If you want something durable, portable and slim, I would recommend the Neoprene cases -- they also have a wallet type storage area."
1,Worthless,"Bought this to clean a Cannon Optura. After a few attempts gave up as the ""cleaning"" did not work."
1,Total Bummer!,"It wouldn't play any songs after the second day. Now it only let's me listen to one second of a song and then stops it. I constantly have to press the ""Play"" button.Overall, I would say, ""If you want to gamble, go ahead. But don't expect this thing to hold up for too long.""It seems to me, like this is just a cheap immitation of the original. (Both in price and quality)"
1,"Looks great on paper, but failed my tests","For me this camera had the perfect mix of features so I picked it up to record my hiking adventures. First off the motor was so loud it was terrible (louder than my gal's voice in some scenes). I took it up Mt Timpanogos and discovered that not only was it too loud, but the 360 degree mic was overpowered by even the smallest breezes, and colors of flowers and plants got totally washed out in bright sunlight (can be corrected by a filter). The B&W viewfinder is useless (I couldn't make out a deer standing in shadow 20 meters away) and the LCD is hard to see in bright sun. It was also way too heavy to carry in a pack all day. In low light conditions it gets very grainy (to be expected, but not to this degree). I returned it and now am trying a DCRTRV17. Same mic and LCD but with a color VF, much smaller and lighter (DVC), a super quiet motor, but only 10x op-zoom."
1,Doesn't cook evenly,"I never figured out the trick to this product. I tried different amounts of time and wattages in my microwave, but I could never get the eggs to cook evenly or to the consistency I like. I stopped using it after a month or so."
1,Be aware of the quality and customer service,"I bought it in February this year. It worked fine until this month. But suddenly it stopped working. I called their customer service several times but I never got the chance to talk to a live person. Instead I was directed to a voice mail and ""hoping"" someone will call me back. I also sent them an email but up to today no one contacted me yet. So if you buy one then good luck and hope it will work. Otherwise you will end up like me, waiting just to get any response from them. Their customer service really sucks."
1,Wrong color and damaged -- but nice otherwise!,"Two giant problems with this chair. First, one of the main side pieces had two giant cracks in it. So right there I needed to return it. As a bonus, though, the color was completely different from pictured, but not really enough like any of the other colors pictured to make me confident enough that they just sent the wrong one. I ordered the walnut, but the color that came was more like a golden oak. Not light enough to be natural but not red enough to be mahogany. I'll attach pictures to the review if I can. The wood did seem nice (aside from being cracked and a bit scratched in one place) and for the price it might be worth ordering again to get an uncracked version, but I think I am going to try to find one in person instead."
1,"Too quick, too short","I found that by the time I was in the pose being taught, Mr. Yee was already moving on to the next pose. I usually find yoga relaxing, but this video made me feel rushed and out of sync. Also, the routine was over very quickly, and seemed shorter than 30 minutes. In my opinion, this video was a waste of time and money."
1,Died in <5 minutes,"We purchased the ladybug and inchworm buggies for our young girls. The girls raced each around the room for lots of fun. However, the fun lasted less than 5 minutes as the radio-controlled aspect of the ladybug stopped. Nothing changed. No appliances turned on in the home or phones that rang. We tried several ways to reset it to no avail. We plan to return it for a replacement as the inchworm has worked just fine. Make sure you have alternate gifts or plans if you buy this one!"
1,Not worth the price.,"This thing is a bit flimsy and lightweight; although in a way that's good so you can move it around. Problem is, the existing anchor system will NOT hold it in the ground during strong winds. I was out in the garden at 6 a.m. trying to keep the thing from being torn to shreds in the last Nor'easter. The instructions (which are awful) suggest supplemental anchoring in windy conditions (I live on a mountain side so yes, that fits). But they don't really tell you how to secure it properly. Instead of planting and doing real gardening tomorrow, I'll be working on some kind of way to secure this thing to the ground so it's not a total loss--probably wires, stakes, anchors, etc. What a pain!"
1,Complete garbage. Should be taken off the market!,"It amazes me that anything like this ridiculously designed mouse trap could ever make it to the market. Designing a mouse trap is not rocket science and apparently the ""engineers"" at Victor are not the sharpest tools in the shed. Do not waste your money on this piece of crap mouse trap. This company deserves to go out of business for putting such a bad product on the market. These traps are impossible to set and a complete waste of time. I will throw these away and try to find another solution. I have a good idea for VICTOR, close your doors and go out of business, take your products off the market and do everyone a favor. I want my money back!"
1,Starts to crack after 4 days of use,"I can't believe this! The handle is cracking in 4 places and I've only had it a week! It works great, but I'm astonished that no one tested this plastic under the conditions that someone would actually used it. I am VERY disappointed. I have talked to others and gues what! Cracks started forming on their 100 dolloar toothbrushes also! At this price, this appliance should be a lot more strudy."
1,Weird but washed out,"Be warned that the colors in this dvd are exceptionally bright and washed out. The movie itself is great, in an Ed Wood mimics softcore Godard ala Bava sort of way. But if you're expecting a quality dvd image, think again. The transfer is acceptable, but the print is as faded as a hippy's blue jeans."
1,NOt that impressed,"I am not that impressed with this man's books. They are sick and morbid and kind of perverse. Yes, I think it's facinating that he has taken and retold these age old stories, which would be a wonderful idea if they werent so crude. I personally wouldnt read anymore of his books."
1,Not a good purchase,"Very disappointed. After paying an extra 12.07 customs, the dvds don't work on my machine. I'll ask friends for help but what does 'wrong region' mean? Other American dvds have worked OK. An expensive mistake."
1,Problems,"I bought this camera for my daughter for Christmas. In early January the battery failed to charge. After navigating the Fuji website and then calling their repair dept. I sent the battery back and waited. Meanwhile my daughter had a school trip scheduled. After repeated calls the new battery arrived. Lo and behold it still would not charge. I was told to return the camera, battery and charger. I bought my daughter another camera to take on her trip (NOT a Fuji). I spoke to Fuji camera repair today. They have had the camera for a week. They gave me a ref # and said to call back in another week.I cannot tell you how well this camera takes pictures because it has never worked for more than one day.Bad product and terrible customer service. You have been warned."
1,Bad DVD,This DVD wouldn't play at all. My husband was so happy to get it and so disappointed when it wouldn't play.
1,Boring,It lacked interest and was just boring; I fell asleep. The character were just going through the motions without any real purpose.
1,Not worth the shipping costs,"I bought this headset to use with my cordless panasonic phone. I pluged it into my home phone and was Very surprised when it ruined my phones they no longer work I have to put them on speaker to hear anyone now. The headset fit but all I could hear was a fuzzy sound, now I have two panasonic phones that I can hardley stand to use. I don't remember seeing a warning that these are not compatable with my phones. Can you please replace my phones or do I now need to spend another 100.00 for new phones? My phones are only 4mo's old.Please get back to me about what you can do for me.Thanks,Rachelle, Burlingame, CA"
1,frustrating,I purchased this item 5 days ago and they didn't ship it YET !!So slow. It's not good customer service at all.
1,Foot tapping & Head scratching,"These songs are from Candi Staton's three pre-Disco Southern Soul albums [1969, '71, `73] recorded at FAME studios in Muscle Shoals, Alabama.The music is good, but the packaging is lacking. There is an essay, but no track information is provided (no years or personnel or even the titles of the three albums from which the songs are taken). The sound quality is decent, but leaves much to be desired"
1,Susie's Pumpernickle/Rye Flatbread,It is awful. My friend and I split a box and we both threw it out. This product tastes like cardboard.
1,"Vile, Ripoff - or mabe just useless","Just the thing if you want your leather to smell like old crayons. Seems to be nothing but mineral oil emulsified in water with a tiny bit of coloring to throw it a hair off white. If you think mineral oil is good for leather, you can mix (emulsify) some with water and soap and save yourself the expense of this nonsense. Leaves a greasy film that is very hard to remove. Real saddle soap has always done a better job for me.Amendment:After a few days the stickiness was no longer evident and the smell was just unremarkably leatherish. Maybe it's good for the leather but I could not detect any change in softness of some areas that started out dry feeling."
1,Knife of Dreams Not worth the Money,"Same old, same old.The politics are boring, the description of every object ad nauseum is mind numbing and the characters are the same cookie-cutter characters that fill all of Jordan's other novels.Do not buy this novel. Start Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire series instead and enjoy mature, complex, and exciting characters along with a gripping storyline for a change."
1,"the content seems not OK, and smells weird. I was very disapointed","the content seems not OK, and smells weird. I was very disapointed. I'm a current customer of the same product for many years, so I know very well that's a false product.4711 By Muelhens For Men. Eau De Cologne Splash 27 Oz."
1,Don't order from Amazon,"This is for a G01W006 which is the updated version that includes RAID 1. If you're looking for RAID 1, don't order this from Amazon/CompUSA!!! They will ship you the G01Y006 (with a ""Y"") which does not have the RAID 1 capability, only RAID 0. What a pain!!!!"
1,What radio and tv commercial does NOT use that song??,"The song I speak of is ""All Star"". It has been played a billion times in movies, television and radio commercials that sell everything from insurance to automobiles. The song is not even good. The rest of the CD is bland nu-alternative. Smash mouth is the definition of ""sellout""."
1,I'm confused...,"""Allow yourself to be enveloped by the love within and all around you. Know that you are constantly giving birth to the divine love within you..."" (p. 81). And so it goes, page after page of this pap.Where is Jesus?Don follows the path of Carolyn Myss and Mirabai Starr (Don recommends Starr's books)in gutting our saint's writing of anything centered on Christ the Beloved.If you are looking for good meditation material truly faithful to St. Teresa and her Inner Castle, try Muto (Where Lovers Meet), McLean (Towards Mystical Union), and Humphreys (From Ashes to Fire).BTW: The 2011 paperback by Don, Meditations with Teresa of Avila, appears to be a reprint of this hardcover."
1,Fake Video,"This video is a fake and does not contain the video listed,it contains a video called lottery ticket and it appears to be a copy of this video,Warning!!!"
1,The only funny part of this book is the table of contents,"I am amazed people find this book funny. Well crafted, and an excellent mimic of the styles of legalese, Boswell, et. al. But funny - no. It is a veritable ""potemkin village"" of a humor book, like Mad Magazine written by a bunch of engineers who don't know when to stop but who must carry something to its logical extreme. (I'm an engineer myself). Had there not been reviews from other Amazon.com customers, I would have said the dust jacket reviewers never read the book"
1,"Fun, but strictly for kids","Snow day is an OK movie. But adults may find it a bit boring. It is by the way a nickelodeon movie, so it aims at younger viewers. Despite it is only 89 mins, 84 mins for the features and 5 minutes for the credit, the movie feels a bit long. Not enough Chevy Chase, so the funny moments are limited as well. The younger actors' give excellent performances. The DVD's picture quality is OK and the 5.1 Dolby Digital has very limited activities. It worths to be watched once not to keep. Just rent this one."
1,Judgmentalism overshadows the content,"If you are looking for historical scholarship on Calamity Jane, look elsewhere in more recent publications. I was surprised that an academic work, even in the 1950s, would so blatantly depend on judgements about Calamity's lifestyle and habits. Beed Sollid is downright hostile to her subject. Perhaps even more surprising is that the newer introductions and conclusions of the 1995 edition do not call the author out. I simply could not take the the work seriously with this attitude interwoven throughout. Her judgmentalism overshadows the content."
1,poor quality,"I have owned this item for 2 months and the belt clip came out of the case and I almost lost my phone, now I have to put my belt thru the loops on the case. I won't buy another."
1,It's Novel Religion,"As a believer I don't WANT to post anything but a positive review of a Christian-based book but in spite of the press, in spite of the decade it took to get all 12 books published in this series, the writing falls flat so many times. The 12 books, if made into a trilogy of three slightly-longer books, would have been tighter and a much better read. I'm afraid that weak writing and a story that was S-T-R-E-T-C-H-E-D into 12 volumes so obviously on purpose to sell books hurts our witness and makes it harder for other Christian fiction to enter the mix."
1,Melted my toilet flapper: Do Not Buy,"I will never use this product again as it has melted the rubber flappers of two of my Toto toilets, turning them into the consistency of soft pink bubble gum that flakes off, and causing the valves to leak. (Wish I had read Bubba's review above before I bought this product.)I am shocked that Clorox still sells this product and that no warning label appears on the box.Nowadays I only use Lysol liquid toilet bowl cleaner: http://www.amazon.com/Lysol-Toilet-Cleaner-Ounce-Count/dp/B006RG0S8K/ref=pd_sbs_hpc_3"
1,Great product but incomplete and had to pay postage,The product was great but they left out one of the shapes. I contacted seller and they told me they would handle it and credit us the shipping that we ended up paying for above what was quoted when it arrived. They haven't contacted us back or sent missing shape. They were very responsive the first time but didn't follow through.
1,C. E. Lawrence,"Do not be misled by the title of this book. It is not, as I expected it to be, a scholarly treatment in Christian Appologetics addressing the manner in which God would have politics work, according to Biblical teachings, in our nation and the world. Instead, this book monotonously espouses a so-called ""progressive"" approach to infusing politics with ultra liberal attitudes toward morality, throughout an agonizingly long and redundant diatribe against George W. Bush and those holding a true Biblical Worldview. This ""progressive"" attitude has no basis in Biblically based Christian theology. If Mr. Wallis is an Evangelist, at all, he is clearly not a Christian Evangelist. If you are a liberal, and particularly if you are an avid Bush-basher, you will like the book. For those truly seeking to know how God would have us conduct politics, however, don't waste your time or money on this book."
1,Unsatisfactory,"The book has a great collection of maps; however, sidetracks from major aspects of Egyptian history. The information presented on the 25th Dynasty, is particularly unsatisfactory. Major events like the battle of 701 BC between Egypt's 25th Dynasty and Assyria, which changed map of the middle east, is vaguely mentioned. The information presented is inconsistent and certainly unsatisfactory for the average reader."
1,WHY so much money?,"WHY would anyone pay close to 300 dollars for this?? You can buy each season brand new for 45.99 each...There's only four seasons, so why would you pay an extra 100+ dollars to have them all wrapped up together?Nice work Amazon, brilliant."
1,lighten up,"Am I missing something? The reviews are full of sound and fury, told by so many, for a book signifying very little."
1,Not very good.,I thought this book would be a good thriller and for a while it was.The author has constructed the book using a series of 2 or3 page chapters .The chapters jump from character to character with each chapter having a suspensfull ending.This system works for a while but after a while this gets a bit dull and there is very little character development. The book gets boring and eventually I didn't care about any of the characters or how the book ended.The book started on a high note but quickly went down hill.
1,One star is overrating this book,"This book was intriging at first glance - a haunted house and a girl determined to drive out the ghost. However,as a mystery story and a horror story, it fails miserably. Most of the book is the introduction of characters, plot, and setting. It is only in the last chapter that she actually enters the haunted house at night- when the ghost comes out. All that happens is wind, whispering, scary plaster faces, and one character tripping. Oh, the horror. She finally finds out why the ghost was there and tells it to leave. The ghost's reason for staying was basically a re-enactment of a Poe tale. One of the two books that held clues to the mystery was a book of Poe's tales, but the author could have been a lot more creative."
1,Holy crap.,"I give this two stars only because it's historically important as a Wiccan/Neopagan foundation document. I don't know how anyone ever took Murray's ""theory"" seriously because it's so incoherent. Having read this book twice, I'm still not sure exactly what she meant to prove; her ""thesis"" only becomes clear when filtered through other authors. Murray seems to have assumed that if she kept lobbing enough ""witch trial evidence"" at readers (especially if such documents were in foreign languages), they'd believe her through sheer exhuastion. Judging by this tome, Murray would not pass a college level elementary logic course today. She would certainly never have been admitted to a basic cultural anthropology class."
1,Not good enough!,This product don't work very well with Windows Vista. Also it don't work with quick time video at all. I am disappointed and there is not many video capture card that work with Windows Vista at this time so the HDV features is the only good things about it.
1,A Disappointment,"This was a huge disappointment. The Advertisment says it is solid gold, it is hollow.The gold also wasn't gold, it seemed more copper colored, and it didn't clean up well. I returned this before I even got it home."
1,Junk,Got one of these quick shipped to help a hurt employee drive rods. Tried it out in lawn in front of shop/office. Got a 5/8 galvanized rod about 4 feet into ground and the driver came apart. It broke right at the junction between the holder and the shaft. Metal looked like pot junk. Sent it back.
1,"Overlong, overstuffed, overrated","Each passing year emphasizes what a gimmicky, overblown, ultimately empty mess ""Pulp Fiction"" is, especially as it becomes clearer what a one-trick pony its director is.The handful of strong, funny, provocative scenes in the film are undone by others that seem to go on for days. The Travolta-Thurman sequence seems especially forced and tedious now, and the set-up of the Bruce Willis-Ving Rhames showdown is shamefully flabby. And the closing diner sequence is beyond anticlimactic.Tarantino seems so determined to display his own prodigious cleverness that he refuses to impose any economy on the story or how it's told. As a result, what might have been a fast-paced, dizzying thrill ride with some judicious editing is instead a leaden, 160-minute valentine from Quentin Tarantino to his own perceived genius."
1,Pure Junk,"I was looking for a net for my Chevrolet Impala similar to my wife's factory net. This isn't it! This net is 1/2 the web thickness, it's too long for a car (better for a truck or suv) and it's advertised depth of 12"" is only when stretched out good. Relaxed it is 5 or 6 inches. The factory net is at least 12-14"" un-stretched. In addition the ends of the factory net are sealed. This one is open for all your stuff to escape. It is so poor overall that I sent it back and will try something else. If you are looking to even closely mimic a factory $45 net don't waist your time here! In fact the $45 net is a much better value than this $17 net."
1,"Damage Property, Injure People, Commit Crimes, Immoral Acts","This book has no dirty tricks. It only tells how to damage property, injure people, commit crimes, ruin reputations, and do immoral and disgusting things. One ""funny"" trick involves child abuse."
1,Too uncomfortable,"I purchased these head phones to accompany my iPod. After wearing it 6 times, it does not accompany anything anymore. They cancel out noise in reasonable manner (you can't expect miracles for this price), but it is so terribly uncomfortable. On my 7 hour flight I started off enjoying its noise-cancelling capabilities, but could not wear it for any longer than 2 hours. They are very tight and literally cause me headaches. It is just such a shame ...If I could only return these headphones and purchase the Sennheiser PXC 250 (they are fab!!)"
1,TERRIBLE,"Oh, please. I did not read this book because it was on Oprah's list. I read it because I heard that it was so good. Well, it wasn't. Lamb thinks he can write from a woman's point of view but he just can't. I doubt that he experienced any of the things that the main character did. He has no idea how one might express these feelings and deal with them. I must admit that I can see why Oprah reccomended it. (the whole bit with losing weight seems very fimilar) I thought that Oprah had better taste, I guess I was wrong. Next time Wally ""write what you know."""
1,Good but with a fatal flaw.,"I bought this book in a used book store. It is a good dictionary, however it does not list noun genders in any way, making this book completely useless unless your source material indicates gender. This would have been a great dictionary but how such a huge flaw got through I don't understand."
1,What???????,"When I was about 12 my uncle (who loved it when he was a kid) played it on his computer. Being someone, who (at the time) would watch anything for lack of better things to do, managed to sit through it. my 10 year old brother tried to turn it off, but did not know how to work a DVD-Rom.IT MADE ABSOLUTELY NO SENSE!!!!!! Mabye if I was smoking pot I would have been able to catch on to the ""artistic quality"" of the movie. Or mabye I just lack the occult knowledge to understand it. Mabye I should have played it backwards. Well, blinded by my myopic view of REALITY, I couldn't make any sense of it. There is one thing I want to find out; how did this movie get made? What was the writer smoking?"
1,"Clever idea, no character development","For the first half of the book, I was excited and amused by Jennifer Government, but Barry's idea of character development is having the characters have sex. For the second half of the book, I just didn't care about the characters. There were only shallow, cliche reasons for the characters to do what they do. Also, he left loose ends at the end of the book. Three characters just disappeared. Barry's idea that corporations take over the world is an interesting extreme, but he relies too much on guns and explosions than having characters' actions make sense."
1,The good (?) old days.,"The book is well written and I enjoyed it when I bought it back in the 80's. I re-read it a few years ago and threw it away. I sort of wish I hadn't.If you're interested in how things were done years ago you might want to read this book but remember, there are reasons things are no longer done the way this book describes.One thing that stuck in my mind was the tremendous amounts of meats that many of the lifters ate. No need for steroids back then when you're consuming all of that steroid packed red meat.If you look at this from an historical perspective it's a great book to have. It has lots of good pictures of the old time greats. Don't base your beginning powerlifting career on the information in this book."
1,Serviceable but needs work,"I really appreciate the reviews others took the time to write.I absolutely love the Motorola V60, (even though I agree that the Menu System and documentation are not nearly as easy or intuitive as with a Nokia.)The Belt Clip Holster is cumbersome. It required my engineering hat, (something I have had to learn how to wear... not a natural talent,) to figure out. Even so I feared it would release the phone, so I was glad to read of others confidence based on their StarTac experience.I can appreciate that it is difficult to ergonomically design a carrying device for a flip phone. The current clip holder works, it is just too bulky and requires a lot of practice to smoothly release the phone from the clips. Still, I have to believe that some sort of holster or pouch is possible that is far more attractive and practical than what is currently offered.I hope the design team at Motorola is working on it."
1,frontline plus order,"I ordered frontline for my cats because I am told it is a great product.I get it cost more because it is good but, why is it when I ordered the producton Oct.1,2010 it will not be sent out until or around Oct.12-14,2010???????I ordered it from Amazon because I needed it real bad & they have never let me down,until now.They took my money right away so why do I have to wait so long? I just don't think it is real fair & if I would have caught that it would take so long I wouldn't have ordered it from here.My cats have flea's now !!!"
1,Waste of money,"I bought this jump rope because I figured there couldn't be that much difference in basic models. I mean it's a rope between to handles! Sadly I was mistaken, like previous reviews, the rope is limp and hardly makes it around more than a few times before it trips you up. Save your bucks and spend a few more bucks to get a good rope."
1,Definitely not what I expected,The product that I received (Elephant pendant) was far too small(and cheesy) to justify even half of the price that I paid. I had to go to a store and purchase a second pendant for my girlfriend so that she would not be disappointed. I would NEVER purchase anything from this merchant again.
1,Is it over yet?,"Like many other reviewers, I have been dragged into reading this book by a literature class. The story line is mildly interesting, but most of the book contains fluff that is pointless and you just have to suffer through. The language is also very difficult to understand and not a ""skimmable"" book, by any means. If you really insist on reading this book, I would suggest getting the SparkNotes or the Cliff Notes. They tell you all you need to know: There's an orphan. His name is Pip. By a chain of events, Pip recieves a great deal of money. He moves to London and becomes extremely arrogent. And it goes on. Not the most enjoyable endeavor."
1,Very flimsy....,We ordered the item twice because first time it came broken. But second time also was the same result. You may like it if the set comes in one piece.
1,The Millionaire Next Door,"Product was rated online as 'new condition, but condition is somewhat worn in appearance, dirty."
1,One year limited use vacuum,This was a good vacuum for the 12 or so times it has been used over the last year. It is now broken. The beater brush does not spin. I thought I would get more than a few uses from a Eureka product.
1,smells bad,"I purchased this after seeing many positive reviews...unfortunately, the negative reviews regarding smell were right on. It smelled like permanent solution and did nothing for my hair."
1,Don't purchase this piece of junk!!!,"This unit had mulitple failures, everything was replaced at one point or another in time span of less than a year. It has a major reliability/design issue. I had it repaired just last week and it failed again. Don't waste your money on this laptop. I have had many Dell products before and this XPS M2010 is the only one that does not meet my expectation. I was very disappointed with recent Dell performance both in their technical support and customer service personnel. They keep transferring my call and even hang up on me. Dell tech support even lied to me on system replacement. I am fed up with their excuses and Dell has moved to bottom of my list of future PC suppliers."
1,i just don't think it works,"i bought this product because i suffer from varicose veins/poor leg circulation. i've been taking the supplement for a few months now, and i am not noticing any improvement in my legs or in the appearance of veins. will not be purchasing again."
1,Some books ARE trashworthy,"First book I ever threw in the trash because it was so bad. Worst graphic novel I have ever read. Trust me on this one: Don't get this book. It does nothing but dis the ancient Greeks' culture, and it's not even that funny. A total waste of money."
1,TALKING DIRTY WITH THE QUEEN OF CLEAN,MORE OR THE SAME THING I HAVE READ IN OTHER BOOKS. NOTHING NEW. THOUGHT IT WOULD GIVE ME MORE SOLUTIONS TO THINGS. NOT WORTH THE MONEY.
1,Ripoff,I paid 2.99 a fifteen ounce jar or roughly 9 bucks for three. Grossly overpriced here. Avoid this ripoff and look for cheaper. Also when measured out this fifteen ounce was barely more than an eight ounce cup. The fifteen ounces are not by liquid measure but by actual weight.&#128078;
1,Could have been better.,"Pilch's book uses medical/anthropological models to explore healing in the NT. Chapter three, which contrasts modern medicine with that of the first century, is excellent. However, the book is poorly edited and includes a great deal of redundancy (could have been 50 pages shorter). Pilch's dim view of Jesus as healer is unimaginative and uninspiring."
1,internet more useful,"go read stuff from the web. this book is very basic and not better than stuff that can be found for free. it is, however, less prone to dust and impact damage than a laptop... equally prone to water damage."
1,Go for the Real Heart of this Great Work.,"I do have to point out that it is a exoteric, orthodox, and elementary interpretation of this fine Treatise. The Charles Johnston 'Forgotten Books' Version of the Crest-Jewel of Wisdom is by far the most accurate and esoteric translation. That publisher's Type set and other changes as mentioned by them, do make it the best and most readable reprint available. Many of Sankara's other great writings are also included. You will not find them else where. ""Viveka Chudamani"".The Original 1946 Theosphical University Press Covina version is a Great edition also, Most worthy of picking up a pristine copy.The 1964 Watkins version is a complete rewrite;where over 25 years after his first Version, he decided to rewrite under a different perspective.Though worth having both... I would go with the first version if you desire a 'True Essence' translation. The Charles Johnston translations are simply the Only versions worth Reading.True Non Dualism...Advaita & Sankara."
1,liberal think tanker,The book is a myoptic view of the younger generaion from a New York liberal thinktank member. All problems with the financial sucess of the youger generation are the fault of the government and young people just can't afford to live in New York or LA.She misses the fact that the tax load in the 70's was about 1/3 of today's load and people could save more. She misses the fact that a large expensive college degree is a waste of money for many people. She is also ignorant of the fact that many younger people are being very sucessful without an expensive degree and in smaller cities and towns.Basically the book is a waste of time and money and I was very disappointed.
1,"Does not help, some tastes terrible","These didn't come close to helping me. Not only that, but most of them tasted terribly. B-Natals were slightly more helpful, and Morning Wellness Tea by Earth Mama Angel Baby was the most helpful. All in all, nothing will make bad morning sickness magically disappear, but these Preggie Pops? Worthless."
1,Bad quality,"I was given this as a gift from our friends and we loved the look of them to add to our collection! However, there was nothing on the box that said NOT DISHWASHER SAFE but there really should have been because one go through our dishwasher caused the giant sticker that is the designs to peel off and now Jack has no head. :( We never even got to use them once. *sigh* If the product is going to be so badly made their packaging should show it!"
1,Almost a ......,"I must be honest. This was a very predictable read. The plot is typical, couple meets after parting years before., sparks fly...I honestly thought I had read this book before. The writing was witty and tasteful. Not a hard read, great for a rainy afternoon."
1,Outsiders Take,"In her ""book"" Shawnie talks about her hometown of Columbus. She currently resides in Upper Arlington. My understanding is that her hometown is actually Pittsburgh. Although it does have some concise information, the book is fileld with omissions. She neglects the entirety of the area known as Olde Towne East. She neglects historic Livingston Park. She neglects the entirety of the Gay Community. I guess since my family has lived here for 5 generations, I have a truly insider's view on Columbus and Ms. Kelley seems to have completely deleted the City in which I live.D-"
1,I AGREE WITH travevectr@aol.com ABOVE!,"I have to agree with travevectr@aol.com. This book was half an afternoon's entertainment for me. I got tired of seeing so many omissions and inaccuracies. The author wonders if Wumpus existed? Hello! What about Oregon trail? How about the entire racing game genre? How about the evolution of shooting games? She likes to repeat the same tired names, Missle Command, Pac-Man, yet neglects huge amounts of games that had wide distribution. Her timeline was incomplete. I guess I should have written this book. A lot of wordsmith, but lacking in substance. The ending is like driving off a cliff. Next thing you know, it's just over. I was looking to see if there was something wrong with my copy, like pages missing.A topic with great potential, mostly unrealized. :("
1,Credibility,Highly improbable and not worth the effort. Begs for a sequel with a solid comeback such that the first novel makes sense.
1,Looks better then it works,I have to say that I was so excited to buy this blender but it has not lived up to all the features. I have found that its leaks when you pour from the spout and today the spout just broke off. For the $59.99 I paid I thought it would have worked much better and lasted longer. I am very disappointed.
1,One star is too much,"We didn't get this through Amazon and were totally disgusted with it. It was unable to perform the basic function of pouring a cup of coffee without dribbling it everywhere. This is bad enough when pouring coffee and is even worse when filling the base unit. Didn't make any difference to pour slowly or quickly, with or without the lid. Although it seems to make sense to have a stainless carafe, not being able to see what's left in the pot is a bit of a pain and I'm sure is the reason for the 30 minute shut off. The problem is that 30 minutes is a bit short and only seems to add to the annoyance. Furthermore, Cuisinart simply ignored attempts to contact them."
1,...,I really did not enjoy this collection of Holloween stories. A few stories were okay but overall it was horrible. Especially the anti-abortion sermon. Really inappropriate.
1,not for kids,"This book is a creative display of Legos by the author. He is gifted in his Lego ability and clearly spent a lot of time putting these images together. However, this book is not child-friendly nor should it be given to a child. His website posts warning of inappropriate images.This book is not Biblically correct, does not use a specific translation and seems to be formed out the opinion of the author. If you are looking for a Bible for your child please visit a legitimate Christian bookstore or website for suggestions.It truly saddens me that this book has been placed into the hands of children by well meaning parents or loved ones."
1,DVD had a glitch during the best part of the movie.,It skipped forward and wouldn't play. Disappointed. Bought to give as a gift and wish I had previewed it before I did.
1,Same Old Same Old ...,"Dull and uninspired. Everything on this disc seems to be a tired re-hash of the fair-to-middling ""B-side"" tracks from her recent albums. Definitely will listen to the next one BEFORE I buy it."
1,"Save for the ""Breaking"" 15 days after Buying it...","15 days after buying this, I put a cup of water into it to warm it up to make some pizza dough. After 20 seconds of cooking, the microwave spontaneously shut off. So I repeated the process with the same results -- this time with a whiff of ozone. The third time the same thing happened.After reading about the explosions and other failures with this microwave, I am returning it sans calling Panasonic.And really this is too bad. From a design and features perspective, this is a very cool microwave. However the third factor in considering its worth is ""Does it work?"" That last question was a resounding NO. Pass on Panasonic."
1,quite outdated,"OK intro for technical readers, but there is a lot here that is completely out of date since the book was written in 1997. Lots of new and revised standards have been published since then."
1,cast iron column broken in two in shipment,"Delta, if you are reading this, the problem of cast iron breakage is in your packing...there are two reasonable and economic ways to fix your problem.ONE..use a minimum of six inces of molded styrofoam at the edge of the base. A coulpe inches of styrofoam at the base edge is not going to dampen the shock on a unit this heavy in the event it is dropped. Even if it is only a foot or so....and or,TWO..disconnect the column from the base. You seperate the column and motor from the base during shipping and I think your problem is solved. Now if the unit is dropped during shipping you will not have the kinetic energy transfering to the column and motor which is brittle and top heavy. Newton's 4th law of motion still applies today...just remove the weak linkDelta, why do you take so long to address this issue???P.S. Sorry Norm"
1,Omni Cable Managment,"I was very disappointed in the way Amazon promoted this product. I bought this because it was shown as something other people bought when they were buying the omni shelf. So I bought it as a set, well I know I should have paid better attention as the shelf had about a 4 inch cable management system and this was maybe 2 inches so they do not go together at all. I am sure that it would work fine if that is what you want but I spent $20 on something that didn't work for me because of the way Amazon promoted it."
1,really? you had such a good story dialog,"really? you had such a good story dialog going on, why did you have to throw in soft porn in the first third of the book? not everyone wants to read so much sex in a book...good writers didn't have to resort to this type of writing. i deleted the book off my kindle and won't finish it."
1,Invasive Without a Cause,"While I appreciate Wim Wenders' desire to fulfill Nick Ray's last wish and admire his courage to grope his way forward without a script, I question the merit of filming his friend's dying days. Though it was at Nick's behest, it seemed an indecent invasion of privacy. I would say (with Matthew Arnold), ""Spare me the whispering, crowded room, the friends who come and gape and go, the ceremonious air of gloom - all, which makes death a hideous show."""
1,DO NOT PURCHASE,"This router constantly needs rebooting. At first it was once a week, now it's almost every day! I've read other reviews which have had the same problems."
1,"I AGREE THAT THIS IS NO ""RESTORATION""","At paying full price at $29.99 at Barnes & Noble and reading that it was a restored print from George Eastman House, I was expecting a lot more than what I saw. The DVD from a few years ago was better than this, though still flawed and needing further restoration. I give 2 stars only that the story is still one of the greatest regarding Hollywood of yesteryear. The transfer to Bluray is a shear disappointment, sound & picture, especially when one of the trailers for ""Nothing Sacred"" with Carole Lombard that is included in the Features portion is in so much better shape than this film. That film was restored. Someone needs to call Martin Scorcese, Thelma Schoonmaker & their teams to get this one back into pristine condition. I'm not wasting money on this classic again until it is fully remastered the way ""Gone With The Wind"" was done. Flawlessly."
1,Disapointed,"My daughter loves Elmo so I had to get this for her!We got it, blew it up(that took for ever) and she was so excited to see it. First off there is NO slide, why call it a slide? Next after playing in it for an hour I noticed that the front was collapsing. I inflated it again, an hour later it was deflated again. We tried to find a leak and could not. So now it sits on my porch in the corner unused. My 2 year old is so dissapointed"
1,A curate's egg,"Why has ""Nikki Hoshino"" written three (slightly) different reviews for this book?This is possibly a sincere effort, but it isn't very good for all that, and it displays its colours as a self-published (iUniverse) title all the time. In my opinion if you can't distinguish between ""principle"" and ""principal"" you shouldn't be writing a book, editor or no editor. Picky? I don't think so.I've given it two stars because I found two interesting things in it. Though I can't remember what they are.To be honest there are few if any good books on how to make money in mail order out there. I'm waiting on Melvin Powers's classified ads book, and crossing my fingers that it will be The One."
1,Less than Reliable,"I can live with the annoying date-setting issue mentioned above, but what I cannot live with is the fact that it looses anywhere from 15-20 minutes a day. For a ""quality"" watch, that is inexcusable. I purchased this nicer watch, rather than sticking with ""disposible"" watches like Timex, because it seemed that it would work well for someone with an active lifestyle, whose watches get soaked and beaten up on a daily basis. I think I should have stuck with the Timex. I am very disappointed with this purchase, and, if like the poster above, I have to shell out $25 to get the piece of junk fixed, I can guarantee that I will never purchase another in the future."
1,Very disappointed in the lack of detail,"I guess I really shouldn't be surprised. How can a 144pg book compare to the detail given in the factory Mopar Performance books when Chrysler spends about 400pgs on each engine family!If you just want a brief overview of what engines were offered this is fine. For anyone really interested in making some power or hot rodding their Mopar, get the Mopar Performance book for your specific engine.Too bad they don't have a money-back guarantee. Based on the reviews I thought this book would be much better"
1,Nearly worthless.,"I bought this to replace a worn-out Emjoy Gold Caress (which worked great, by the way). This thing certainly was 'Sin Dolor' (Painless). It also did not do the job. I went over and over a couple of long hairs but it just wouldn't get them. Ended up tweezing. I am going to go for another Gold Caress, or may try the Braun epilator."
1,Most depressing film ever....!,"This is the most depressing film ever!...There is not one redeeming factor, that has any impact on the audience. Robert Carlyle's character, where he randomly beats the crap out of folks that he gets in a brawl with is so terribly annoying!!! Unless, if you really have no direction in life, or lavish a sadistic, twisted nature, then this movie is by all means for you..."
1,Terrible !!!!!,"This has to be one of the worst movies of 2001.The big problem, other than Chris Tucker's unfunny big mouth, is the lame plot. (A suggestion to the producers: spend a few extra dollar on writers who can actually put together a coherent, well-thought out story.)Save yourself some $$$ and avoid this one."
1,Don't waste your money,If your looking to watch a nice lesbian love story this definitely isn't one of them don't waste your money I promise you'll regret buying it just like I did...
1,No customer service,"if you ever have to call Weber customer service you are in trouble.They employ the nicest sounding, most polite people on the face of the earth but they are clueless.They are worse than the the strictest script reading overseas CSR's because they are convinced that you are stupid and the key to your intellectual salvation lies on the scripted response sheet they have in front of them.If you have mechanical or engineering experience that indicates what they are telling you might be wrong, well you are just a silly man!!"
1,Not great story for little ones.,I got this book for my 3 yr old son. He loves ABC books and pirates. This story is dry and doesn't engage him like other ABC books. H is for Haunted House is much better. It is engaging and he love sit.
1,Plastair Springjet,The plastic hose connector and washer are not leak proof when connecting to any hose bibb and leaks will occur unless you make a better seal with teflon tape.
1,Be careful,"Be careful reading this book. I found the author to be racist. He speaks poorly of jews and blacks. In many ways, feels like hatred. He writes that immigrants from the caribbean basin or south and central america should be restricted from entering usa. Immigrants from europe, more specifically, northern europe...caucasians(male) should be allowed to immigrate. In his view, this would make usa a better country. I bought this book to find out more about the Illuminati, but after reading this book I'm not sure if what I've read is true. Instead of just stating the facts about the Illuminati,Mr.Krieg was biased in his writings. I will be purchasing another book about the Illuminati. I would've rather a refund, but I threw the book in the trash."
1,uuuuggghhh!,"This book really bothered me. But considering how Ms.Brockmann has written more great books then awful books, then I can forgive her for this one. First of all I did not like Alessandra, she got on my last nerve, maybe it's jealousy but maybe I should let all the romance authors know something about me. I HATE READING ABOUT WOMEN WHO ARE BETTER LOOKING THEN I AM! also, no offense or anything, but Harry was not my idea of a hero. I guess I am a little fickle but I want my romance men to be big, buff, and beautiful, and from my estimation Harry was none of those, he was interesting but did he have to be short, with a big nose, and a lawn mower haircut. Oh well I guess I'll read Heartthrob again and wait for Ms. Brockmann's next book. Just because I didn't like this one doesn't mean I won't read anymore of hers."
1,Amazon Prevents Resale of this DVD (and many other newer DVDs) by Buyers,"This is a great TV series and rated 5-stars for quality. But buyers be aware, Amazon lists this DVD as a RESTRICTED item, meaning its resale by you on Amazon is prevented. You are not allowed to sell this DVD and many other newer DVDS as a used DVD unless you are specially pre approved and Amazon is not approving new small sellers. Amazon is trying to eliminate its small home-based resellers. You can sell it on eBay."
1,good enough just to earn a star,"I was slightly disappointed in this game. Why? Well it was extremely short. Also, there weren't that many puzzles, as if Herinteractive is running out of ideas. I wish I could of sleuth around some more, there were so many places that we could of sleuth at. There were a lot of bugs in this game and now my computer is fool of patches that I loaded from Herinteractive. There were so many bugs, that I could hardly play the game. Next time, I think Herinteractive should spend a bit more time checking out for the glitches and all. But I got over that.The characters weren't as fun as they are in the other games.I wasted twenty dollars on a game that took me a day to beat.If you are really looking foward to spend twenty dollars, I wouldn't waste my money.. It was so easy. Almost too easy. Herinteractive makes very good games, but this one, wasn't as good as the others."
1,Only thing extraordinary is the body,"Just a news flash, theres nothing extraordinary about you. Your songs are bland and predictable. You wouldn't sell records if you werent so searing hot. But thanks for making me listen to your crappy song 50 times a day in the office!"
1,"Great Idea, Dull Book","If only a really special and interesting author had had the idea that Gregory Maguire had, to write a novel about the early years of the Wicked Witch of the West. Alas, the idea was had by Gregory Maguire, who seems to have a lot of really good ideas but no real idea of what to do with them.There are a lot of interesting ideas in Wicked, from recasting the Wizard of Oz as a Hitlerian Machiavellian political schemer and tyrant to having Glinda and the Wicked Witch be childhood pals. Unfortunately, the ideas remain ideas, and Maguire never makes the book take off into anything special or memorable.If Angela Carter had written this, it would have been an unforgettable adventure into fantasy, terrible and beautiful. Gregory Maguire takes a dazzling idea and makes it dull as dishwater. Quite simply, an ordinary novel about extraordinary events and characters."
1,Missing something,"I bought ""Take off your pants and jacket"" thinking it was going to be a great album like ""Dude Ranch"" and ""Enema of the state"". Boy was I wrong this album has nothing on it that stands out as a great song, eccept maybe ""The Rock show"" and "" Stay together for the kids"". I have4 four words for the blink fans. If you must have this album please buy it used because it really isnt worth the market price."
1,Could have been,"Could have been a fascinating and informative DVD...if it had not included the intertwined cultist views. As a researcher in psychology and neurotransmitters, there is some very facinating and informative pieces, but for the layman the potential effects of misleading pseudo-science is far to high."
1,horible worst thing in the world,i got it today it broke today garbage toy i hate it don't buy it ahhhhh please dont buy it please
1,TKD,Still trying to figure out where they came from. I've never seen these before and I did both WTF and ITF Taekwondo
1,The Worst Coen Brothers Movie Ever,"The Coen Brothers make 2 types of films: deeply symbolic humorous parables, and local-color humor-tinged melodramas. ""The Big Lebowski"" and ""The Hudsucker Proxy"" fall into the former category, while ""Fargo"" and ""No Country For Old Men"" fall into the latter. Unlike ""Fargo"", however, the plot of ""No Country..."" lacks any cohesion other than authentic-sounding local-color dialogue and it's excellent delivery by the film's performers -- all of which is ultimately meaningless, in the absence of a larger narrative context. Yes, the Bros.' fine production values are also well-displayed here, but overall this film feels like an empty exercise in attempting to recapture their previous brilliance."
1,Not Compatible - Returned for Refund,"Be forewarned - even though Kensington promotes this tip as compatible with LG cell phones, it's not compatible with all models. We have a UX355 and a UX245, and it doesn't work with either phone."
1,Lead Singer Disease,"Let's be frank: they blew all their good stuff for this record on ""Without You"", a fine, fine tune. The rest of the album is execrable. ""Primary"" is the only other worthwhile track, for obvious reasons. The music on some of these tracks is actually good and, for Van Halen, a departure from previous work. But it simply cannot get past Cherone's awful vocals (he was actually decent with Extreme... here he sounds like he's been drinking Sammy's tequila) and his even worse lyrics.Eddie complains about Lead Singer Disease... get a clue, dude, ditch the singers and make VH an instrumental trio. Mike and Alex have a very good groove together; let them work on good fundamentals so you can lay your guitar on top. I love listening to ""Baluchiterium"", for example. You guys needs to make an album of nothing but ear-popping rock, without some guy preening on the microphone. And forget about the damn ballads! They never worked for you!"
1,One thing you shouldn't do with your life:read this book,"I was very disappointed with this book.The title and theme really grabbed me. What you will read are the ramblings of several peoples current life stories that are boring and unhelpful. It is like Po searched out a bunch of aimless people doing strange things.The bookis no help for a typical middle class person or a blue collar worker trying to get a foot in a new door. I am tired of publishers publishing books that never arrive at any point or recommended solution. Like the readers are just blessed to be reading stlye, good English, and punctuation. Where are the solutions?Or at least be thought provoking.This book was neither."
1,Skateboarding is fun but not in this game.,"Pick one of the skaters and go skate in a street or vert place. Doesn't sound too good. Well, it isn't. The graphics are horrible (for obvious reasons, its GB color!) and tricks are limited. 4 verts, 3 streets. Just dont get this game."
1,by Anonymous,"If your intellect is in the range to accept a ""non-fiction"" work by Anonymous they you probably read anti-evolutions stuff from ""doctors"" with degrees from a bible college.""Anonymose"" is fine for fiction, think Henery Miller, or someone else who has a legitamate reason. It is not acceptable for a ""factual"" writer who wants to be taken seriously. While an ""anynymouse"" sorce is useless if a reader wishes to determine their objectivity, it is also usless to the author in concealing their identity unless the don't want to be paid. Calling themselves Anonymose is a marketing gimmick made so they can mainupate your tiny little minds.Enjoy"
1,just particle board,"This desk looks lovely on the website, but was an unfortunate disappointment when it arrived. Although advertised as ""oak,"" it is actually made in China of particle board. It arrived weeks late and heavily damaged. We saw the broken ""wood"" through the gaping hole in the box and just sent it back. The vendor ""Vision Decor"" is not available for contact on the weekend."
1,good minister,"Book is ok, a good start, but not a lot of meat, mostly a lot of water, beginner level faith, Ilike Robert, and will retain this book."
1,90 minutes of my life I'd like to have back,"I watched this movie on VCD. I grew up in Hongkong so I'm prepared for loud dialog and a silly plot. It's a story about 3 brothers and their quest for their mates. The oldest brother is married but is cheating on his homey but homely wife, who underwent a beautifying change after she leaves him. The second brother is an effeminate guy who's attracted to a very masculine woman. The third brother is a playboy who uses women like Kleenex. The part with the third brother losing his marbles after a bad fall, and the treatment after, is such absolute silliness and wasted the talents of the actors involved. This movie is good for a few laughs but... there are definitely better comedies out there."
1,standards are dropping,"I give this book one star and that only because it was late night reading before I was ready to nod off.This is pseudo cyberpunk meets the wild west. It should appeal to the gadget hungry Yugeo set, those who invent plots and tech where and when you get into a corner.Extropians and techies will love it because it has one of every possible idea once we find that we can download the human mind into a chip which is not much more than the portable media we carry on a watch chain today.Oh, yes, move over Bester, we can travel mentally into stored replacas or any other body where the chip has been removed.How does the author extend this story to over 500 pages? He watches the cartoon series shown on afternoon TV.Give Rambo access to James Bond's store of gadgets. Wind him up and turn him loose on some pseudo renegade mission, inventing subplots to keep Rambo on his carnage campaign and you have the story. Don't bother worrying about any substance; just revel in the carnage."
1,exqueeze me while I hurl because of this sorry game,"This game is so bad it makes me want to hurl. Thanks a pant-load, Chet, for this sorry excuse of a game. Wayne's World is ""not worthy"" of being on the SNES. No way? WAY!"
1,print quality issue,"Not too long after I printed several images on this HP paper, I noticed that the images with deep shadows had developed a solarization effect. On some images it developed within a few minutes, but on others, not for several hours (after I'd taken the time to frame the pictures, not amused!). I printed the same images on other papers and two different printers with no problems. I've reported the problem to HP and have asked for a refund, but they certainly aren't going to refund the cost of the wasted ink, and I wasted hours of time. DO NOT buy this paper!"
1,Disappointed in Stylus,I was very disappointed. Thought it would be heavier and mesh tip is lacking. Do not waste your money on this product.
1,Incomplete!!!!!!!,Since the package is easy to open....SURPRISE!!!.. the bacteria test was not there! I bought it for a Science Project for my son. What a dissapointment!
1,Weak Compared to Expo,"These markers produce a very faint line, almost like they are already dried out. I'm sending mine back. Don't waste your money on these and get the Expo brand."
1,TOTAL RIP OFF!!!,"After purchasing this item and getting charged about $40 AUS postage the DVD was not compatible with Australian DVD players. Conveniently you cannot return the product after it has been opened. As I could not test the DVD's compatibility until after I opened it, this return policy was no good to me. You are better off taking your chances with Ebay!!!"
1,Ruined by laugh track,"The comedy was ruined by the laugh track. Several times a minute, absurdly fake laughter and applause would be clumsily mixed in, then abrubtly faded out. The comedy might have had some interesting scenes without it; with it, the show is just annoying.Does anyone know what would possess a producer or director intentionally to ruin his own work like this? Even if they did like laugh tracks (does anyone?) this was one was incompetent to the point of parody."
1,POISION,"Toxic smelling! DO NOT EAT!!! Amazon will issue a prompt refund if it is bad, but do not attempt this product. They are very very rancid and smell of fumes and plastic. WILL MAKE YOU SICK!"
1,Do Not Buy - Get from Medela For Free!,"I followed the other reviewer's advice and called Medela's toll-free number to get this for free. I explained that I needed replacement tubes and the person was very nice and said, ""Just give me your address and we'll send you a pair for free"". It took just a few minutes and I got them in the mail a few days later."
1,Ancient and not extremely useful,"This book was written over 60 years ago, and its contents really show it. The condition of the book itself is terrible, and the pages smell like something out of my grandmother's attic. As far as the content itself, the pronunciation key is somewhat inaccurate and the writing system is not taught at all. The grammatical explanations are difficult to understand. I'd recommend you definitely skip this one and try ""Teach Yourself Nepali"" instead. You'll be glad you did."
1,Disappointed,I was disappointed in this CD. There are two guided meditations and only two songs; 4 tracks only. I did not think it was worth it.
1,The Last Book On Screenwriting you should EVER buy,"Read Kingseyeland's review for an accurate review of this book. I also flicked through the book at a bookstore. Let me say the title is very misleading. Aside from tips about how to sum up a film in a sentence (the log-line), the book didn't offer much. I also thought Snyder stuck the boot into the film Memento unfairly. Momento is mentioned in various film study books due to its creative editing and manipulation of narrative structure. Snyder's barbs just sounded bitter. Really, Snyder wrote (and freely admits to writing) ""Stop Or My Mom Will Shoot"". Is that the voice of wisdom? Log-line for this book: Old hack writer name drops incessantly and attacks independent films whilst offering little to no original information himself. Do yourself a favour and go and purchase a better book on this subject."
1,"Nice glasses, but the lenses falls out","When I bought these, I did not realize that the lens were replaceable, and now having used them, would not purchase them again. They are fine if you do not play any sports, but while windsurfing I took a fall, and when I got back up on the board, one of the lenses was gone. And worse yet, I was not even moving on the board when I fell, so don't think I was screaming across the bay.The lenses have also fallen out on me when I pick them up while driving. That truly annoys me as they are not so easy to get back in, and you are not sure they are truly back in.I did buy an extra set of lenses, but once gone, these glasses will find their way to the trash barrel."
1,Leaks Leaks Leaks Leaks,"This is the 2nd BrewStation I have owned. The first one began leaking at about 3 months. I dealt with it by placing a towel under it for a few months until the mess was just too much. I loved the press button to dispense feature, so I was trying to deal with it. I bought a 2nd BrewStation just recently and it too has begun to leak. The leak on both machines are in the carafe. It is the seam where the 2 plastic pieces meet. Like another reviewer stated this is a weak spot in this design. As much as I love the dispenser and the taste of the coffee, I am going to have to move on. I contacted Hamilton Beach and I can purchase a new carafe on my own dime, but the coffemaker is still NEW. I do not recommend this coffemaker to anyone unless you like to change out the towels underneath every hour or so. Don't leave for work with a relatively full pot or you will be mopping when you get home."
1,Boy I'm glad I'm finished reading this book,"No fancy verbiage here, only helpful info for other average, avid readers, that don't have bachelors, masters or PhDs in English or Literature, who read to relax and enjoy. Probably the majority of us.This book was extremely confusing and totally lacked continuity until the last dozen or so pages. Have you ever dropped your book and lost the page you were on, then picked it up and started reading in the wrong place? That's what it was like reading this book!So much space was wasted by the author displaying his vocabulary, and supersaturating the reader with descriptions that added little to the story.I am surprised by the high ratings by other reviewers."
1,The Most Boring Book I Have Ever Read,"The Pearl by John Steinbeck is one of the most boring books I have ever read. I had to read it in class, and I almost fell asleep whenever we read it. My advice- Do not buy this peice of Trash."
1,Misleading readings!!,"I must be the incredible growing and shrinking woman because according to this scale, I can lose and gain 10 lbs in a matter of minutes!I gave it 2 stars because the scale itself looks very nice; clean and sleek, but the quality is crappy. Its hugely inaccurate, giving a string of varying readings that vary widely.There is no point to having this scale if your desire is to monitor your weight. It will mislead you!"
1,Bad Service.,"I've previously written a bad review about DVDStore because I ordered the film Anarchists Cookbook on April 3rd. Almost a month later I still had not received the film, yet i was [....] short in my bank account. I was really counting on receiving the movie for a research paper for school. I wrote a pretty bad review speaking of the unreliability of the DVDStore. Soon after my review an associate of the DVDstore and promised me reimbursement for the film and two free movies to make up for the mistake and all I had to do is take down my bad review. Well, I took down my review and this representative of DVDStore stopped e-mailing me and it's been a week and I have yet to be reimbursed and he is no longer replying to my e-mails. To avoid further complications like this I will probably not go through DVDStore and I will not take down my review until I am given back the money I've wasted."
1,Dont waste your time.,"It is sad when a good ideal is not fully developed. This book is about a cav scout fighting in a fictious war in the future. Half the time I was reading it I was wondering just what was going on. It seemed all this guy did was ride around sand dunes and complain. The ""big picture"" is not developed. After reading the book I still dont have a clue as to why we were fighting and whom. Then there is the ""UFO"" part of the book. I wont give it away, but that part of the book was totally odd. This book could have been so much more. The author could have still used a fictious scenario, but beefed it up more and made it more believable."
1,Oscar's Book,"I bought this book to replace the copy I've had for many, many years, which has become extremely worn. I was dismayed to find that the book I received had been edited, whereas pages were omitted from the original version."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!,"I got this to hook up two desk top computers to my existing internet via ethernet cords, it does not work and will not configure for either computer, the power light comes on it is green and the dsl light comes on and is green, but the internet light does not come on at all and ITS JUST A WASTE OF TIME. Could have saved my money and just called my service provider to send my a new modem with 4 port ethernet and it would work."
1,this is a fraud,"The author is not even a board certified psychiatrist-forget about being a specialist. His extreme views has earned him severe condemnation from the court of law(has been called a ""he's a fraud or at least approaching that"" by a Judge in 1997)."
1,The Self Exam is the worst I have ran accross,"I started the book by taking the self exam. It is of such poor quality that I may not read the book fearing that it will be of equally poor quality. A few examples The port RIP uses is 1058, Maximum hop count in a RIP network is 7, RIP is a link state protocol."
1,Very Disappointed,"I really wanted to love this set-- the design is simple, yet elegant. We received the set as a wedding gift, but are pretty disappointed with them. Our main issue is that the end of the utensil is so heavy that it falls off the plate unless it has a piece of food attached to the end to balance the weight at the back. I can't understand why the manufacturer would weight the end so much heavier than the front. It's super annoying!"
1,Highly cliched and really not very funny,"Well, I'm not sure who the audiance for this movie might be but it sure isn't older, conservative folks. Highly cliched treatment of various characters and issues. I was expecting a bit more adventure and less silliness. Oh well, you win some and you lose some. I rate this as a big loss and waste of time."
1,USB didn't work,"I was looking forward to getting the transmitter because of the SD port. Well, the SD port was the only thing that was decent about it. It played good but the display did not read ""true"" ID3 tagging like it was advertised as having. It reads the name of the mp3 file - ONLY.The USB slot did not work at all. I tried a Lexar and a Sony. The lights on the drives lit up but the display on the transmitter did not change and it did not play any music at all.The other bad thing about this is the display does not work (and not supposed to) at all with an mp3 player!If you read the ""fine print"" - about the display feature, it says ""when available"". I guess I am expecting too much out of a $50 technical item.I'm sure one day, another company will come up with something like this that will work and advertise everthing accurately without any hidden statements."
1,Worst 007 Movie Ever,This was the worst Bond movie we have ever watched. My husband loves 007 movies; he almost fell asleep. I was so bored I felt physically ill and left the room. Boring...
1,Great Single,"This ""reunion"" album provides the NO.1 hit ""Lonely Days""...and there's no denying that it's a wonderful song. But there aren't too many other highlights here. Most of the songs seem to be leftovers from the Brother's unsuccessful and shortlived solo careers. The title track is an exception with Robin apparently recounting his ""Two Years"" away from his siblings. The recording itself sounds muddled and not up to the standards even at that time. One of their weaker efforts."
1,very weak,"We showed this to students to show them what not to do(seriously). It is that bad. If you do hapkido do not waste your money, if you don't, do not let this be the example of what hapkido is."
1,Blu-Ray has known issues.,I really can't review the blu-ray because even after updating the firmware on my Samsung player this disc just displays black screen. Several members at the Blu-Ray forums have stated Sony players can not play this disc either or will do so with skipping and stuttering issues. Avoid like the plague.
1,AAAGH,I just finished watching this and......it's all true....I didn't believe it but....it's all true........oh god......stupid stupid stupid of me.......my brain is melting....I....I......lhglsrknjvg.jdz;m/fh bmlnj
1,Condition of book was most disappointing.,"I have read portions of this book before and wanted my own copy. When this specific book arrived I was stunned that it had been described as in ""good"" condition. The cover was worn with stains on it as well. I would have preferred a more honest description so I would anticipate a worn and soiled book. Not happy with my purchase."
1,Curbed Pulling But Bruised My Pit,"This was recommended to me for my rambunctious pitbull who pulls me more than I pull him. It did make waking him much easier but in turn it rubbed his skin raw and he has bruises. I changed him to his old harness. Still looking for something that does make it easier to walk him without hurting him in the process. If it hadn't hurt him, I would have rated it 5 stars."
1,Masquerading as Angels,"A good book, but not one of my favorites. I read a lot of these kinds of books and this one is just so/so."
1,Not very good at all,I got this unit cheap. $150 for a 80gb + DVD Burner. Sounds good. But you DO get what you pay for. I have a JVC that cost me $400 and it has a 160GB harddrive and DVD Burner and it's Much better than this unit. It's hard to program and the killer part is it LOSES programs that was recorded!!!! This is not reliable at all. I have missed so many ending to shows it's not even funny any more. It's so upsetting to watch 50min of a hour long show and miss the ending/punchline/outcome. I would give it 1 star if not for the price.
1,would never buy again!,"I used this product for a year and a half and felt as though it was filled with weed growth! The more I sprinkled the faster my weeds grew. Would not buy this product again. Was so happy to see ""organic"" weed preventer but this product drove me so crazy I am thinking of using some good old fashioned chemicals."
1,crappy construction,"The right pedal should be reverse threaded so it doesn't unscrew itself as the child rides. It's not, so you have to make sure you put the right pedal in tight. The left pedal will tighten itself naturally as you ride. Any decent bicycle is designed with a reverse threaded right pedal. Also, the front headset is only a piece of nylon plastic. There are no ball bearings. This bike will last one kid, but won't make it to any antique markets. You get what you pay for. Otherwise, it works and my son loves it. I wouldn't buy it again."
1,Remix should be sold as such.,"Solar Flow is a fine dvd, but should not be marketed as something separate from Yoga Shakti. There are no new sequences, just remixes of the Shakti sequences. Since you can rearrange all the Shakti sequences on your own, Solar Flow is superfluous. I don't feel a lot of shanti being swindled into purchasing the same thing twice. A little disclosure please!-Rebecca"
1,Disappointing,"I found this unit useless. I found it impossible to adjust so that I could see the road behind and when I held it in place I could not easily focus on the road behind. There may be a better way to adjust it, but the instructions don't tell you how."
1,Revisions Are Tolerable,"What is inexcusable is Lucas's refusal to give the original, untainted trilogy a full restoration and hi-definition release. The sanctity of Star Wars has long been forfeit. All that's asked is that the integrity of the originals be preserved amid the abortive atrocities that Star Wars has come to represent."
1,There's a sucker born everday!,PT Barnum would be proud. Now all I am supposed to do is think good thoughts and concentrate on getting rich and it will happen if I really believe. Yeah right. I'd be happy for my $20 bucks back (I didn't really buy it I skimmed it in the library). If you are gullible enough to buy this book well then you deserve what you get. Did the last self help book you bought help you? Or the one before that? If they did why are you even thinking about this trash? If they didn't why are you even thinking about this trash? Oh and the secret to getting wealth is hard work. Don't be a dope.RMW
1,A silly juvenile film. A pseudointellectual piece of nonsense.,Whoever made this film is obviously trying to impress upon the viewer the idea that artists are deep complex people. But all I see in the film are low life drug addict losers who sit around (few of them seem to have jobs) and party all day. The main character (Sid) is a pseudointellectual who claims she majored in Critical Theory in college (ultra liberal nonsense which has the goal of undermining Western Culture to pave the pathway for Marxism). The film appeals to naive youth.
1,We own this book at work. It is useless.,"All of the developers at our location use this book. On a scale of 1-10, we ALL give it a 1. The index leaves out references to portions of the software and the amount of help is superficial. If there were another book on the market we would buy it. This book was a waste of money."
1,disappointing,"this product should have been lots of shots and sounds of other cats, for lonely bored cats to play with, instead it is mostly mice in cages, fish in tanks,and toys...."
1,Waste of money,"I had expected something interesting from Moonwalking - when in fact this video is quite crappy. DO NOT waste your money. Seems as if this video was made to show all how different he was and did not emphasize the person he truly was- a humanitarian who loved all and cared about the human condition. In addition, there is minimal footage of Michael Jackson. I'd have to say in total there's probably less than 4 minutes of footage of him on the ""entire"" DVD. This also comes with a small book of which I haven't read - but after seeing the video, I do not have the desire to do so. I repeat: DO NOT PURCHASE DO NOT PURCHASE DO NOT PURCHASE!!"
1,"No complete season, = no sale","So, yet another random ""collection"" instead of the complete seasons, huh? Testing the waters again, are we, studio execs? Well... TENSHUN!We want the WHOLE tamale, boys! That's right, Phil Silvers was an American original - the Top Banana, baby! He deserves the full treatment - deluxe all the way! All the seasons, all the episodes, in all their crowning glory! Otherwise, forget it! Now go out there, you fancy studio dudes, and do it over again properly!Hey UP!"
1,Too Much Information,"Just got this today and started reading it, has a lot of information that really has nothing to do about actually playing a guitar, so right now I would say that this was a waste of my money. Also the disc that comes with it is a cd disc(audio only) I was looking for something more along the lines of a show and tell presentation. Personally if I had gone to a book store or library and visually inspected this book first, it would still be on their shelf."
1,I gave up at page 112,"This book has a very confused time line. I read the book up to page 112 and the author only talks about Mussolini and Hitler's relationship, the Italian and German Generals and the politics. There is only implied mention of what is going on with the Allies and I don't remember Patton or Montgomery being mentioned in the first 112 pages.The book would probably appeal to someone who wanted to know the details of the politics going on inside Italy and between Italy and Germany. I was looking for a more comprehensive description of events with a single continuous timeline."
1,"Rambling, should have been a short story","As described by the editorial review, this is ""physically a narrow book"" akin to a short story. I listed while driving on a long road trip, with nothing else to listen to, so I persisted, thinking the story must get to the point. The exploration of a former highschool athlete who doesn't make the big time could have been well done within the length of a real short story. Instead, very little was dragged out to create a book, that sells on the Grishom name. I've lost faith in what has become the Grishom book mill."
1,broke down after 12 days but got another that's great,"It worked great until yesterday when, after 12 days of use it wouldn't shut off, and now it won't turn on, it's kaput.This is an update, I got a new one that works fine, we are very happy with it now."
1,Very difficult to install,I have used Adaptec products in the past and did not expect to have problems installing the USB 2.0 2 Port Cardbus Adaptor. The instructions directed me to the Adaptec website for the Windows XP driver which I carefully followed the instructions to install on my Sony Vaio laptop. The result was a locked up computer which could only be resolved by disconnecting the battery as the keyboard and mouse no longer worked. I used System Restore to back out of the corrupted driver. I went through the installation process again and again the system crashed. I will return the product and purchase a different adaptor.
1,Worst seat ever,This car seat is great as long as it is not in a car- Once this seat was installed in our car by the local fireman we could not get to the tighten/loosen knob located on the side of the chair. The design is horrible- with the knob on the lower side- it is impossible to move- and I tighten and loosen ever time I put the baby in and out of the seat.I would not recommend this seat to anyone. We ended up returning the seat to Babies R Us and buying a second Britax.
1,Cheaply Made,Both thumbs had small rips at the base and the fingers had threads that were already unravelling. Spend a little more for better quality.
1,Ridiculous Price for a SINGLE Glue Stick,"I think the seller is deliberatly trying to deceieve people into thinking they are getting 10 glue sticks when in fact, your getting ONE glue stick.Who would buy JUST ONE glue stick anyway?I added this to my wish list months ago, and when I ordered it, I didn't read the comments."
1,Complete Waste of Money,"I purchased this cart at Target and had to exchange it within one week as I lost one of the wheels in the parking lot and didn't realize it was missing until I entered our building! Someone found the ""missing"" wheel and left it in the lobby.The front wheels of the 2nd cart ""shredded"" and finally fell off completely some time ago; but even though we bought a different cart from a hardware store, my husband hated to acknowledge defeat and had been using the disabled cart to load groceries from the car. I finally got rid of the cart away and got a new one."
1,How dare you!!!!!!!,"How dare Mark Ebner diss the school that I go to, Crossroads! You have no decency! You probably didn't even go there yourself! I was actually enjoying this book until I came across that chapter.Go f*ck yourself."
1,FICTION--all FICTION!,"Lynn is a wonderful fictional writer, and it's a shame she can't admit all her books are fictional stories. Close friends of her former Native American boyfriend, David Carson, known for his wonderful Medicine Cards and many other wonderful books, stated everything Lynn learned about the medicine way was taught by his grandmother in Santa Fe, not the fictional Native American characters in her books. Shame on you, Lynn, for deceiving so many people out there and shame on the greedy publishers who continued to publicize her books as non-fiction!"
1,poor for beginner,"The book has two CDs but only little audio files. The reading is also too fast for beginners who want to learn to speak Mandarin. If you are a beginner, do not buy this book. If you want the audio CDs to contain more in the chapters, you will want to skip this book."
1,Read the KJV please.,"This bible is not the true GOD'S Word. It has been changed too much. I believe that the KJV is the true Bible. God died for our sins. He shed his blood so that we might have everlasting life - but, ONLY if we belive. This bible is written to make you feel good about yourself. All we are sinners destined for hell and damnation. God was not brought into this world just to make us feel good about ourselves but to make us feel a need to repent from our sin. We cannot get to heaven in eternity unless we believe in the LORD JESUS CHRIST."
1,Superman Fan. . .but not a fan of this book,"For Tomorrow, Vol. 1 was fairly decent. . .I was looking forward to Vol. 2 very much. But then, when I finally picked it up and started reading it, I didn't get more than halfway through--essentially, right around the point where the reason for the disappearances is revealed. I idly flipped through the rest of the book, and it didn't get any better. A disappointingly BAD Superman story."
1,A silly romance novel,"Girls who are sophomores in high school might like this book, but I had to give it up after a couple of chapters. Just plain silly. Shallow and giggly. I have been fooled into buying this author's books before, but never again."
1,LOOKS LIKE AN OLD STAG MOVIE,"A very cheap, and crude, movie, even by 1930s standards----only reason professional critics and others rave about this junk is because a famous director made it.This is, basically, a silent movie---a couple years after THE JAZZ SINGER.HORROR OF DRACULA, from terrance fisher, is a million times better, though fisher isn't the respectable celebrity like the director of this junk that pretentious movie fans admire."
1,Yuck--such horrible language,I bought this book because we had read a newly published book by the same author and enjoyed it very much. Not sure why the author felt inclined to inject this novel with such crudity. Stopped reading after the first few pages.
1,Great game; wish it worked,"I have played this game a little bit at my friends house and loved it, so I figured what the hell. I went to the store and bought the platinum pack with all the booklets and the extra mission pack cd and everything. I get home and install it- it installs beautifully. My computer is a new p4 2.2 256 Ram with an okay video card, and that was far exceeding the box recommendations. I got into the game menu and begin the missions and right as I press the button to start the action, my computer completely shuts down. I don't know why it does it- I have well over the recommendations. Buy this game if you really hope that it will work- mine regretfully didn't."
1,Burn Fat Fast-- but only if you insist,"I recently purchased Denise Austin's Burn Fat Fast Cardio Dance and Sculpt video. As with The Dance It Off video, I found the moves too complicated, too stressful upon my joints and too annoying to follow. In addition, the cameraman/woman seemed to have a peculiar fixation with the jiggly breasts of one of the dancers. Top if off with the fact that my body refused to cooperate with my mid-life brain and you won't be surprised that this video ended up in the same place as the Dance It Off video. The Landfill. Why? Because it didn't deserve the honor of being recycled."
1,..And the winner is...The MARKETING DEPARTMENT!,"Yes, she's beautiful. Yes, she's talented. All the things a marketing department needs to sell anything from hub caps to shark skin socks. And in this case, a CD with something they call music.I love music. I make music. I listened to the CD and nothing inspired me to want to ever hear it again. I guess I was expecting more. More GRAMMY material. Besides ""Fallin"", nothing grabbed my attention.Sorry, Alicia. Not hatin' on you, just NOT feeling you.Get Jill Scott, India.Arie...anybody."
1,This is the worst book I've ever read.,"I would not recommend this book Summer of the Monkeys toanyone. It is not that great. I kept on losing interest in it. Itisn't that good. I think it's too long and too hard. The boy and hisdog are trying to catch the monkeys and keep failing to catchthem. They use old slang like ""my dog and me."" It's a horriblebook. END"
1,It looks good.,The only good thing I can say about this is that it looks good. This is the worst money I have ever spent for anything. The first time I attempted to use it I knew I had bought a piece of junk. The mechanism stuck and I had to stop and try to adjust the lever. The multiple sifter did not let the flour through. A complete waste of money!
1,Great...in theory.,"I have to agree with the reviews that say it looks nice and hold the brushes well...but it rusted almost immediately. I'm also not a fan of the accumulation of gross water that it catches. Very disappointing, especially at this price."
1,Piece of junk !!,I had to do some modifications to the pieces in order to put it together. The quality of the items is horrible!!
1,Pressure rating not stated,They should indicate the pump pressure rating. This is a very low pressure pump which for my needs is totally useless. I wasted my money.
1,Over rated,"I bought this machine with the highest of hopes. It worked well, not great for two months. Then it stopped working. There is only one place in the US that is qualified by Harmon Kardon to repair it. They are in California and not cheap. After repair costs and shipping I could have bought another DVD player. I bought my Mother a [less expensive] DVD player for X-mas. It had equal quality and more features. Plus if it breaks after two months I'm only out [$$]."
1,Don't waste your time,"This film is grabageHellraiser - Doug Bradley = Epic Failthis is what clive barker stated about the filmIf they claim its from the mind of Clive Barker, it's a lie. It's not even from my butt-hole."
1,Hard to eat,"They are very pretty- look like real pearls. But they are very hard and I'm afraid to use them on my cupcakes. Don't want anyone to break a tooth on these! Seller was prompt, and the photo is exact."
1,Not convinced this stuff does anything,"All I know is that it uses up a lot of propane, and it doesn't seem to catch all that many mosquitoes. It does catch them, but I'm not sure if it actually makes any difference."
1,"If Passport books could get less than a 1, I'd give them a -1!!","You think the Chinese book is full of errors, you should see the other passport book, Just Enough Japanese. Both of these books were supposedly translated by doctors of whatever. (They obviously don't have a doctrine in linguistics, especially the asian languages.)These books are so full of not only errors when it comes improper translation of a phrase, but it's also full of pronounciation errors! The Chinese and Japanese books are a waste of money. I wouldn't pay 50cents for them. I'm glad my bookstore took them back without issues. I couldn't see throwing away $10 on nonsense.Avoid these passport books, at least on Japanese and Chinese."
1,"Reviews paperback book, not content","I have heard great reviews of this author from friends, so I set out to buy one of her books. The paperback version of this book is so offensively ugly no one should buy it. The type bleeds so the letters are fuzzy, and the overall impact is negative. I haven't looked at the hardbound version, but don't buy the paperback version - get it from the library if you want to read this book. No publisher should get away with this kind of product. No author should put up with it, and no reader should buy it."
1,"Mis-advertised , by ""someone""! How do you assign ""0"" stars?","Given the purchase of a new Samsung cell phone (SGH-A707) from Cingular, this should be an ideal accessory for my Kensington PowerBook charger. Wrong! The M-5 tip is too large (by several mm) to mate with tiny port on this model phone."
1,There are no miracle cures,"Be wary, my friends. If following a diet could cure or control MS, there would not be sick people around."
1,"Complex, and Hard to Read","I found the new version of Please Understand Me to be hard to read, written in a very academic language. What made this book very easy to understand was a companion title I purchased called Understanding Yourself and Others, An Introduction to Temperament, by Linda V. Berens, Ph.D.. This book simplified the ideas in Please Understand Me II, but did not lose the richness of the concepts. I recommend purchasing it with Please Understand Me II, it is only $4.95."
1,"Leaks, lite brite","I have had several humidifiers in my day, and this is the worse. Like other reviewers have pointed out, this unit leaks on the floor--design flaw. Also, the lite is brite! It is kind of cool looking, but too bright at night."
1,Not the classic I hoped for,"When I first decided to read Rendezvous with Rama, I anticipated a classic science fiction novel that I would enjoy. Instead I eagerly flipped page after page to find out in the end I was very dissapointed with the book. This book offers plenty of questions and never gives any answers which left me wondering why I bothered reading it. If your looking for a great science fictions novel, Rendezvous with Rama is not it."
1,"Says Circular Polarizer, but is not","This appears to be just a ND filter in a polarizer ring. I have tried several ""tests"" (Viewing LCD screen and turning, looking through polarized sunglasses and turning, looking to the sky 90 degrees from the sun and turning. Nothing changes. A cheapo CPL for a smaller lens darkens and changes the polarization. I though tiffen was supposed to be a top notch company, but guess not."
1,So Disappointed,"When i first heard about the book i could not wait to get a copy. my sister bought one for me and for herself. When i got through the first few chapters I could not read anymore. I felt that it was so poorly written, vague and I could see that her message was clear: you had a bad childhood, now move on. Wow, just like that. she seems to think that if one person acts a certain way it has something to do with their childhood. i don't think she understands the pain and how a bad childhood REALLY shapes your mind."
1,dont take it! im in pain right now!,"so glad i read these reviews. been taking this supplement for two days... have felt awful!! upset stomach, abdominal pains!!! will never take again!!!"
1,toy printer,"The Epson picture mate does a good job of printing anything 4 x 6. It is the only size it prints no matter what the size of your image. If you seriously want to print photos, this is not the printer for you. If you want to play with some photos, this will work."
1,Hokey and intense,"I also have the tai chi for beginners and chi kung. This does not have the same relaxed style, music, and scenic backdrops. Shot in a studio. I was looking for something as a next step to the tai chi but was not ready to stand on my head as in the warmup to this video. Also, has the intensity and bravado of a chinese action movie, not the relaxed instruction style from the other videos that i was looking for."
1,Could not finish ...,"Okay, I REALLY tried, but put the book down at 200 pages. It is TEDIOUS, repetative (in desperate need of further editing) and no matter what I did, I could not find an ounce in me to care about even one character in this book. The characters are so unlikeable, I no longer cared what the outcome was. Also, all the ""darker nation"" and ""paler nation"" stuff really was tiresome and over-used. I'm in an interracial relationship and my partner and I both thought that was just bizarre. And he didn't really say anything new or interesting about the law academic scene. I know there was something important in there he was ""trying"" to say about race, especially the elite African American society, but I did not care enough to find out. Good luck those who forge through this."
1,dissapointed..:-(,"I bought this thing at Target for $60, came home tested it.....and it sucks!I read the booklet that it came with before using it, however the salsa still came soupy, and the banana-strawberry smoothie was not that great. I decided to return it before getting more frustated and feeling rip off by this product.I really don't recommend it."
1,Board books are supposed to be for babies,"I am a fan of the larger Pigeon books, so I bought this one for my 18 month old who loves books. This was a disappointment as the play on words at the end makes little sense to a baby. This is a waste of money. The longer books are much more enjoyable."
1,It;s just OK.,"Read through the reviews and this specific pottery wheel looked promising. It's cute, but not worth the cost. The motor just isn't strong enough to be used properly."
1,Simply not as good,"It is tough when your 5 year old observes that ""they don't make games like they used to."" Atari has slowed Pajama Sam down to the point of tedium. The gameplay is very slow and no longer features the ability to skip scenes already played through by use of the ESC key. This leads to a lot of staring at the screen waiting for something to happen or rote repetition that is no fun for anyone. Shame."
1,Not worth it!!!!,"I purchased this for use with my Ipod Classic and my Blackberry Curve. Getting it to pair was the easy part. What was most problematic is that unless the Bluetooth Adapter D650 for the Ipod was within a line of sight of the headphones, the music cut in and out. Very disappointing. Even having the ipod in my front pocket while wearing the headset, I experienced problems with a steady stream of music. After 15 minutes, I decided I could live with the hassle of a corded pair of earbuds without bluetooth stream interruption!"
1,I agree completely with another reviewer.,"""A story of conflict between the Welsh and English invaders."" This reviewer described this book to a ""T."" I can't describe it better, so read her review. I however didn't enjoy it as much as she did. I would really give it only a 1 1/2*"
1,YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR,FOUR MOVIES FOR LESS THAN $10.00.THESE ARE DOUBLE SIDED DVD'S.THE VIDEO IS VERY COMPRESSED AND THE SOUND IS NOT VERY GOOD.THEY WILL NOT UPGRADE TO 1080.BUT THEY WERE CHEAP!!
1,It was not what I needed,"I was looking for a commentary that a lay person could understand and use, but this commentary did not meet my needs. The sender did an excellent job in getting the book here and everything; however, the content of the book was not as helpful as what I had hoped."
1,Major problem with clouding,"After 3 exchanges, I'm looking elsewhere. A TV in this price range should NOT have this defect (which appears to be wide spread). The XBR 40"" apparently has the same problem."
1,Ripstik Board,"I purchased this board for my 20 year daughter's birthday, hoping she could use it to get around her campus with it. I was first looking into standard skate boards but choose this after reading in the reviews how easy and fun the Ripstik was. Well, after 2-3 days of attempting to stay on she has given up. She bikes and snow skis so it is not like she is not athletic. Therefore, I would caution against buying it for someone unless you are sure they will be able to ride on it. Alas it will be gathering dust in my garage!"
1,Out of date,"After some guy on a Web site recommended this book, I went and bought it. Frankly, I'm disappointed. Were there pages missing or did old Mike forget about SQL Agent? With SQL Server 2000 on the street, much of what you see here is old hat. Current books cover SQL 2000. This one doesn't. For a guy that apparently spends more time on the newsgroups than he does actually using the product, the self-important style is inappropriate. Go and earn your stripes, Mike."
1,I was shortchanged. NOT 2.2lbs - this is a 2lb can!!!,"Product itself is top notch! Great polish, works well, very expensive but worth it - HOWEVER - Amazon item description states that this is a 2.2lb can - the can that arrived was 2oz short, only 2.0lbs - considering Amazon sells a 1.7oz tube for almost $10 - I feel VERY shortchangedShipping package was inadequately padded - the metal can arrived totally dented up and I'm amazed it didn't burst open in transit."
1,"Junk, may be okay for point and shoots but too flimsy for a DSLR","Great idea, but I bought one of these and was highly disappointed with it, it's cheaply made in China. It will probably work well enough with a lightweight point and shoot camera, but a DSLR is way too heavy for this mount. The small ball tightening screw cannot be tightened enough to hold a DSLR steady. Save yourself both time and aggravation and buy a solidly built rugged unit like ones from Manfrotto or Bogan. They may cost a lot more, but they're worth every penny of it."
1,Not made to last,"My daughter enjoys this book. However, we have other books that have lift flaps that she loves. In this book the flaps are VERY flimsy and tear very easy. The first thing that happened was she pulled of the covers for the ears."
1,House Atreides,The sublety and dark complexity of the original Dune novels is absent here...the clumsiness and cliche apparent in this book made it a sad disappointment. Only the names remain the same... do yourself a favor and read Dune again.
1,Order all you need with the first order as the shipping charges with the second order is a shocker,"My first order of 3 cost a total of $13 with shipping. When I proceeded to order another 3 the total cost with shipping jumped to $39. Not worth it, will go else where."
1,The Worst Teach Yourself Book,"This is by far the worst teach yourself book I have ever read. Irish is a very beautiful language but it has very difficult pronunciation, you have to practice for months before you can predict the pronunciation of a word. This book has a pronunciation section with cassettes, you hear a word said by a native speaker, but you have no idea how it's written, it is not in the book!!! The book is a complete disorder in this section. The Grammar explanations are a joke too.I have used very good TY books like TY Czech, Hindi, Finnish, Hungarian, Sanskrit, Danish, Russian, Dutch, or modern Greek; and very bad ones like TY Romanian or Polish; but this is the worst so far. This book is amazingly far, far below TY standards."
1,Disappointing texture,"I love shea butter and switched to this brand from the more expensive Pre de Provence brand because this was cheaper. However, I'm disappointed in the grainy texture, and the product separates with a film of oil floating on the top. Maybe my product is defective??? I live in a very mild climate and my house temperature stays in the sixties to the eighties at times. The graininess is always there. The extra time it takes to keep the product in my hand or rub it on heels/elbows in order for the grains to melt, is not worth it. There's no way I can use it as a general skin moisturizer because of the graininess. Will be going back to the other brand as it's truly creamy."
1,Yes ripped off.,"I think you could make a drinking game of attempting to match scenes in this movie to Alien and Aliens. Fronm the grainy footage of a derelict spacecraft and people asking ""what is that?"" to the chest burster scene, to the person peering through a ceiling tiles, to the marine that goes crazy, to the large gun attached to the waist, the list goes on and on. It's almost worth watching to see how many ""matches"" you can make."
1,"Author needs to travel more, read more books","I enjoyed ""Dreams of Trespass"" the author tries to follow it up with a book written on her book tour. This ends up being a disaster, this is the writers first trip to the West, her history, and knowlegde of the West is zero. She spent her childhood school years just memorizing the Koran. Despite her degrees in history, her history of the West is very poor. When introduced to the writngs of Kant, she assumes that he is still a role model on the philosophy of women in the western world.The saddest part is when she writes about her collegue Kemal, no matter how much he abuses her verbally, she always crawls back for his approval, while trying to tell us how liberated she is.I feel sorry for all her fears, and she has many, having crossed roads, that thank god, I didn't have to cross.So give this book a skip, hopefully the author made enough money on it to travel a bit more and read alot more before she writes another book about the West"
1,Obviously NOT George,"...Any body who has EVER heard George Harrison's voice can tell that it isn't him... And if the voice was taken from a cassette, why does it sound like it was recorded in a fancy studio? ...Anywho, it's really badly made in any csae. Any real Beatles fan won't get through the whole thing without HAVING to turn it off."
1,"Good, but...","I've owned 3 pair of these shoes. Comfort is great, good support, roomy toe box and easy to get on and off. But the soles and heel crack and split long before the leather uppers show wear. The inside lining material wears and becomes shabby quickly. I would pay twice the price for better quality for a longer wear. The design is great but the material inside and the sole/heel is inferior. I'd buy again IF the price reflects the material quality."
1,Didn't Work For Me,"I suffer from arthritis pretty badly in my hands, especially the fingers, and I decided to give this a try because of the anthocyanins and their purported efficacy in treating RA, or at least alleviating some of the pain. However, unlike some of the other reviewers here, I noticed no change in my pain, even after two months. Maybe I should have given it a longer trial, but pain is pain, and because I gained absolutely no relief for it, I have since moved on to trying other things."
1,EAT YOURSELF THROUGH THE CITIES IF YOU CAN FIND THEM.,"For a book on travel, it seems that the index would be from the viewpoint of (in this order) State; City, Restaurant. In this book if you are in Podunk, Somewhere you can't find it in the index unless you know the name of the restaurant.More ""out-of-city"" locations would have been preferable.In the text, list the State, City and restaurant with maybe one or two lines of description with a rating code.Sorry, I was't impressed and am returning the book."
1,Pure Trash,This book was written by two individuals with an obviously tainted agenda.I bought this book and returned it the same day!Disney fans look elsewhere!
1,Oh Dear,It works well for a few small areas. Forget about legs/chest...its WAY too much work. It was really messy and painful too.
1,Not the best product I have seen on the market,This product came with rough edges that should have been machined off. It looked sloppy.
1,How do you know which series you'd actually receive?,The title is from a different series than the cover is from. Who knows what you'd receive if you bought it?
1,Don't waste your money on this garbage!!,"This CD totally BLOWS! Having lived in Bahia I am very familiar with samba de roda, samba do fundo de quintal etc. and I can assure you that this is a piece of crap...all the tracks on this cd are IDENTICAL!!! Thats right, only the lyrics are different but the music (which is mediocre) is actually the same for every track. In short: A HUGE RIP-OFF...Be warned!!"
1,Written more for adults than children,"I was looking for a book that would help a child if he or she was lost in the woods - how to make a shelter, a fire, etc. This was written for an adult to use with a child. I wanted something written for a child who was about eleven or twelve."
1,Deception at it's best,"When you read this book, be sure and check his sources. Remember what you have learned in school about argument from improper authourity. Most of Mr. Lomborg's sources are not from accepted scientific sources but are mostly ancedotal stories in non scientific articles, etc. Then he accepts and rejects the same sources as needed to support his arguement. Many of the supporting reviews of this book have accepted what the author has said at face value. All I ask is for everyone who reads this book to make sure what you see is what you get."
1,will not play on sony blu ray,"Great package soon to be a dissapointed boy, sat down with a beer and the comic book pressed play on the sony blu ray remote and nothing player froze had to removepower to get the disc out. Checked for fimware updates none pending.Anybody else with this problem, should go get the turn table out?"
1,Definitley not peanut butter,"If you are looking for something that tastes like peanut butter, this is not it. If you are looking for a lower calorie, lower fat substitute to put on a sandwich, etc. then it will do. Be prepared for a whole new flavor - it is an acquired taste."
1,Those who know don't tell....,Those who know don't tell. And those who tell don't know. Enough said.
1,"Great idea, laughable recipes","I read through this book for fun. As an African, many of the recipes have, well, quite obviously not been made by the author but instead garnered from others, errors and all. Which is why she suggests that Nigerians make eba with palm oil... ah. no, no they don't... I doubt they actually incorporate the oil into cassava... not sure how that would work... these and other little quirks made the book funny in a laughable kind of way, but not practical... or accurate really. I do appreciate the idea, and hope a real African who has lived on the continent can make a good cookbook showing different recipes from all over the continent (as herculean a task as that would be) Also, lots of typos... not sure how that's possible in a cookbook...but it happened. Long story short, this is a good book to impress your friends with if you're not African and want to show how diverse your interests are. If you are African, this is a good book to have a laugh at with other Africans."
1,Very 90s-type independent movie with little value,"First off, it was in the comedy section of Amazon streaming. It's definitely NOT a comedy.Second, it's very dark and twisted, edited very slowly, and has little redeeming value.The only good thing about it is that David Hyde Pierce played a screwed up character very well. But it's directed and edited so badly that doesn't redeem the film at all."
1,Cheap for a reason,"This does not come with a chain. That is stated in the description, but I did not notice that when I ordered it, so that's something to be aware of. There is significant discoloration inside the locket, which would be mostly hidden by any photographs placed in it. The thing that I am displeased about is that the photograph of this pendant clearly shows the stone in the middle as being pink. The stone is not pink at all; it is a dark purple. The only nice thing I have to say is that I was pleased that the company shipped this to me quite rapidly."
1,Re-charge malfunction,"Initially, this unit worked very well and I found it to be extremely convenient. However, after only a week of use, it stopped accepting a charge. The unit comes with an AC adapter as well as a USB adapter. Neither would charge the headset. As a result, it no longer works. A week of use - you gotta be kidding! After researching this issue online, I learned that others have experienced this problem with the BT500 unit. I won't be buying another one."
1,As Good As It Gets: Music from the Motion Picture,Only a few good songs. Few songs were like elevator music. No James Morrison. I bought it cheap so I am glad I didn't spend a lot of money for it.
1,More silly conservative agitprop,"Let's deconstruct the book's synopsys:""On one side are those who defend family, faith and traditional values. On the other side are those who aggressively reject any hint of tradition or religion and want a society based on secular values. ""Manichean dualism at its most stark. The ""good"" ""Christians"" (heirs to the defenders of slavery, genocide of the OT, colonialism, etc.) want to keep the game going. The ""bad"" guys want to see an end put to this hypocrisy.""James Dobson and Gary Bauer say that both value systems cannot co-exist.""Because they are at heart religious bigots.""And the one that prevails will control the hearts and minds of America's children.""Because they hate the idea that America's children might, ahem, think for themselves."
1,Overrated,"I really don`t think that this film is going to be a classic one.I think it`s not scary enough,and personally in comparison with other movies like gothika or the exorcist i would`nt choose it.OK some scenes may be cool but,from this movie,i expected much more.don`t spend your money on it ,unless you don`t find something better"
1,Awful mish-mash of eco-trip-crap,"This disk is truly as bad as Nitin's previous disks were wonderful. Take any previous Nitin disk, throw in some Alpha, a bit of Craig Armstrong, some predictable eco-freindly american diatribe, mix until extremely smooth and you have a prophesy. As with most prophesies there no good news about it. My prophesy is that anyone who buys this won't ever buy another Nitin disk"
1,no hi-def transfer...boo!,"I read that this won't be formatted for widescreen, and will be put into a full frame mode, despite being broadcast in widescreen on ABC. Disney, time to join the 21st Century! Until then count me out on purchasing what should have been the best TV series to hit DVD ever! Very disappointed :-("
1,YET ANOTHER double dip,"How many times can the same movie be re-released? There is no justification for this other than to grab more money from fans' pockets (and of course to tie-in with the past-its-prime 6th Rocky flick coming out). I bought the original Rocky DVD box set, because I am a fan of the series. Then there was the second set that miraculously appeared with ""improved video"" or whatever. Now, Rocky is rererereleased in a 2-disc version, and the second box set is being rererererererereleased. WHEN WILL IT END? When will one release of a movie be the final one? I'm tired of the big ""screw you"" to fans."
1,Music Man Where Are You?,"OK, I'm curious about Music_Man and why he singled my review out? Did he not see other negative reviews, some with pretty nasty headings? Did he not understand that this was MY opinion only? And why did my review anger him where others did not? And where is his review? Just questioning. I DO understand ""this kind"" of music and I do absolutely love Mannheim Steamroller, but unfortunately I do not love this album. Nor does anyone else that I have played it for. Thanks very much!"
1,Too general,"I was disappointed by this book. I just found it too overwhelming and too general to figure out what should work for me. I stopped dyeing my hair 2 years ago and was hoping for some help on what colors to choose for clothing, makeup, and hair care. But this book was too hard to figure out what I should do. There are a number of lists of hair and makeup products - but which ones do I choose? There were a few pages dedicated to good makeup color palettes according to eye color and skin tone - but mine wasn't represented! (Brown eyes; pale rosy skin tone). I actually ended up feeling more confused after reading this book."
1,Not a good gift,"I gave this to my 81 year old father. He is about 6 foot and 220 lbs. He could not use it in his Chevy SUV because it was too tall and didn't rotate well. He said it was uncomfortable. So now it gathers dust. He did say that is was ""thoughtful"". Nice!"
1,Extremely one-sided,This book is written by someone that obviously is on the side of Darlie Routier. I wouldn't doubt if he was paid by the family for his works. The book reads more like an commercial than a work of truth. He only presented the side that points to doubt (he left out much of the evidence that clearly points to her quilt). It is my opinion to not waste your money on this work of fiction on a sad true crime.
1,don't buy Bratz,"Buy a Bratz ONLY if you want to spend half of the day attempting to get it OUT of the packaging!!!! I bought a Bratz doll and a Brabie Fairytopia for my daughter. Within five minutes, I had the Barbie opened and she was playing with it very happily. Forty-five minutes later, I was still working on getting the Bratz out of the box. I finally gave up!! It is actually glued in the center in the box!!! What idiots would glue a doll into a box???? I called the company and the representative hung up on me! The next person I talked to gave me a fake email address! Buy Barbie instead!"
1,lagging at it's best,"if you already have your ps2 wired online.....and think going wireless would be cool....don't do it. i thought the very same thing and bought the linksys ""b"" game adapter. it connects online right out of the box....even with enrcyption on. i mostly play socom 2 online....i was voted off for extreme lag. i don't know if there are anyother wireless game adapters but going wireless with this product isn't what the company advertizes it to be. the company says lag free gaming experience...no....it's lag all the way experience...i haven't tried the ""g"" adapter but don't think i will do so anytime soon.....i'm staying wired."
1,Not Compatable with my Computer,I had to return this product as it wasn't compatable with my video card. I think it would be good if I were able to use. It has a lot of updates from Roxio 6 which I had been using.
1,"It works, but it is not stereo.",This unit looks good and sounds okay but I was not impressed with the amount of power for the wattage rating that it gives. I do not know why it says stereo. There is not any pan controls even though it is listed as a feature. The only stereo input is the Aux RCA input and it combines it into mono however the EQ does effect the channels separately. The digital effect is a one decent preset of echo with reverb. This unit died after 3 outings powering 4 ohm loads. There are no internal fuses that I can find. I will find out how good NADY warranties are next.
1,MISLEADING TITLE,Having read the synopsis and previous reviews I had expected to open up a book on controlling tactics used by law enforcement professionals based on aikido techniques. How wrong can you be.The first 67 pages are what you expect in a general book on the subject of aikido. The 21 Tactics shown left me stunned.No17 sums it up. You cannot use this defence where an attacker bearhugs from behind around your elbows.We teach self defence and practice these types of attacks on both males & females. The suggested raising of the arms to break the grip as you step back is a joke. The attacker is usually right agianst your body and you cannot step back or raise your arms.There are numerous successful ways of defending agianst this type of attack but this is not one to be recommended.Overall I was disappointed with the content and feel I waisted my money.
1,Hardly worth 1 star,The quality of this DVD collection is extremely poor. Films are missing segments. The sound is very poor and occasionally out of synchronization with the video. VHS of individual films is by far a better choice.
1,Dangerous,"I was putting my trampoline away when it snapped closed and hit me in the face. The strength of the springs that make the trampoline fold in half caused it close with such force that it split my lip open and nearly knocked my front tooth out. After a trip to the emergency room to have 7 stitches in my lip on the outside and inside and being monitored by the dentist to make sure my tooth doesn't turn black and fall out....I highly recommend staying away from this product. I can only imagine what would happen if a child or young adult was hit with this dangerous piece of equipment! This product doesn't even deserve one star, however, the computer will not permit me to leave the rating blank:("
1,Living In Fantasy Land,"This book has been around a long time (1983) and has gone through 3 editions. Obviously it is not without charm and appeal. One reason is because the author stresses the more fantasy oriented role of the creative thinker. By using exercises that are ambiguous and metaphors to make his point such as comparing the more creative, diffused, playful `soft' thinker to the `hard' more logical, rational, reality thinker, people get lost in this book the same way they do in an Alice and Wonderland tale. Creative, Heinrich Kley inspired illustrations by George Willett add to the magical setting. However, the author does not offer any concrete plan to increase creativity, as is done in 'The Creativity Formula' (www.creativityformula.com), and one comes away from this book with the same euphoric feeling one might get after watching a Peter Pan movie. ""Oh, if only I could fly.""Gerard Bianco author of the mystery novel, Dying For Deception (www.dyingfordeception.com)"
1,what the heck!,What has come of this world are we all 2 years old! This movie was a joke what a stupid movie i feel dirty just by watching this crap!
1,Replacement Product,I bought this pan to replace one I accidentally burned. It had pits in the inside bottom. The seller was very generous when I told him of the problem. I would recommend making purchases from their store.
1,"Not ""tuff"" at all",Sadly these balls are not tough at all. I had them only a week before they were shredded. My dog only played with the balls at the beach. We would play fetch but he was not allowed to play with them unattended. I bought them because they were made in the USA and they were non toxic. I wish they would have lasted longer. I will not purchase them again.
1,"Afghan food, minus spices.","Why on earth would you write an Afghan cookbook and leave out the spices? I love Afghan food and this book was a huge disappointment. I find it hard to believe that well-made aushak has no flavoring other than salt and mint. Worse than worthless, because it could have been so much better."
1,Dollar store cheap,"As other reviews said, the magnet on this thing is small (and weak), and barely glued on. Magnet came unglued within 30 seconds of opening product. Not worth the money if your paying more then a dollar.I had to return mine because my ""stainless steel"" dishwasher is actually aluminium, my fault for not realizing. Problem is there is no iron for magnets to stick to, and it's not smooth enough surface for suction cups to stay on either so i'm back to the drawing board. Save yourself a little time and toss a refrigerator magnet on yours to make sure."
1,Don't buy,Did you know that you are not buying from Amazon.com and they don't care if you get your order or not.
1,"Picture Deceiving, not Apple Product","The cable they sent is a cheap generic cable that doesn't work properly. The image I looked at had the Apple logo on it, but he cable is not. This product page is utterly misleading and should be modified to correctly describe the product this company is selling (i.e. a non-Apple, third party cable)"
1,worse than bad,"promising at the beginning, but then it disintegrated into stilted acting, a cheesy plot.......overall ""worse than bad"""
1,DONT BUY THIS OVER PRICED JUNK,DONT BUY THIS ITEM! IT DOESNT EVEN DESERVE THAT ONE STAR! LITSEN THE IPOD IS EXTREMELY OVER PRICED YOU CAN GET A Creative Labs Zen Xtra 60 GB MP3 Jukebox FOR $350 RITE NOW AND 40 GB FOR $300 DONT THROW AWAY YOUR MONEY FOR THE SAME THING. IPODS MAX GB IS 40 AND ZEN IS 60 SO YOU GET 20 GB MORE FOR OVER $100 LESS. I REPEAT DONT BUY THIS ITEM IT IS OVER PRICED AND NOT WORTH IT. GET THE Creative Labs Zen Xtra 60 GB MP3 Jukebox.
1,Kind of funny but outdated,I did a bunch of the stuff in here when I was in jr high. A lot of it involves tricks that can't be done due to today's technology.
1,No stars!,This is nothing but christian preaching! I highly resent that the description of these books does not indicate that. Total waste of money!
1,Thirteen Days,When I bought this movie I did not know it was for a different region. It WILL NOT PLAY ON ANY OF MY DVD PLAYERS! I am very upset by this!
1,What a disappointing movie,"My sweetie and I settled down on the couch for a good, romantic movie. This wasn't it. I found parts of it annoying, like how they didn't have the house ready for the hurricane before it hit. The scene of throwing the cans in the garbage was just stupid. And the ending was terrible.I would not recommend this movie to anyone.Such a shame, since I like both Richard Gere and Diane Lane."
1,The movie that makes godzilla look good,"This so called shark thriller lacks three things plot, dialogue, and complexity. The people of Jaws should have ended this series 2 movies ago. I do not recomend this movie to anyone."
1,Works but limited,"The product worked but only about 500 yards. This may be due to trees, etc. I suppose in an open foield you might achieve long range conversation."
1,Great book until someone tells you it is fake,"It is a very well writing, inspiring book. Unfortunately most of it probably didn't happen, which I found out halfway through the book and is why I stopped reading it."
1,Didn't Work,"This cable never worked. I tested it on my tv and my projector, used different laptops and even another cable a friend had, everything worked except any configuration with this cable. Save your money."
1,poor quality,I installed it in my hunting area... but it would not spread the deer corn but about 5 feet...the little motor doesnot have enough power to throw the corn as it should...
1,"Don't Waste Your Time Reading ""The Tenth Circle""","I am actually embarrassed that I stuck it out and finished reading this book. As mentioned by others, I too hoped something positive would come out of this rambling pile only to be disappointed. This author has written some good books, but this is NOT one of them."
1,are they still selling this POS?,"I've have had all I can take! I am pitching this coffee maker because it's impossable to pour a cup of coffee w/o dribbling hot coffee all over the counter or sink or floor. Bought it for our RV and put up with it.Sold the RV and built a cabin and still put up with it ! Until today! Yes, it's too hot,it's hard to fill, it shuts off too soon but I could deal with these flaws if I could pour a cup of coffee into a cup! Shame on you Crusinart, still selling this POS 5 years later."
1,Waste of Money,I bought this radio as a birthday present for my boyfriend. He was unable to get a clear reception anywhere outside in downtown Boston. It was a complete waste of money. Buyer Beware!!!
1,Lame,"First off, I intentionally ordered the blue one. They sent me a red one anyway. Second, the thing stinks. It's pretty stiff, so it's not very comfortable in my pocket. Third, it doesn't snap closed. I tend to play with my keys in my pocket and this thing kept opening up so I'd have loose keys in my pocket. If you leave it alone, it'll work fine, but it wasn't working for me."
1,Methods discribed does not work!,"The method Discribe in this book is ghosting. Contuining where some one else has left off. One, it is very hard to find the information of a suitable canadite, and two if you could, it is not possible to obtain their birth certificate without their ID or the ID of either parent. This is the starting point and all the following steps are not possible without this one."
1,Vickilew.....Terrible!,"This is a terrible product. I was so surprised-because I thought the package looked to cute. I never heard of the company---Vickilew--but I thought I would take a chance, since we have been potty training for a little while-with little success. My son wanted nothing to do with this DVD...and we thought it was aweful. The ""Once Upon a Potty"" book ended up doing the trick--thank goodness. I would suggest that instead. This company does not make quality products from what I've seen. The tape is the same thing over and over again--and not appropriate for the suggested ages."
1,Not to scale,"Although I haven't actually bought this, I wanted to warn buyers that these are not actually to scale as the description says. Specifically, the Earth marble is smaller than both the Venus and Mars marbles, when in reality Venus is a bit smaller than Earth, and Mars is much smaller. Anyway, if you're picky about these things like me, it's something you should know. This set (Earth, Mars, Moon To Scale Marble Box Set) with just Earth, the Moon and Mars is a bit more accurate. So there's my nitpicky review."
1,Terrible,This book has nothing to suck you in with a boring beginning. I stopped reading after a few pages. I would not buy it if it cost money. Not worth it.
1,The next book...,"For the unforgotten chapter in this book, see the reviewer from St. Paul's comments. It this a real review? The reviewer seems to have a lot more insight into the author and his psychotherapist partner than the average reader could have gained from this book. I found the book to be generally dry, and lacking a real connection with the average reader. I do not agree that this is a very insightful book as the reviewer, David, from St. Paul would like you to believe."
1,stick to the entertainment careers,"While this book was written in an entertaining...although vulgarly entertaing fashion, it wasn't about becoming ""skinny"", ie. a weight loss approach. Basically, it was about how factory farming is a bad thing. No arguments here, just not what i was committing my valuable time to reading about at the moment that i needed diet advice!It neglected to go into the underlying reasons to reject eating animal products. For instance, what if I get eggs from my own farm chickens that run free through the pasture and eat wholesome foods? Are the eggs still bad? I know lots of skinny girls that eat meat, eggs and junk food.I can see their line of logic but it's very poorly fleshed out. The guilt or disgust factor only last so long for anyone with a brain to ""think for themselves."" This book stops short of anything meaningful to take away."
1,Lemon,I loved this item while it worked and had almost a year of good tuning and dvd play but one day the tv went black of course my receipt is more than faded and magnavox was no help
1,Goodbooks does not allow returns,"In the first place, I ordered Understanding Organizations purportedly as a new book, and when it came it was used. Not a huge deal, because it had not been notated much. But it was not the Handy book I was needing, and when I tried to return it, goodbooks informed me they do not take returns. So buyer beware, unless you are absolutely sure you want the book and don't mind if it is used."
1,Wonderful concept but horrible execution,"Doing an album of first-act finales is a terrific idea, but Craig Rubano doesn't trust his material. His readings are done very arch and self-conscious. ''Anything Goes'' is performed with a Latiny flavor; part of ''The Impossible Dream'' is sung in Spanish. There are too many gimmicks. Rubano sounds like he's always ''on''; each song comes across like an ''acting exercise.'' He can't seem to sing anything simply or directly. The arrangements are too busy, and he pushes to sell a song. He blasts away the endings, especially on ''My Own Best Friend'' and ''There's Always One You Can't Forget.'' So much for any subtlety or vulnerability. Too bad. Rubano's got a nice voice (if not distinguished), but he performs as if he knows that all too well."

1,What A Bust,"After much shopping around I picked the Garmin Quest 2 for its features and price.However, what I got was a product that would not work out of the box. Yes it would turn on and off go through the set up and menu options. Have taken this unit on several trips each time with another person trying to get the unit to work with no luck. What did I find wrong!o Will not navigate and give voice instructions, will only say (satellites lost)o Will not give accurate location.o Unit is very slow.At this point I could go on and on but what would be the point, save your money and get the Zumo 550 or 660 wish I had!"
1,"A fallen star, very disappointing","I have a collection that goes back to 1965, and I have been a subscriber for some 20 years.The magazine; however, has become the province of the radical environmetalist movement. The editorial content leans heavily toward the left, and the choice and variety of articles has degenerated over the years. Even the quality of the writing has been eroded as the magazine tries to reach a wider audience with its leftist environmental propaganda.In sum, a great publication has been hijacked by a group of irrational environmentalists who have little interest in any subject other than trees and the occasional politically correct topic."
1,Very Out Of Date,"Some of the components that are required for the projects are not easy to find. Also, the book is not very well organized. Im sorry I purchased this book."
1,Motorola Bluetooth H3,"Fair headset. Size, weight, comfort and battery life is good.The incomming sound quality is very good, problems start with outgoing sound. People tell me I sound like I'm in a tube with echos. Volumn control hard to adjust, talking outside can at times be only fair and the directions with the units beeping is not easy to remember."
1,This is NOT a compilation.,"Be warned that this is not a compilation album. None of the songs are performed by the original artists.In fact, the renditions of You & Me & the Bottle Makes 3, Zoot Suit Riot, and Barflies at the Beach are very poorly done. They are by some studio band that is not even named on the cd.The renditions of the swing standards (Minnie the Moocher, In the Mood, Sing Sing Sing, etc.) are medocre at best."
1,No- it's not okay,I never write reviews because being an avid reader-I would rather read -but this book is-was-will be a disappointment. Glad I purchased it on a daily deal or my disappointment would be greater. After reading the reviews & the credentials of the author I had high hope s for the book. The best review I read was by N . Andreassen And he only touched on the glaring problems of the book.
1,Absolutely Pets Rip Off,Purchased over a month ago. Never arrived. Do not purchase from Absolutely pets. I ended up going to PetCo and found what I needed. took my money never received products.
1,Prepare for severe speed reduction and constant problems,"Microsoft continues their legacy of software that doesn't work. I've been using Windows since the very beginning and 2000 professional and windows xp was about the only solid operating systems Microsoft has released. You would expect this so called upgrade to further improve upon this, instead it is many steps backwards. BTW, I have a 4400 AMD, 3 gigs of ram, and can say that Vista is SLOW SLOW SLOW. Be prepared for everything to run slower than it did on XP. Cool interface, about the only positive thing about Vista I have found so far. Searches are also much faster, but hardly a reason to upgrade. Be prepared for Windows Updates after installing Vista that actually cause once working drivers to stop working. I'm tempted to go back to XP, so needless to say a big waste of time and effort."
1,Smell is Sickening - Threw Away After Using Once,"I picked these up at my local heath food store, thinking that if they sold them at the health food store they must be good. However, they had an overpowering flowery smell that made me downright sick. The smell was so bad and so powerful that I had to immediately go over the surface I had cleaned with another cleaning product to get rid of the smell of these wipes. The only people who I could imagine liking these are those who like really heavy, flowery perfumes. Not me. After using just two wipes, I threw away the whole package. Getting my money's worth from the package was not worth the headache they gave me."
1,"ok product, SHI TTY company","The wires work as they should for all PS console platforms PS0Ne, PS2, PS3 but the company sucks. Take Your money elsewere, its not worth the headache. These idiots know nothing of customer service, but to someones credit, amazon did refund Me My money, but thats hardly the point, esp. since it was such a cheap buy; I want to be treated w/ dignity when I buy something. The ""You get What You pay for"" credo isn't good enough for Me, whether I purchase a 0ne cent Item or Five hundered-thousand dollar item I demand respect. I & every other consumer out there deserves much more then being treated like a dollar bill with fingertips, with which to place an order.The consumer industry are many but together We consumers are greater. Beware the wrath of the consumer!"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS COFFEE MAKER!,"I have had my 12 cup Brewstation for a little over a year. I bought it for the express purpose of getting rid of the glass carafe concept which eventually breaks and requires expensive replacement. Just today the plastic ""bucket"" that receives the brewed coffee began a steady stream of a leak from the coffee bucket valve which resulted in coffee all over the counter! I transferred the coffee to another carafe and tried putting some water into the bucket. Again, a steady stream. This product is a good concept but has NOT been designed for long term durability. There are cheap plastic parts on the release valve of the bucket that cannot be replaced...and I'm not ABOUT to buy a new bucket. Pass up this model, folks, it's a great disappointment in the end."
1,"I love the Flash, but this DVD set STINKS","NO special features, NO clean up of the Picture, NO clean up of the sound, NOTHING. This DVD is 1 step up from owning the series on VHS. Everything with this set feels like it was hated from the moment of production.What I don't understand is why it costs so much for this set. I could've done most of this DVD on my home computer and had better quality. It's REALLY sad to see that The Greastest American Hero actually looks BETTER than the Flash given that TGAH is almost a full 10 years BEHIND it.Still, if you're looking for The Flash, get it. I seriously doubt WB will reproduce it."
1,HUH???,"This book drove me and several of my friends crazy. Was Esther Pauline? Why did she cooperate at the trial? So many unanswered questions, so much left hanging. Is that necessary? Most of us just decided to just forget the whole thing and end the discussions. We simply were too confused and frustrated."
1,Movie score from... eh...,"The last 100 years must have passed Lauridsen untouched. This could have been written a century ago and wouldn't have been a scandal. Today, it sounds like the movie score from... eh... whaddayacallit...?"
1,Rediculous,"When I received this cd in the mail I was so excited to listen and hear the songs I missed hearing for the last few years since my cd was misplaced. However, this cd skipped about 10 times throughout the lenght. I mean skipping beyond being able to listen to the actual song. I was completely scammed by the seller and cannot listen to the cd at all!"
1,Battery does not last,"After charging the battery over 18hrs, it lasted less than a day with minimal usage."
1,Smokehouse Chicken Chips dog treat,"Nov 2011. I previously gave a 5 star rating for this product. I have ordered this product every month for several months including the Jerky product. BUT, one of my poodles has become ill. These products are made in CHINA.Yes, my poodles love this product. We will no longer order this product. I pray Amazon will take this product off their market.Chicken Skewers Dog Treats, 4oz"
1,"Great idea, poor writing, bad editing","It's always sad to see a good idea trashed by bad editing. Walt Becker is a fine storyteller, but a mediocre writer; the niceties of grammar and language are beyond him. A decent editor could have saved this book; someone with a knowledge of verb tenses, someone who knew the difference between 'bellow' and 'billow'. As a professional proofreader and copyeditor of Science Fiction, it always annoys me to see a good tale go to waste. It's unfortunate that no-one took the time with this one."
1,Miserable Product,"Used this trimmer for about 8 months before finally busting it open on my driveway in a fit of rage after it tore into my shins one too many times. I swear I spent more time applying band aids (yeah I know, long pants...) and trying to get the line to feed properly than I did weed eating.Not only is it poorly designed from a shin saving standpoint but even when it feeds line properly (infrequent) it uses the .80 line like crazy. Sure, it has plenty of power and can cut through nearly anything, but the strong motor doesn't make up for the poor design and safety deficiencies. The best thing I can say about the ""grass hog"" is that as a string trimmer it's decent but extremely hard to control- it kept digging in and wanting to cut way more than I needed. As an edger it's flat out terrible and leaves pieces of line all over my yard and street.A real piece of garbage (literally). I destroyed it rather than sell it on Craigs to some unsuspecting guy with weak shins. AVOID THIS PRODUCT."
1,Horrible product,"Okay, I read the good and the couple bad reviews and thought I'd give them a go... Wish I hadn't! These fastwipes should be called slow non-performing wipes cause that is exactly what they do! & Yes, I read the directions. Someone said it's like a paper towel and that is pretty much true. Might as well save yourself 5 bucks and use your kitchen paper towels. These wipes didn't even get off fingerprints. Totally useless and time consuming garbage."
1,A TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENT,"I waited for this book to come out all spring. Being a Cornwell fan I ASSUMED she would deliver the same spell binding ""can't put it down"" effect she always does. Not so! This book was a total disappointment. If this were the first PC book I had ever read, I'd never pick another one up. PC: If you are reading these reviews.. let us know what happened? Pull it back together and give us what we expect! When the writing is GOOD, we will have no problem letting you know!Disappointed in Indiana"
1,Dull....,"Sorry,but no tear for Armageddon.It's so dull and boring.I wasted money(thank god,it's only $3 for renting not $7 in cinema nor $16 for vdo) and I mean WASTE."
1,The Worst DVD Transfer Job Imaginable,"A fabulous movie, but totally wasted on DVD. Paramount is only going for a money grab on this one. No features, shoddy sound quality. One measley trailer. All of this for a kings ransom in price. This DVD is simply not worth purchasing...Garbage!Shame on Paramount for this obvious money grab. Next time spend more than 10 minutes on moving a masterpiece onto a terrific forum. You have done the movie no justice."
1,One of the worst books I have ever read,"Like so many others, I was very disappointed in this book. I volunteered to review the book for my book discussion group, knowing it was a best-seller. It is the first time in my memory that everyone in the group disliked a book chosen for review. Although I do not claim any talent of my own for writing, I do recognize such a talent when it exists. Alas, none is exhibited in Horse Whisperer... Instead of looking at what is on the NY Times Best Seller list, I recommend that fellow readers follow Oprah's suggestions."
1,what a waste of money!!!!!!!!,"I am surprised Amazon even allows this product to be sold. It is the worst designed gas container!!!!!! The one thing they don't mention, is that you have to squeeze the handle and pump to get the gas out. This can get very tiring after 2 gallons. The handle leaks, when you rest it as the picture shows. I just threw $100.00 away, don't make the same mistake. spend a few more dollars and get a gravity fed. or one that has a hand crank"
1,If Floyd knew this was going to happen...,"HOLY S**IT!!! Are you serious? I am an absolute fan of Floyd and Electronic/Techno music(how that happens, I don't know) but this is a tragic mistake that know realignment of the stars could ever correct. I am in no way taking from each of these contributers ""talent"", but come on! DID YOU EVER LISTEN TO THE ORIGINALS! I'll give credit to Hande Frei and Learning to Fly. It's different enough to be considered original for a tribute, but the others are absolute poop(keeping to the review guidlines...) Can you wash your eyers to get that sound out somehow? eechh..."
1,Terrible!!!!!,"Terrible! Since my bf and i are expecting our first, i bought this book for him based on other customer reviews. I thought that it would be a good resource for him since it offered comic relief while providing important information. Unfortunately, that was NOT the case. My bf gave it a chance but could not get through the first 2 chapters. He found it very offensive and degrading. According to him it makes it seem as though men are complete idiots and insensitive bafoons. He found it extremely distateful."
1,Good starter map,"I bought this map on Amazon and it was a good basic starter map for our 10 day trip to Kauai. Ironically, it was the only map we saw available when we first arrived and in many cases what I paid on Amazon was much cheaper then the price for the same thing on Kauai itself! However, if you really want to travel around Kauai and are going to be looking for specific streets, you need something much more detailed then this map has to offer."
1,movie is supposed to scare and fry your nerves but its only annoying and pretty sad,"The movie is about an ordinary family consisting of a Mother, Father, Son, a Young Daughter and an Older Daughter whose worlds turn upside down as 3 dangerous men led by Muse Watson (I Know and Still Know What You Did Last Summer), who break into their house and terrorize them all. The Oldest Daughter and Young Daughter hide in the house away from the men who are beating and torturing the other family members. The Oldest takes matters into her own hands when the Younger Daughter gets kidnapped and she stands up for herself against the evil men. Sometimes almost effective but doenst add up to nothing but sillyness and badly staged situations and acting. This ""Horror"" movie doesnt scare nor fry your nerves, it just gets annoying after awhile when you watch it. Pretty sad if you ask me. Watson is unbelievably corny as the led thug."
1,"Not that good. Go with FatMat brand, it is way better and less expensive","This brand is very expensive and it really does not perform as it's much less expensive and better quality competitor, FatMat. The adhesive was not even really sticky and the vibration damping was any good either. Thank God I got this small bad small taste of this Dynamant Extreme, because is not good at all and it's the most expensive of all the sound deadning brands. Go with FatMat, it's much better and less expensive"
1,Shows how pathetically manipulative adolescents can be,"This book is really not for mature adults. It tries to show how to manipulate a man into feeling differently about a woman. Basically, it is a substitute for real intimacy and developing authentic relationships. I recommend guys to read this, just so they can tell when they are being manipulated. But this really is for giggly girls."
1,Too quiet,"This was way too quiet, even on it's loudest setting. My infant didn't benefit from it at all. The sounds are fine, and not too repetative as with some machines, but even in a small room (really small) I found it too quiet to be effective."
1,Please listen to it before you buy it!,"Please listen to it before you buy it! and then you wont buy it!Can she sing yes, but nothing else to say positive!The songs have no hook and sound very similar."
1,HATE HATE HATE,"My husband has had to use every ounce of self restraint not to throw this thing against the wall. He brings our son to work and as many water combinations as he has tried, it always heats the water to boiling. It takes long enough to do that and then you get stuck waiting for it to cool down."
1,Not worth it!!!,"My daughter didn't even get to use it. It actually is really small. And my daughter is tiny all ready and very thin. So you would think she can fit, but actually the toilet itself was too small. Not worth anything. Worst product."
1,not a good vacuum,"I bought this vacuum in July, 2008. I wanted something light weight, bagless and works on both hardwood floor and carpet. I have hardwood floor for the whole house with area rugs in every room. I noticed the vacuum would be overheat and stopped working after 10 minutes of carpet vacuuming. It lasted longer with hardwood floor. I think it's the power nozzle for carpet cleaning that is easily over heated. I don't mind the engine shuts off by itself because I don't want the vacuum burned. Anyway, it's broken couple days ago by the neck between the suction head and the dust container. I am very disappointed and will not recommend it to anyone. I am buying a Bissell 82H1 which cost a bit more. I hope it will last longer."
1,Four Feathers Fails,"This version of Four Feathers can't even be compared with the original produced in 1939. The story line was harder to follow. There were too many dark scenes where nothing could be seen. Also, characters were added that were not in the original."
1,Did not work.,"Could not read numbers. Double images. Very blurry. It did count down, but hard to read even if just five inches from my eyes."
1,Not As Good As The Original,"I had high expectations for this album when it first came out. Lo and behold, about every song on here is a remix. What I really expect from a Greatest Hits album is for the hits to sound just like the original. About every other song on here ""Vogue"", ""Like A Prayer"", or ""Express Yourself"" is a remix. If you want the originals, get the originals---unless you want a change of pace."
1,Blue eyes look grey.,"The printer works fine. But the color isn't right. When I print pictures of people with blue eyes, the blue is a muddy grey color. I am disappointed since the whole point of the printer is to print photos.Update: 10/25/2010 - I'm still using this printer and it still works. I gave up on using it to print photos because of the color problem, but it works well as a normal printer and copier."
1,cheap lids and handles,"Cheap, cheap, cheap constructions of the handles. I bought two of these, one for me and one for my Mother. I envisioned cooking up a meal in mine and swapping it out for my Mother's when I went to visit. When I opened the box one lid was loose. I tightened it with a Phillips screwdriver, and washed both pots and lids, as instructed. Now both the handles are loose, dishwater collects underneath them, and my Mother can't be bothered to pull out a Phillips screwdriver every time she washes the pot and lid. Wish I had never bought them."
1,Nonsense,"I know my history and this book is pure nonsense,fabrication and a revision of history to support ahidden agenda. Ukrainians also were in large numbers, inhabitants of the very same concentration camps as others. Put simply this book is pure racist and not worth the paper it is written on."
1,Didn't Work,"Though it smells nice and now takes up space on my counter, it didn't work for me as a yeast infection cure."
1,This item randomly showed up at my house!,"I checked my order history thinking it may have been an accident, but it is not on there. Also, I am not able to verify my purchase so amazon also has no record of it. It came under my name from amazon with the same tracking number as another package. HOW DID THIS HAPPEN? I DO NOT WANT THIS ITEM IN MY HOUSE! I will post a picture if you don't believe me."
1,CAVEAT EMPTOR!! THIS IS NOT THE COLPIX ALBUM!,"CAVEAT EMPTOR! BUYER BEWARE! THIS IS NOT THE COLPIX ALBUM CP 407, even though it cunningly USES the cover art from the original album, it does NOT contain the tracks of that LP! BEWARE!!!!"
1,What a posers,"What a sh%t music this is! All theri works and they aint no grunge. They are bunch of ""trying to be's"" and their music is a total beep pop delux, or I should not write delux!"
1,vit D,The description of this product nor the picture of the bottle does not say it contains 2000 iu of vitamin D. I bought this and i am unable to use it because of the vitamine D. I am rating it low because of this. Otherwise it is a good product. I have used it without the vit D and I was very satisfied.
1,question,i am looking for a warmer that will warm frozen breastmilk. Will this model do that? I have previously purchaesd the night and day warmer and i am taking it back cause you can not heat plastic liners. So does this one heat frozen breastmilk?
1,Poor Reprint of a Great Book,"Beginning in 1901, when the telephoto lens was 10 years old, the Marriages began systemmatic shooting of the sculpture of one of the most outstanding Gothic cathedrals in France or elsewhere. The original 1909 classic is still available for $50 to $100 on many of the internet used and rare book dealers (my copy was $47), and those interested in this suject are urged to seek it out. The edition offered here - a copy of which I sent back - is a poor reprint. There are two features that recommend the original work: an excellent descriptive text in both English and French, and the stunning photography. This oversize reprint reproduces the text clearly, but the photographs (every other page) look like they were run on a dying Xerox, and are functionly useless, especially for the close study they were designed for. Find a good original and avoid this reprint."
1,Never got the product,"My order was canceled with no explanation! Guess I won't get to find out if this product was any good or not. The company ""ANTonline"" didn't come through for me."
1,"Bad Cop, Bad Cop","Tami Hoag's characters have a fondness for profanity. So, if you have a problem with text laced with tough street talk best set this one aside. I'm not a prude but I found the salty language a little over-seasoned for my taste.Ms. Hoag's tough homicide detective, Kovac and his foul-mouthed sidekick, Tinks, are on the trail of a sexual sadist. Kovac knows who did the awful deed right from the start, giving us an insight into the tunnel vision that often seems to affect non-fictional cops. Go after the suspect with everything you've got - due process is for wimpy liberals.Plot was a bit telegraphed."
1,Complete disappointment,"If you are a 14 year old raver this cd is great and I highly recommend it.If not, dont waste your money, or time looking for that ""one good track"", because its not there."
1,most disappointing pixar movie,"this movie seemed more like a disney movie than what i expect from a pixar movie. even by disney movie standards, it was poor. the story was very weak. I kept waiting for the movie to get to some sort of adventure or point and by then it was already over."
1,2000+ can not be wrong,"Spore is a could have been great game.Sometimes a production team is having so much fun with designing a product that they forget to make the product. Then production reminds them that they have to ship something. So the team ships something. Spore seems be one of those products. Spore is 5 games in one. The first 3 are short pre-school games. The 4th game is a simple and short world conquest game. The 5th game is a galactic lackey game. This is the big game and all you really get from the first 4 games are icons for the 5th game. You are the pilot of a space ship and you fly around doing all the work and earning all the money so the home world can have a empire. To make it even less fun, the more you grow your empire, the more the game nags you with BS.Better games are out there."
1,Did I Miss Something?,"Golly! I didn't find out until the other day that BSB came out with a new CD last summer. It's called ""Never Gone"" and I didn't even know BSB was trying to make a comeback! No one tells me anything! Anyway, I listened to at least 2 songs on the CD and then I couldn't take it anymore. BSB will only be known as one of the many corny, untalented boy groups in American music history. Believe that!"
1,Epson common problem,"As I been used Epson printers for years and recognized that the printer head will start to dry out if it has not been use in more than 2 weeks after 6 months of usage. I would recommend myself as to all Epson fans should print at least once per week to keep the ink in the printer head flows. If your printer have problem starts to print with cut out lines, just remove the print head and deep into hot water for about an hour. You will have much more chance to get the print head clean than to give it up. That's what I normally do, and it works. You also can use cleaning alcohol instead of hot water !!!!"
1,Highly disappointing,"Although the author has the requisite academic credentials, she is tone-deaf where Buddhism is concerned. This book reads like something written in the early 20th century, when studies of Buddhism were entirely overlayed with Western philosophical preconceptions. A much better life of the Buddha is Sherab Chodzin Kohn's ""The Awakened One: A Life of the Buddha.""Armstrong's main contribution is to situate Buddhism in the context of the yoga movement that was in full swing when the Buddha lived. But she is so unreliable in discussing the essentials of both Buddhism and yoga that only serious practitioners will be able to see through her Western academic filter.The biggest annoyance of this book is the author's insistence on using Pali spellings of Buddhist terms that are generally known in Sanskrit. This just makes the book harder to read. Unfortunate."
1,a Big let down!,I have been a Dragonlance fan for a very long time (roughly 10 years)I have waited a long time for this book.I felt that it just did not deliver.Weis and Hickman are too busy trying to undo what every other author has written about the Dragonlance world to write a decent story.There writing has changed greatly since there Chronicles and Legends trilogys and not for the better.If you are a fan of Dragonlance this book is worth a glance just dont expect anything special.
1,The 2nd worst horror movie I've seen.,"The movie ""Leeches"" is probably always going to be the most horrible movie I've seen, but this film is probably the 2nd worst. It starts off really boring, and got me thinking ""I'm glad this was only straight-to-DVD"". The whole film is really weird. The scary scenes aren't even scary, either. There's really nothing that's special about this film. Another thing that was really horrible was those creatures. They were so fake and dumb looking. The ending sucked also. Altogether, this film was a HUGE dissapointment, especially when it came from the creators of [REC] and Quarantine."
1,THE WORST!,"This book was the worst! I have been trying to read it for almost two months now. I've read several books in the meantime and I only plan to continue reading ""For The Love of Money"" because I started it. Omar Tyree has left a bitter taste on me when it comes to his books now. I have read Flyy Girl in a matter of no time and I wish he would have just left well enough alone. I am very dissapointed with this book, and what is up with the sorry poetry that Tracy was trying to write. I was just not feeling anything about it and I am sorry I brought it. Sorry Omar, but you've bombed this time."
1,>_<,The thing broke in a day. The gift box it came in had stains and smelled inside. Threw the box away in hurry. Maybe not the seller's fault (except for the box) but I would not buy similar product ever again.
1,Shallow and overly pleased with itself,The main character was the least interesting one I'd ever encountered; no original thoughts and no personality. There's no incentive to keep reading when I simply don't care what happens to her! This realization made the author's note even more jarring; his inflated sense of her seems just to reflect his misrepresentation of himself and his abilities.
1,"Maybe a rent, never a buy!!!!!!!!","What are all the people giving this game good reviews for? This game is incredibly BORING!!!! It gets so old after awhile that i could only play a few levels and i just had to turn it off in disgust. I wasted my money on it, BIG MISTAKE! If you really want to see for yourselves, rent it, DO NOT BUY IT!!!!"
1,this car ...,This car can .... We had it out for less than 5 minutes before it crashed and the steering broke. I think you could definetly get a better car at a local hobby shop for about the same price. This car is definetly not worth the ... i paid for it. It lasted about 5 minutes while i was playing with it so it isnt very durable and turns to sharp causing it to lose control and crash (like what happened to me) Over all this car ... it isn't worth a penny
1,Wrong item sent,"For some reason there is a divided bowl and spoon pictured, and that what I thought I was ordering. Instead I got some huge spoons that I had no interest in"
1,"Whatever You Do, Avoid This Steaming Pile Of Poo","I just recieved this camera less than 24 hours ago and it has already bit the dust. After the batteries slowly died this morning, I replaced them and took a picture. About 5 seconds later the LCD display went black and the camera turned off. After several attempts at reviving it, I pronounced it dead and was looking forward to returning it for a better quality camera. I am hoping to get my money back and buy a Panasonic Lumix Digital Camera since it seems to take great pictures and was given great reviews. As soon as the Minolta camera died I came to Amazon.com to look up reviews and I laughed as I saw the 1 star ratings and horror stories of other customers. At least im not alone. Whatever you do, do not buy this digital camera."
1,Don't bother,"I had high hopes when starting this book. The reviews were so favorable. I received this and ""Serpentine"" as gifts. I gave up after about 200 pages. It was bogged down by an extended history of the victims family for 3 or 4 generations, and it was slow moving. If you value your time, read something else."
1,No Need To Reel This One In,Where's the beef? That is the question I asked myself when I was reading this book. 129 pages and the last few are set in a question and answer mode. Give me a break!!! I wanted a book--not some pieced together mush. I am throwing this one back.
1,Does not work for 7290,"I purchased this to replace a lost holster. The first time I tried to place the 7290 in the case, it split at the seams."
1,Could have been so much better...,"I was expecting more from this story, instead you get a lecture about crystal meth, alleged conversations and thoughts. No real details, long explanations of scenery & drug use. I felt like it was rushed and not investigated enough. I am a True Crime fan and read 2-3 books a month, and this was one of the worst."
1,Too Much Seat,"I recenetly tried out this tubside bath seat, and will be returning it later today! There is so much seat that I was not able to get to my baby to wash her. The seat sits so high from all the plastic that I had to fill by tub 1/2 way full with water, which is too much water in my opinion for a baby. The seat is so bulky that my baby was not able to splash around or kick and it was difficult to get her out of the seat. The swivel feature was not easy to use during the bath either."
1,Did not watch,"When ordering, I did now know about the specific areas assigned the DVD. I was not in the correct area for viewing. I'm sure I will return it soon."
1,se non ci fosse Ledger....,"posso dire la mia senza rischiare di essere fucilata? premetto, io non ho amato Ledger (come attore) ma qui devo ammetterlo: Ã¨ il suo film! senza la sua interpretazione non avrebbe avuto tutto il successo avuto. parlando di Bale, dai ragazzi ok Ã¨ un bel ragazzo ma il suo repertorio si ferma a due massimo tre espressioni che sfodere in tutti i suoi film..........per il resto Ã¨ un comic movie niente piÃ¹!"
1,I cut my finger on a sharp metal fastener while installing,"I immediately took it back. It seemed that only one of the metal fasteners was bad, but this was enough for me to not want this brand again. Maybe I just got a bad one, but I would thoroughly inspect this item while you installing."
1,Shameless Double Dipping,"It wouldn't cost them anything extra to release the Extended Edition instead of this, but they know that people want the Extended Edition more, so they're trying to see how many of these they can sell first before they make the poor suckers buy the next Blu-Ray package. While you can't blame a company for trying to milk it's customers, you can't blame the customers for getting upset when it's this transparent. One-Star rating because this is a gimped product designed solely to trick people into buying the Blu-Ray twice (after they already pulled the same nonsense with the DVD)."
1,Calorie counter is inaccurate,"I purchased this product around four weeks ago. The instructions on its use were a little convoluted but I managed to figure them out. The heart rate monitor and alarms work fine, but the calorie counter is miscalibrated. I noticed this when I tracked average calorie count for activities at my weight vs that reported on the watch. I then compared the monitor watch with a monitor on my treadmill. Rate and time were spot on, calorie count was far too high. I called Timex and they were very nice and promply sent me an exchange watch which they said that they had tested...it did the same thing.I lost faith in trying for another return and recalibrated the watch myself by inputing my weight minus 60 lbs. I came up with that approximation by trial and error. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this product.Signed,Nolan Jones"
1,Didn't last long.,"We've only had this tie for a couple of months and it's already broke. We used it with an arial line for my German Shephard. After about a month it starting curling and would wrap around my poor shephard's legs. I was constantly untangling her. She got used to hopping around the yard with her legs all tied together. Finally it wore thin in one spot and she broke it. She doesn't chew it so I'm not sure how it wore out so quick. I got a thicker cable this time, maybe it won't twist up so much."
1,If not for the money shot!,"First of all this movie is about revenge and hate. What would compel a person to go to extreme measures just to exact revenge (for me it's unjustified). The extreme measures in this case involve flying to Argentina, having sex with your ex boyfriend's one-night-stand(if that!)and ruining the wedding of your ex because of HATE and because he dumped you! The author must be experiencing a lot of repressed anger(I didn't read the book). This, I find stretched the limit of believability, but one can argue that it's a movie. Having said that, the only redeeming feature of the film for me is the FULL FRONTAL nude scene of ASJ. You know what I mean! I'm not a fan but I'm willing to buy this DVD just for that! How's that for someone who didn't like the movie?"
1,very disappointed,"I had problems with my original 20gb ipod when I bought it. After a few months I realized the unit itself was defective from the factory. Apple fully replaced it and I have since deleted my previous review. This is an update. This update comes several years after this ipod died due to my own negligence (I accidentally dropped it). I loved my old 20gb ipod classic. Navigation, sound quality, user interface and features were all fantastic. I replaced it with a 5th generation/30gb ipod classic which was fantastic. That ipod is now almost 4 years old and it's getting wonky. So I just replaced it with a 6th gen/16 gb Nano.If I could change the star rating on this review I would have given it 5 stars. I've grown to be quite happy with the ipod family."
1,not up to expectations,"Scanning and printing photos is much lower quality than I expected for the price and features of the machine. Document printing is quick, however it takes 30 seconds to calibrate your first page, which knocks the 32 ppm down to 16 ppm or so."
1,Kinda small,It is def water proof but I wish it was bigger. Also I have an Equinox so the straps did not fasten onto my roof rack. Plastic straps were too small. I bought 4 bungees from Home Depot and that did the trick.
1,Not so great,"I bought this book hoping for some help with my willful toddler. It came highly recommended by a friend. I was pretty disappointed in the book, because it's so pro-attachment parenting that it makes all other parents feel guilty. I don't do some of the attachment parenting in the book for legitimate, important reasons (sleeping with my infant--not so excited about the possibility of rolling over on my baby, breastfeeding--am unable to). It was frustrating that he was so bent on this perspective that I literally could not garner anything from the book. If you are not extreme attachment parents, this book probably isn't for you. For us, it was a waste of money."
1,Not as pictured,"This kit is nothing like how it's pictured, the plastic box is smoky white and not see-through. There are only 12 compartments so a lot more is mixed together than pictured and even after a replacement by Amazon I received multiple jumpers that were damaged and no where near the 350 pieces that is described."
1,Update after 3months,"I have used this product for three months straight and the first couple of days it works, killing all of the fleas. However, after that it completely quits working. It does not continue to kill the fleas all month long as promised. A few days after the application I will begin to see fleas pop up again on my dog. I need something that kills the eggs and keeps working all month. I am going to try Frontline to see if I have better luck there."
1,Very disappointing Product,"I purchased the 7"" Initial DVD player before reading any reviews on it, now I wish I hadn't been quite so quick to buy a no-name brand. The picture quality is really excellent, but unfortunately I only got 15 second to 5 minutes of viewing in before it would freeze up. After 2 weeks of continually freezing, or refusing to load at all, it's back where I got it and I'm saving for a namebrand. Whatever causes these same problems in all these 1 star reviews is still going on, mine was fresh on the shelf when I bought it in October 2004."
1,Focussed on trivialities,"This book isn't much different in content from her TV appearances. There's alot of snark but not much substance. I have to say that anyone who rails at a sit-com because it doesn't have the stereotypes she would prefer, like clearly defined gender roles and restricted sexual expression in women, is wasting everyones time and money. Too bad there's no zero star.[...]"
1,pain of salvation sucks!!!!,this new album by pain of salaavation is the worst yet its about god whut r they trying to be christian now that is lame i can't beleieve peole call this prog daniel gidlenblow is terrible go by some symphony x instread.
1,Not much to say except... terrible!,"My title says it all. It just didn't deserve all those academy awards. When I first saw it I thought it was the best movie alive. Then I bought it when it came out, I'm so deppressed I got it."
1,Old and used it shows.,I purchased this in the belief that it would work and look as good as new. Well yes it does seem to work well. But the drawback is looks and it has tha appearance of being old and tired. I believe enough said as the company who sold it tried to get extra money for a better conditioned one.
1,crumbly and mediocre,"Like others stated, these arrived in crumbs. They also didn't seem that great in taste either. They are okay for ready made gf cookies but nothing special. We were not impressed. Wouldn't buy again."
1,The marketeer's yoga book ?,"Do not get fool by the title. There is absolutely nothing new on this book except the title which is aiming to take advantage of runners who may think this book can give us that extra edge in improving our skill.If indeed any one of our fellow runners who are interested in yoga, check out the book of ""Bikram's Beginning Yoga Class"" instead. It outlines very clear pose by pose, classroom teaching, lecture type of instruction."
1,Great while it lasted,"Little over a year after purchase, it is inoperable after two or three uses. It was very convenient and quick, but certainly not worth the money."
1,"word by word, dictionary Russian/English","This book contains a lot of mistaks; e.g. the accents lacks on all of the russian words.Secondly; page 3, word 5, cousin russian; dvoiorodnaja sestra/ bratit should has been like this; dvoiorodnaja sestra/ dvoiorodnbii brat (the maskulin ending is not there)Page four, number 1; teacher (it should also been the female ending on teacher on the russian word; o ts i t je lb n i ts a)etc.Do you have a correct volume to send me? I am working to learn russian, and this confuses me!"
1,Wrong item pictured,"I don't own a Benchmade Mini Griptillian (though I wish I did). I do however own a CRKT Pazoda. The item pictured is a Pazoda, which is a far, far cry from a Benchmade Mini Griptillian. I just thought I'd take the time to point it out."
1,it's a validating book if you're a member of the choir...,"but just a universalizing generalization about liberals to me. i tend to agree with Marx (Groucho that is) that ""i would never belong to a club that would have me as a member."" that goes for liberal or conservative, if you live by that rule."
1,Avoid it unless it is required in your class,"One of the worst textbooks that I have ever owned. Nothing is clear. Here are some examples.""If X and Y are independent and f and g are measurable functions, show that f(X) and g(Y) are independent.""Are X and Y random variables, or events? What are the domain of f and g? What measurable?""Find all the joint distributions...(so on, so on.)""Joint distribution is never defined in this book. It is not even in the index.One can most likely figure out by context, but that is not the point. It is a textbook. It must teach us something, and therefore, it has to make every single little thing as clear as it can. I would recommend you to stay away from this textbook, if you are new to the probability theory. If you are required to purchase this book, I would suggest you to have another reference. I think even some of the analysis books do the better job of explaining the probability measure than this one."
1,be careful,"the product is good, but for malaysian user should be careful and alert. The current power are not same like western neither europe. its not made for 240w. Mine was dent . I'd only use for 3 minute and the coil was split. so I cant send it for repairement"
1,Bad Advice,I am a christian woman that loves and submits to her husband. This book offers terrible advice. Please find another resource for your marriage.
1,Just a collection of forms,"Wow, I can't remember ever being so disappointed in a purchase. As a prospect research manager, I purchased this book to help in training a new research assistant. There is no information in this book on how to do prospect research; it is basically a collection of forms, plenty of which are included in Cynthia Hogan's superb book on the same subject. The above review was obviously written by the writer or publisher. Don't waste your money."
1,Awful DVD!!,"This was the worst thing by Kathy Smith I have seen!! Of course I haven't yet seen the Bellydancing one. The warm-up starts out okay. Then you get to the ""work out"". First the people are not wearing workout clothes, but it looks like their out at a club. Second, their all wearing black pants/dark shoes in a dimly lit room. I CANNOT SEE THEIR FEET! How am I supposed to learn the steps if I can't make out what they are doing with their feet?? This was one the poorest attempts at dance instruction that I have seen to date. I had a very good opinion of Kathy Smith prior to seeing this video. I am really glad I did not pay more than $5 shipped for it."
1,Nope,"Sorry, but I must echo the reviewer who states this elevates this decade in football to a place in history it just doesn't merit. The Super 70s is analogous to a skunk wearing an Armani suit: flashy but in the final analysis more hype and fiction than fact."
1,Not a helpful book for educated or advanced business people,"I bought this book along with others to aide in writing a business proposal. This book was one of the least helpful. It contained review information for basic English and grammar that I was not at all interested-in. 2/3 of the book is fluff, with little or nothing to do with ""business.&quot"
1,"Also-Problems for small dogs, especially","I am thinking of adopting ASPCA rescued small dogs. After looking at books re dogs, many are unable to eat: garlic, onion, chocolate, avocado... (See for example the ""Everything Chihuahua Book""-available as well on Amazon) Also, most dogs are not supposed to have diets high in fat or salt. According to one author, dogs can even have seizures from too much of some of these ingredients-even salt. By the way, I also know birds are allergic to some of these ingredients-as well. Apparently, smaller animals are effected the most immediately and seriously by these foods. Unfortunately, the first recipe for dogs (in the intro provided for free on Amazon) uses garlic and 1/3 cup oil. I guess I will have to improvise myself: as I have found not one brand of dog food that would be safe per the rules listed above. (If I adopt.)"
1,Save your money for something that works,"I have been using Foodsaver canisters for several years and there is one thing you can bank on - at least half of them will fail immediately and the other half will fail eventually. They crack at the bottom. Almost all of my original 20 or so canisters have been replaced at least twice by Foodsaver with no charge, but I am tired of having to go through this routine over and over again. I believe all of the small canisters have failed, maybe half of the medium sized units have failed and very few of the larger ones.Now, I use only the meduim and large units - and I expect they will eventually fail.But, it appears that Foodsaver is not too concerned with quality control since they are not correcting the problem.So...I will correct the problem - I will not buy any more of their canisters."
1,"Utter, Complete BS","well, my little sister likes rap and r+b and WHY DOES SHE HAVE TO PLAY IT? get a life, listen to real music like tool or deftones. me, im going to break my sisters stereo."
1,Disappointed,Was really hoping at the least for a visible improvement even if only I could see. Read the reviews before I purchased and it may have worked for others but for me - I've wasted my money.
1,Spray pump,"I thought it would be cool not to have to pump a sprayer. That is why I bought the two wheeled sprayer. I tried it out and found it did not work out for me. It seemed to run out of air to fast.But I tried it out and sent it back.Thank you, Eddie"
1,Escanaba in da Moonlight,"As a lifetime resident of Michigan I had high hopes for this movie. I did enjoy the first half, but then the movie got too deep into mystical imagery. The acting was good, but the story went from earthy backwoods humor to mystical fantasy toward the end."
1,Possibly The Worest NInja Movie Ever Made!,From watching the other American Ninja Movies I thought that this movie would be as good. I was shocked when I saw how terrible this movie was compared to the movies before it. This movie in no way depicts the real ninja or any other Martial arts style. The acting is Bad and the special effects are worse. The plot is totally far fetched to say the least. Please don't waste your money on this poor attempt of a movie.
1,Like they say - hissing,"Sound quality is passable for the price, but right now I can hear a loud hissing (if I get close, it sounds like it might be picking up a radio station) and the speakers aren't even turned on. They're just plugged in. This product is defective right out of the box.I won't be buying from Altec-Lansing anymore. What kind of company ships a product that is so obviously broken? Do they even care?"
1,Meh,"I have gone through 3 sets of these now.... They serve their purpose until they rip apart at the silver metal section/from the black cord section. I have taken great care of them, but eventually, they always separate. I will not be purchasing another set, and suggest you look elsewhere."
1,This stuff is garbage!!,"I just tried this beef jerky. The expiration date was 3/09, but this stuff is the worst jerky I ever tried (there was no way I could actually eat this). It was so dry that it was beyond description. The taste was very, very smokey. So smokey that it seemed that a gush of liquid smoke filled my mouth when my teeth finally started to soften this hardwned leather a little. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS. DO NOT BUY THIS!"
1,"OK, Now I've Tried It Out and I've Thrown It Out!!!",Ellipsis nipsis titsis this book is crapsis. HHD>
1,This is for kids? Subject matter inappropriate for children,"This author can certainly write - it's just a shame she wastes her talent on dreadful subject matter. When did the murder of a young girl by her mother's boyfriend become good subject matter for children? Also - this book includes hauntings, channeling, and a dream sequence that describes in detail how the young girl is strangled and thrown off a cliff. Definately not what I want in my kids' heads!"
1,"Old design, inadequate adjustment","Having bought this only two weeks ago, it's already in the trash. It was designed with older, wider monitors and CRT's in mind, not the thin LED or LCD monitors with less than 2"" thick frames. In fact, if you look closely at the picture for the product, you'll see it attached to a CRT, which is the only kind of monitor it will actually work with as designed. Anything thinner and the twin adhesive strips have nothing to which they can adhere. The design of the tilt is completely obsolete for thin monitors meaning you'll either have a completely vertical holder or you'll have to bend the support rod with a vise and visegrips."
1,I'm shocked.,Nothing new AT ALL. What a surprise because I thought Mayo Clinic would have been so innovative. I like Comfort Zone Training Feeling Younger Workout - they REALLY makes me feel better right away. I also like the Feldenkrais water exercises DVDs too.
1,"Not as advertised. ONLY 24"" LONG, and only 20 1/2"" is flat","I ordered this item specifically to be able to clean out a floor furnace. I needed a 36"" reach and it is not 36"" so if you really need a 36"" crevice tool this will not solve your problem. The round part at the top which connects to the vacuum is 3 1/2"" which leaves only 20 1/2"" of flat tool to get into tight places. I really wish people would be honest about their products. It isn't 36"" just because you wish it were. If it is a 24"" tool, then just say so, people. Somebody at Dyson did a poor job if they didn't bother to measure before sending out specs on this item. I have seen it advertised as 36"" on other sites, so I don't think it is an error on the Amazon end, but who knows. Somebody somewhere did not do his or her job."
1,Are you kidding me?,"Relax.Drift away.dream...ARE YOU KIDDING ME???!!!THIS CD sucks! Not only did it not make me relax, it made me angry because I wasted my money on this crap. It will be donated to charity."
1,DVD Review,This DVD is okay with very little instructional value. The program is done in interview form with very little teaching. A bad DVD for someone who is trying to get into jazz-funk playing but probably resourceful for those familiar with the genre.
1,"ABURRIDO, ABURRIDO , ABURRIDO....","QUE DECEPCION CUANDO COMPRE ESTE DISCO, SU PRIMER DISCO ES EXCELENTE Y COMPRE ESTE PENSANDO QUE IBA A SER INNOVADOR Y FRESCO, PERO ENCONTRE TODO LO CONTRARIO. MAS DE LO MISMO, 11 CANCIONES EXACTAMENTE IGUALES, CON BUENAS VOCES PERO MAS ABURRIDAS QUE UNA CLASE DE COSTURA. ELLOS UNA Y OTRA VEZ INSISTEN EN SU DRAMATISMO EXAGERADO DEL AMOR CON LETRAS QUE PARECEN TRAUMAS DE ADOLESCENTES MAS QUE CANCIONES ADULTAS. SI PADECES DE INSOMNIO ESTE DISCO ES PERFECTO PORQUE A LA TERCERA CANCION SENTIRAS UN GRAN ESTUPOR Y A LA QUINTA CAERAS EN COMA PERMANENTE POR VARIAS SEMANAS."
1,Do not buy this product!,"Do not buy this product. I got this product as a cheap solution to play my Ipod in my car. I didn't want to spend $50-$80 on a Fm Transmitter, so I bought this instead. Worked fine for a few weeks. Ended up completely screwing up my cassette player. It would always click and pop out. Eventually my radio started not working as a result. This thing ended up shorting out my radio and nothing is functionable. Don't get this product for a cheap solution, you are much better off getting a docking FM transmitter that plugs through the cigarette lighter and charges your Ipod. Make sure you actually spend the money on a good FM Transmitter instead of going cheap and buying one of these things."
1,dont buy,this digital photo key chain is no good will not load software on computer for windows xp no help cant not use
1,A complete waste of plastic,"This sham movie is not worth the plastic it is printed on. Stein drags out one tired fallacy after another and quote-mines actual scientists in a pitiable attempt to make creationists martyrs of the scientific process. It's ridiculous and sad that a speechwriter for Nixon and quasi-actor is trying to tell scientists how to do research. It's a sham from beginning to end, as is Stein."
1,Great at first....but then fell off,I have had this heater on the bottom of a 40 gallon breeder tank for approx. 9 months. It worked great at first. But I noticed today that the heater is coming loose and falling off the bottom of the tank. Interestingly enough the glue is still stuck to the tank. It is the heating pad that has let loose.
1,Recycled flavor.,"The ridiculous name-dropping and mimicry of this novella drew my ire on every page. Leave out the dozens of floundering allusions (literary, cinematic, and musical) and there is practically nothing approaching original, unless you consider the story itself -- a blatantly Burroughs-esque nightmare of barbituares, coprophilia, and trannies -- original. Marshall even conjures up sad doppelgangers of Nico and Patti Smith, and makes a jesting attempt to channel Shakespeare. It's talentless imitation and no good.Spelling and grammatical errors also abound, and the book's thankfully scant 114 pages are double-spaced, seemingly in an effort to look sizable and worthy for publishing. Ultimately, 'Psychoboys' smacks of an amateur writer who somehow doesn't realize it's all been done more artfully before: by de Sade, Ballard, and Burroughs, for starters."
1,Vance Kelly,"A disappointment. Vance Kelly is an immensely talented Chicago Blues man, but here he doesn't deliver the goods. He seems more concerned with making a dance record , than a blues record."
1,Waste,My cat is not interested in these at all.. even after I put mega amounts of catnip on them. Just a zero. She had much more fun with a wadded up piece of paper. Sometimes I think these pom poms might have a certain smell that turns cats off.
1,POSER,"avril lavigne is a huge poser and should not be allowed to make any cds or anything. why does she say that she hates britney spears when she goes on trl just like britney!!!! if you want some real punk music, listen to rancid, offspring, and bad religion."
1,"Hate it, Hate it, Hate it!","This is the first review I've ever written, and that says a lot about the depth of my feelings for this bath tub. Where to begin? Let's see...the infant insert that baby lays on doesn't have a smooth transition, so baby's bottom is sitting on a hard metal bar, and baby constantly slides down while you are trying to bathe her. In addition, it's designed to slide together for more compact storage, but that's the biggest joke of all! It's difficult to get it to slide out again, and when you do get all the locks in place, and fill it with water, it leaks! You can't move it after you fill it, without it leaking all over the place, so you have to have a kitchen sink sprayer or fill it and bathe baby in the bath tub--hard on a body that has just gone through a long labor and is still recovering. We tried to make it work, but...it's now in the garbage."
1,Very disappointing,"If you are a Cello lover this CD is not for you. There is very little Cello on it, mostly Piano with a little Cello in the background. The CD should have be titled ""Romance of Piano"""
1,Not worth the $$$$,"Hmmmm...let's see, 2 good songs and 1 marginal song for [amount]! Not a good deal by any stretch of the imagination. I'm a hard-core RP fan but this latest effort is just plain lifeless & a real chore to listen to. The ""No Quarter"" album of a few years ago was IMHO his best effort since the LZ days. If you want an INCREDIBLE album buy that one instead.Regards,KTR"
1,Canvas doesn't last,"I have owned 2 of these for about 3 years. The canvas and its ties have been ripped for some time, but were usuable until I tried to wash it on the most gentle cycle in an ultra-modern washing machine. The cavas seams fell completely apart. I have searched the web and cannot find replacement canvas. It would be a GREAT product,(good design, good size; my wheels are fine) if the canvas was replaceable - or if you're someone who can sew a replacement."
1,Save Your Money and Just Buy The Bus A Bus Single,Most of the songs are plain and both the good ones were released on single. Save your money and buy the singles or a CD you will actually like more than a couple tracks on.
1,not that good,"I bought this album b/c I am a huge reggae fan and also love Martha's Vineyard. Unfortunately most of the songs on this album are from Americans, and thus the reggae isn't that good. Carly Simon's cover of ""Is This Love"" is atrocious. There are a few good songs, but there are a lot of songs that aren't even really reggae--more folk/country/blues....Don't buy this album...."
1,Be aware,"Just be aware that these do not arrive as shown in the ad. They come in generic plastic bags with no Pedifix identification, so you only have the sellers word that they are Pedifix. I expect to get what I am shown."
1,BPA Free but poor design. Better BPA-free options if you look,"My wife bought a bunch because they were (for a time) the only BPA-free bottles she found (frankly didn't look that hard)They are decent bottles yes, but there is this extra pair of pieces which you have to assemble. I don't see that they do anything for reducing swallowed air or anything else, but they're fidgety and just extra pieces to clean.It might not sound so bad but it more than doubles the amount of work to fill a bottle, and at 3 AM when you have a screaming baby, you don't want to be diddling around with the extra pieces.BE WARNED - Replacement nipples are $7.50 a pair and they last only a month or two before they need to be replaced (The holes enlarge and let too much flow out) There are MUCH CHEAPER and simpler / better designed bottles out there - you just have to look.The sippy cups are another story entirely. They are a disaster."
1,Possibly one of the worst books I have ever read,"I walked into my bookstore and saw this on the shelf and bought it instantly, knowing I loved P. Cornwell's writings. I then cleared my calender for the next day so I could curl up and read my favorite author. Well, needless to say I couldn't stand to torture myself by making myself read this book in one day. I did stick it out though thinking, surely it had to get better this is, after all this is the author of the fabulous Scarpetta novels. This has got to be one of the most pointless books ever written. I felt like Steve Martin yelling at John Candy in Planes, trains and automobiles, ""When you tell a story HAVE A POINT"
1,beware the bandwagon,"Admittedly, when everyone starts salivating over a particular musical act, I listen with a skeptical ear. So, I checked out his first two CDs and they are markedly better than this one.When my brother was about 8-years-old, he would lock himself in his room with his karaoke machine, Casio keyboard, and Jaminator and record his sessions for posterity. I found one of these tapes a few years ago and had a good laugh at his now 25-year-old expense. Now I'm wondering if I shouldn't send it in to a record company.This CD isn't the worst thing I've ever heard, but I don't think I'll go out of my way to listen to it ever again."
1,Pretty but not very substantive,"I'm not sure what expectations I had for this film when I bought it. I know that the cast, previewed subject matter and film location sounded good. Somehow though, it didn't live up to much of its promise for me. While the cast was filled with some solid professionals, the storyline and the direction--the direction in particular--just didn't cut it. The interaction between characters wasn't credible, probably because of the stilted dialogue. The location of the film - Menorca, I think - was truly beautiful and the best part of the production. Otherwise, I thought this was something that you might expect to see on cable TV's Lifetime channel. Disappointing."
1,Gimme a break!,"This lady is no Shania Twain. The fake southern accent is embarrassing. Her voice is okay - not professional material, but okay nonetheless. But she is NOT from the South - please, lady, give up the fake southern accent. This is someone who would do better at pop (gag). My friend burned this CD for me because she likes Yvette's husband's band (the Nelson Brothers). Well, save your money, people. Wait until she comes out with a pop music Cd. Or better yet, get a CD by a REAL country music singer."
1,Not a realistic movie.,"The acting was pretty good, but the story was totally unrealistic. They ruined what I thought was a good book. There are jury consultants who help lawyers pick juries, but they do not operate like in this movie. A person CANNOT get on a jury like Cusack did, just to try and arrange a verdict. All of these people were guilty of jury tampering, which is a felony, but no no one ever acts the least bit concerned that they might go to jail. What was the point of all this as the gun company could have easily gotten a new trail because Cusack lied duing his jury exam and apparently gave a phony name, ID, etc. Also, what was Jenifer Beals doing in this movie? She was on the jury, but never spoke a word (that I remember) and really had no part at all. Was her part cut from the movie?"
1,"mistakes, mistakes, and more mistakes","This book is by far the worst book I have ever read. After only reading 2 chapters I have found numerous mistakes, some of which made it very difficult to understand. Some of the scenario questions asked the reader to answer things that were not even covered at that point. I did however complete the reading of the entire book and was more confused then when I first started.When trying to contact the author and editor for comments, I was passed from one HR personnel to another before eventually giving up.I've developed technical courseware books in the past and highly recommend not to buy this book if you are studying for the CCNP Routing exam. Other recommendations would be to read the Exam Cram and Cisco Press Routing books."
1,Cottage rocker,Chair had a large mark on the back cushion. Not what I expected.Would not have purchased this chair if I knew it was so small.
1,"Not citrus, not moist!","I purchased this at a hotel gift shop in Las Vegas because my lips were super-dry due to the low humidity in the desert, and it was the only product they had (go figure). There was NO citrus scent/flavor, it tasted like plain wax. Further, the balm was very very firm and barely coated my lips to keep them moist. Not a product I will buy again. I think I'll stick with chap-stick at 1/3 the price..."
1,Sucked!,If you care for high school tensions ... this is your movie. I watched the first 15 minutes and almost nodded out. I wasted $3.99 but learned not to go for this kind of junk.
1,John Patrick's gambling books are a waste,"Books on gambling theory should help you make money. His theories will not do that, since they lack a solid mathematical basis. Take a look at his book on Craps, or ""Beating Roulette!"" (I mention this, as professional gamblers do not try to beat Roulette with any system you can find in a book).Everything he puts out in any gambling topic is ""fast food"". His goal is to sell books, not to educate. If you are serious about studying sports investing, a good introductory text is ""Sharp Sports Betting"" by Stanford Wong (who is also a legitimate Blackjack author)."
1,Worthless - I do not recommend,"I bought this product to use in my car. I tried it in the car, it eventually killed my battery. I then tried it in a small room in my cellar where the sump pump is, days later it accumulated not even a drop. If asked I would recommend this product."
1,Very dissapointed,"My son received this gift for Christmas two years ago. I was very excited as I remember playing this game as a child. I was soooo disappointed!! It is definitely NOT the sturdy game I remember from my childhood days. The hippos tend to get stuck w/the handles down. For the adults...not a problem...but very frustrating for little ones. And the ""marbles"" don't roll around very well. Overall...not a good buy in my opinion."
1,Publisher should be ashamed!,"Parents beware of the trash in this notebook. I would never call it a book. Yes, our society has sunk deeper! How sad for the next generation to be exposed to this garbage. How about the unfortunate student unable to smoke pot and still get into Princeton????? What about the student with an afternoon job and neither the money or the time to get high before doing homework? What a horrible example. How sad!"
1,Rotating tines!,"Beware folks, this is a flea comb with rotating tines (they neglect to mention that up above). If you're using it as just a fine comb for grooming, then it's a good thing, but if you actually want it to catch fleas, take a pass on this one.Rotating tines are (much) less effective at flea catching than the fixed tines and I certainly would not have purchased this comb if I had known what it really was..."
1,A short booklet,This booklet is only a few ideas taken from other Sears books. I was desperate for sleep and needed help but this didn't do it. I finally found the book that Sears recommends called No Cry Sleep Solution which is compatible with all Sear's teaching and has great solutions.
1,Exploitation,"All I really have to say is that I think this is a disgusting display of exploitation. While these kids obviously have some singing talent, they are way too young to be used like this. They'll make a little bit of money off of this(and given the shrewdness of the industry, it will probably be very little), and then they'll be forgotten. This and all of those Kidz Bop records is just an attempt by people like the ones who run Jive records to draw a younger crowd into their pop world, thereby assuring themselves a new generation of consumers. I mean, why do you think all they do are cover songs? It's so that kids will move up to the older singers who recorded the originals."
1,indoors only,great assortment of lengths and colors. Unfortunately they do not withstand cold temperatures. Very brittle in the cold. Not good for outdoor use. Had lots of success with them indoors.
1,This man is a fraud,"Were I able to give a book zero stars, I would. Aside from the fact that the book contains no natural cures (Heres a hint why: There arenent any) but its just a big shill for you to buy Kevins website subscription all the while bashing REAL medicine that actual helps people.Look up his history, you will see he has been in trouble MANY times because of the lies he tells. He is not on your side, he is on his wallets side."
1,DEAD PIXEL'S!!!!!,"I bought this thing like many other fools on the launch day and mine had 3 dead pixels, to alot of people this might not bother them but $300 is alot of money to me so I returned it to best buy and I had to lie about what was wrong with it to get a new one because if it has dead pixels they won't exchange it. well the one I exchanged it for also has dead pixels, 3 in the lower right corner and one smack dab in the middle!!! so today I will try to exchange it again and will continue to do so until I get a good one. I think sony knew of this problem with alot of the units but desided to release them anyway in hopes that people would not notice the dead pixels. well good luck with yours people."
1,I hate this POS (R15),"I hate this POS (R15)I Bought the R15 and was told it will be different from my HUGHES SD40 TIVO. Boy they are right!!The R15 is the worse POS I have ever bought. The system freeze and I have to reboot 3 to 4 times a day. One would think I have a defective unit, I sent this unit back to DIRECTV and they replaced it for another. Does the same thing!! I guess when the hard drive gets past 50% this is what happens.The unit doesn't record when you go back and forth on 2 channels like the TIVO did. When you record series you can not record the same program on 2 channels.I had to buy a refurbished Huges from e-bay I hated this so much.Bottom line, don't buy, lease or plug in the R15."
1,Items Expired,"While the service and shipping was fast, the product was not what I expected. I got the 56/57 combo pack which, when I received it, I noticed that the expiration on the package was May 2007. I contacted the seller and he responded quickly and said to give it a try, so I did. The black worked fine. I didn't need the tri-color right away. Well, now that I need to replace #57, I realize that cartridge is defective. The magenta and blue work fine, but now everything prints purple because the cyan is not right. That color line didn't even show up when the calibration page was printed right after loading the cartridge.I will never purchase print cartridges again through this seller, and probably not any other online seller through Amazon, because you have no way of knowing until you have already opened the packaging whether it is old and dried out."
1,"Two purchased, two defective and returned","Purchased the item, arrived defective, replacement was also defective."
1,"Cheaply made, leaked right away.","I carefully sealed the battery compartment, following the instructions. I have other underwater devices with similar O rings and have not had a problem with them leaking. This unit leaked at 10 feet and was not there when I needed it."
1,Blech!!,"I read many reviews before purchasing the box of Space Food Sticks. All I can say is this..... Though they are not the most ""terrible"" thing I have ever eaten, they are NOTHING like the food sticks I recall from my youth (Pillsbury Food Sticks). I was truly excited to finally find these online, and highly anticipated their arrival. They actually made me a bit nauseated, and had a bit of an after taste. The sticks tastes like a tootsie roll with a bunch air in it. Overall, bummer. My 12 and 10 year old girls spit them out. If you are going to purchase the chocolate, I would suggest buying a small quantity first....:("
1,The worst of the sigma 6,"This is the worst toy of the sigma 6.Duke looks bugeyed and unrealistic.He is A Real American Hero not a bugeyed robot.His weapons are so unrealistic ""PLASM"" in weapons how fake.The only good thing about this toy is IT LOOKS GOOD IN THE TRASH!!!!!!!!"
1,locks up under linux,"Talking to the MR814 router it hangs on large outgoing data transfers after 70-80 Megs, and won't do anything at all until the machine is power-cycled. Works fine for web-surfing and downloads, but don't expect to do backups through it."
1,Poor quality control.,"This was one of four quickstruts ordered at the same time. The other three of the set were fine, and were installed and perfromed as expected. This one part number was installed and produced a loud metallic clunk even on relatively smooth streets. It was removed and returned for credit at no shipping cost to me. The account was credited shortly thereafter. A replacement quickstrut of the same make and part number was acquired at a local auto parts store.This is an example of the kind of situation that can happen when ordering discount priced auto parts from the web. Perhaps the products cost less for a quality control reason. However, due to cost savings, I expect to continue to acquire certain auto parts on the web."
1,Hmmm...,"Where to begin. This is a guy who seems he can play guitar pretty well, so why is he playing these monotonous songs?I agree with guy who said theyre all kind of similar.Hmmm."
1,Red Rabbit,I would rather rate it a zero but that choice is not provided. Not much of a story - and what little story there was was spoiled by injection of the neocon/far-right politics. I do not expect to read another Tom Clancy since there are lots of quality books/authors out there that leave the the politics at home.
1,Could not afford an editor,"This movie was extremely slow. They obviously could not afford an editor. Its glacial pace was reminiscent of every awful European movie that you have ever seen. Not only do I want my money back, I want my hours back. I understand it was done originally in 3-D. I doubt that could save this dreadful waste-of-time."
1,Not so Good,"I bought this cd for a dollar, for one song, and that was about its value. It's not that good or heartwarming, its not bad, its just not that good."
1,Overwhelming,"This study of the Book of John would fit in a detailed college class, not a Sunday School class to explore who Jesus is. This study is too comprehensive and complicated and requires much homework. Definitely neither inviting nor user friendly. However, the introduction is well-written and points out that it is possible to select questions and focus on particular issues, but the mass of material and options are a turn off. Having the actual scripture passage printed in the book would have been very helpful, but scripture isn't included."
1,Worthless,This coffee maker worked about 7 times then quit! Is a piece of trash in my opinion. Of course by the time it quit working I had thrown away the box it came in so I did not have the opportunity to return it to where ever!.
1,Its great but...,"Dont get me wrong, this is a great album, but the sound quality is terrible. The 2cd 'Memories' has replaced this one, and is by far amuch better investment, even for the casual elvis fan. Besides, this one has some edited versions, like the gospel medley, which is restored in its full lenght in the 'memories' cd. So, even though, this is the original relese, save your money and go get the other one."
1,Nothing New,"This book is a major bore. There is nothing new in it, just rehashed stuff. Frankly I was surprised, because this guy is supposedly a great scientist.I was really looking forward to something interesting if not totally new. But all he did was to give a boring report on what physics has accomplished over the years, stuff that we already know.I was looking for maybe some new concept such as his idea of why entanglement happens. There was nothing. Nada.All he could say about entanglement for instance was, well, that it shows us that cosmic space is more than what we might think it to be. Duh!I have an advice for the author. Next time, write a book if or when you get a real cool idea about something. I mean, I--a plain layman--could write this book. Everything in it could be found on wikipedia."
1,WHY DO THEY HAVE TO SING?,"All the instrumentation they use is great. They are very good at music, but when the singing starts... PUKE."
1,Sooo so bad,"How anyone can give this even 3 stars, let alone five is beyond me.This is so bad it's painful to watch. The acting is awful. The story terrible. The music, frankly if I were black, I'd find it insulting. Plus Van Peebels' wardrobe looks more YMCA than cowboyThis is the biggest turkey I've seen in a while. It's a kids film... I think it would be ideal for 8 or 9 year olds - who might quite enjoy it. But honestly - it is sooooooo bad.I was expecting to sit down and watch a good western, with an intersting slant to it. Boy how wrong was I. You've been warned."
1,Looks can be deceiving,"I also had one of those metallic tasting cookie experiences. The dough was a little nasty, but even after baking, they tasted off. You get the ""maybe this is going to make me sick/be bad for me"" feeling that generally accompanies food on its way gone bad. What is that metallic taste?!"
1,Didn't care for it,"I guess I'm in the minority of reviewers, but I really didn't care for this workout. It was severely lacking in the fun factor department for me. It felt very repetitive (I know squats and lunges are effective, but that doesn't mean that I want to do them over and over for minutes at a time without switching things up a bit.) I do feel that it's a strong and effective workout, I just prefer my workouts have more variety of moves and well, that they are fun. This is a workout that I would dread doing again, so I will be passing my DVD onto someone else who may enjoy it."
1,Cheap Plastic,"I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED THAT THE PLASTIC CASING CRACKED. WHEN I SHAVE THE BEARD GUARD CAN SHIFT AND CUT OFF PART OF MY BEARD. SOMETHING IN THIS PRICE RANGE SHOULD BE MADE MUCH STURDIER,"
1,Don't waste your time,"This book is not worth your time. As a recent college graduate, I bought the book, thinking some of Maria's insights might hit close to home. Instead, I found pages clogged with run-on sentences, and life lessons that were not insightful at all. Her ""woah is me"" attitude got old, as all of her stories of mistakes ultimately ended in self-praise. The book was entirely self-serving, and any reasonably intelligent person with some experience under his/her belt is alreadly well aware of Maria's pearls of wisdom. This Kennedy child should return to the Hilltop for another writing course and some much-needed grounding."
1,Good Information but Code does not work.,"I found this book very informative and helpful at first. I was initially excited at the depth of the training and the real world examples. There was no ""Hello World"" type of stuff. Unfortunately when it came time to actually practice the training I discovered that the code presented in the book and the on line source, does not work. The syntax is not accurate and it brings into question other information presented in the book. I can only assume that this book and code was based on a very early Beta, and substantial changes were made by Microsoft before the current version of ASP.NET was put on the market."
1,Failed within 2 weeks,"I don't know if it had not been stored correctly or whether it was fraudullent, but it failed very shortly after having been installed."
1,Horribly written,The writing quality of this book is abysmal. It reads like a middle schooler's class paper. Not worth the money.
1,a disappointment - sad to say,This paperback was 2 books on one - honestly - I didn't even attempt the second story. I read the first story - praying for the end and threw the book away when I completed it. You couldn't pay me to start the second story.In all mmy life have NEVER thrown a book out or not completed a novel... well I guess there is always a first time and this snoozer was it.IT WENT NO WHERE - it was slow and a snore..... simply out it was boring. I am so very disappointed.I have read Stephanie Laurens for years enjoying most of her work - but not this one - I wish I could get a refund.
1,The difference between the real thing and the imitation,"Bits of Beatles,Zappa, Queen, (Herman's Hermits ?), may be laudable in intent but reveals the crucial difference between an original musical mind and a talented imitator. Elfman's themes are good but his songs have some of the same faults as your normal Musical pieces, they have fairly banal, repetitive lyrics and are cut and paste music. Has the creepy competence of a Dave Grusin album. If you like that you'll be OK here."
1,"Nah, didn't go for it","After titles, it got boring way fast, and did I mention predictable? The problem with this series is once you've seen one you've pretty much seen them all and they just get more contrived and unbelievable. The first still the best."
1,Is this a joke?,"This product was designed to protect the Jornada, but I think that it does more harm than good. To use it, you must remove the metal cover that is already on it, and the top of the leather case isn't nearly as durable as the metal. This is also drastically over priced and I would definately not recommend it. If you are looking for good protection from shock and weather, go with the Body Glove cases."
1,Disaster,"I have owned this printer for over 2 years. And I used it only occasionally. Initially I liked the outlook, printing quality, and features. However, as many other users already pointed, it takes so long to warm up or to shut down, and it keeps saying ""ink cartridges outdated"". I had to replace ALL SIX cartridges THREE times with authentic products from HP, but eventually it still failed. Now it won't start to work, nor can I turn it off unless I unplug it. It became a total waste of money and time."
1,Cute but cheaply made,"My 5 year old daughter loves my little ponies and just had to have this castle. I bought it for her for her birthday. I was disappointed that the pieces do not stay on at all -they constantly fall off. The tops with the hot air balloon etc...just sit there dont attach well, barely bump it and everyting falls apart. It is cute if it sits in her room on display and is not touched.. not worth 39.99 thats for sure!"
1,Junk. The thing was giving me high blood pressure ...,"... from the aggravation. Plus it squeezes my arm so hard it's like some kind of sick torture test. I think it's trying to see how much pain you can endure. I was fighting back, flexing my arm trying to pop it. My wife tried it and all it does is error out and make her arm go numb. I think I'm going to lower my blood pressure by going ""office space"" on it."
1,Junk,"I returned this thing within a couple of hours. It only does 24-bit in ASIO mode, so no coupling with other interfaces, unless you want to go 16-bit. The latency is terrible, even by itself using ASIO drivers. Nuff said."
1,a souvenir for Jamaica excusion?,"If this were a souvenir for their Jamaica excusion or a free extra DVD set for their brand-new CD, you might be pleased to have. But.....You'll watch a partial live concert includes only six tunes; Day At The Dog Races, Representing The Mambo, Pretty Good Love, Do What You Want, Cajun Girl and Dixie Chicken on this stuff. And luke-warm interviews.....oops. I've been a big fan of Little Feat and can say this will be a stain upon their career. I'm so sad."
1,Not What I Was Looking For,"If you are looking for Japanese accents to your home, this is not the book for you. I was disappointed as there were only very few references to Japanese design. Some rooms were overly decorated and looked too busy that one cannot enjoy the ""beautiful objects and exotic materials."" Too gaudy for me. I would much rather go for the simplicity of the Japanese home."
1,Tiny- teeny teeny tiny!,"I wish the seller had included some kind of dimensions into the description. Using a good magnifying glass, I see the charm is well made and actually quite pretty. I ordered four and decided to sew them onto tote bags to give as gifts to friends who are fans of theatre. For something like that, as a ""decorative piece"", these worked out. However, I would never give these as a stand alone gift!"
1,"Good Lord, this music is bland!","Don't get me wrong -- I'm a big fan of ethno-techno & worldbeat chillout music, but this Buddha Bar disc manages to take an otherwise exciting, vibrant genre of music and render it completely mundane and uninvolving. All the tunes are just so bland; they plod along in a very conventional, new-agey kind of way with the occasional tabla, flute or monastic chant thrown in to lend a vague exotic feel, but you just sit there wondering when the real musical journey is going to start. It never does.For those looking to explore the wide range of excellent ethno-electronica out there, Buddha Bar is not your starting point. Instead, check out some of the big names of the genre: Loop Guru, Shpongle, Banco De Gaia, Bill Laswell and Makyo are all in a league far beyond this meagre compilation. Don't waste your time on Buddha Bar."
1,not a perfect match,"The part looked identical to the one I was replacing.But it was incredibly difficult to install because the rubber seal made the fit too tight.I sanded it down quite a bit but it was still difficult to put in.Now the handle is too tight to turn so I left it on ""shower""."
1,Didn't work me,"Perhaps it's me, but I tried several times to hatch shrimp, but didn't work for me. . . . ."
1,garbage battery is garbage,Bought two blue ones. They're garbage. They don't hold a charge and the controller shuts off as soon as its unplugged.
1,a treatis on political science only,"I have read and loved every single previous Honor book, but this one truly defeated me. I found very little of the action usually found with Honor, and waaaay too much talk, talk, hundreds of pages, on politics, by Mantie, Peep, Andies, etc. This book could have been halved from its 929 pages. I found the book very boring, as Honor played a somewhat small role, compared to the Star Kingdom's political ""leaders"". I did find similarities to the current Bush regime in the USA, politically speaking.This book reminds me a lot of how the legendary Heinlein's books in later years became more and more wordy philosophy, and less and less of the actual story. Stop the hundred's pages of talk and get on with the story, for Pete's sake!!"
1,House of Bad Decisions and Despair,"If you want to read a book about people who constantly make bad decisions and others who are trying desperately to make things good but get tharted, then this is the book for you. As for me, I wish that I hadn't spent the time in this very unsatisfying book."
1,Not for Teens,I read this book and talked to some people. THis book is not for teens. It's more for the young Adult. Teens are already trying to get through their lives without having more chaos. I never did agree with Harris anyways but my friend said it was a good book. I wouldn't recommend it for a teen.
1,Better Left to Memory,"If you remember this mini-series from 90/91 and are seeking to own a copy, know that you'll be getting a watered down version of what originally aired. The DVD version comes in at 130 minutes - while I don't remember the exact running time of the tv series, it was probably in the neighborhood of 270 minutes given that it aired on three nights.So as you can see, about 1/2 the footage was cut taking out significant character and plot development. The final product is an odd collection of edits not doing justice to either the true story or original version.If you're looking for some of Benicio Del Toro's earlier work, this foots the bill though certainly not in a manner it could have with the unedited version.All in all, a rather disappointing product from editing to special features (virtually none)."
1,end this game,"Maybe i'm just stuck on nostalgia, but there is no way this film is a proper sequal to Highlander. First of all, it is too inconsistent & pays no respect to the original film or to Connor Macleod. This films storyline is almost as pathetic as Highlander 2. There is no purpose for it & its plays out like an extended episode of the tv series. The title ""Endgame"" which suggest the end of it all, is nothing of the sort as it is obvious that there are still immortals left. The character of Duncan is play like a lost soul, & the character of Connor (the original Highlander) is butchered. This film is complete blasphemy to the original. The one star I gaveit is based in the touching scene between Duncan & Connor. It is the one decent scene in this film. There can be only one, but this is not it."
1,Doesn't work for smoke,"I got this specifically to help with cigarette smoke. It simply does nothing to assist with it. If i smoke a few cigs in my room, even a day later, the smell still lingers. Other than that it might work fine, but that is the only reason I got it."
1,Don't buy this machine!,This machine is horrible! Can't even make simple projects without having multiple problems. Instructions are useless too. Buy a nicer machine and save yourself the hassle and fustration.
1,How the heck do you use the water squirter?,The bottle says take the water squirter off to get the body wash - which is fine. But how do you use the water squirter? Anyone know?
1,How to abuse and permanently damage your child,"This is a how-to book for people who want to make sure their kids grow up to be miserable, anxiety-ridden doormats. This book should be illegal and the authors should be charged with child endangerment. To recommend spanking a little baby is just beyond belief!"
1,What a scam...,"Don't buy this program unless you enjoy having to switch cd's several times troughout each project. And, now I keep getting emails from Brodebund trying to sell me one disc with the whole program. It has got to be the most shameless marketing plan I have ever seen. And, frankly, the graphics just aren't all that great. But, alas, I am stuck with it. Every time I have to make a card for another of the endless kid birthday parties my blood pressure rises. Save yourself."
1,Nothing Special,"One of the purse patterns is nice (Flapper Wrist Bag), but there are cheaper craft leaflets out with better patterns (acrylic chenille seems to be the yarn of choice right now), and if you collect vintage knitting books/patterns you may already have a lot of this stuff. The author's product line is not cheap either, and many of the projects (especially the hobo bags) look like a lot of the cheap imports available today--why put all that money into something when you could buy a nearly identical item cheaper?The clothing is nothing remarkable either, and definitely warm weather only. If you like to slice up strips of fabric with a Rotary Cutter and crochet/knit, you might be able to adapt the patterns for a ""country"" look."
1,Bent during the first day of light use,"I worked with this fork for one hour or so, there must be a stone (not big) of something in the soil, a part of the fork bent right away, and it was difficult to unbent it. Had to return the item. Thanks, Amazon, for hassle free return policy."
1,"to read the Oath, or not read the Oath - Not read","I tried reading this book because of the author's reputation for writing good Christian thrillers, and found it totally boring! The story centers around the main character investigating the killing of his brother by a bear, in a small rural town. The author builds some tension, but after reading it for fifty some odd pages, and nothing else happens, you lose interest, fast. I just couldn't get into it, but will try his other books(This Present Darkness, and Piercing the Darkness) hopefully they are better.Suggestion for Christians who like a book that moves; try Cain, by James Byron Huggins, same basic plot, but it moves a lot faster! Peretti should try reading this book to see how to write a Christian thriller.Another Good Christian (End Times) thriller is Blood Moon by Hal Lindsay."
1,Plot leads to nothing.,"The author is certainly an expert on U.S. and British naval policies and procedures, but the book ultimately fizzles. For a country (ultimately identified) and/or a world leader (ultimately identified) to use a nuclear weapon against the United States, and suffer no comparable retaliation, is just plain silly."
1,The Comic Books,I coudn't suspend my disbelief. The heroine is sent to a kids store to learn about herself. Here kids write the comic books about the events as they occur. Are the kids pyschic? How else could they do that? Alternate worlds. Superpowers and immortality --but you age? They somehow can't figure out who the heroine's real identity is but it is obvious she is one of 2 sisters and one of them is dead???? This book sucks. Women readers and Comic book fiction do NOT mix. Unless you're 13. Sad because the writer can write --she just needs a good storyline to go with. One that appeals to grown women. We need more women who kick butt stories --just keep it within the realm of beleivable.
1,Bought this 6 months ago for Desert Combat,"Bought this joystick for desert combat (only game I play thatrequires one) and I don't play that frequently. Maybe a fewhours a month - so it's not been abused.At first it worked great. However, about a month ago the twistfunction no longer works (only registers twisting to the left -not the right) - and it won't center anymore.so basically I take off in DC in a plane and if I don't oversteer - just leave the joystick centered - the plane pulls tothe right and down.Calibration doesn't do a thing.Big waste of $35 bucks. I suggest looking elsewhere."
1,Never Worked,"The machine never worked. It randomly plays the outgoing message for no apparent reason, even when there's no incoming phone call. After wading through a very long menu of options at the tech support number I got to a person and was told I'd have to return it at my expense, even though it's in warranty.If you look at other sites with reviews on this machine you'll see that my experience that the unit didn't function correctly isn't unique.Save your money!"
1,"Lots of fluff, little research","THis book incorrectly focuses on the FBI as the capturers of Ames and leaves out the mole hunting CIA team's chase of Ames. While they did mess up and take years to identify the problem, the CIA team caught Ames. THis book is also way short on providing insight into Ames motives, tactics and techniques. A MUCH better book on the subject is ""confessions of a spy"" by Pete Early. Earley is the only journalist that was able to interview Ames and his well researched book provides the story in Ames own words as well as interviews with his russian accomplices."
1,Intricately carved lions with string tails?,"This book is quite inspirational for the art work ,but it fails as an instructional work .I doubt if Mr Bridgewater has ever ring turned wooden animals! One would need years almost to complete an ark he describes .For example the intricate carving on the back of the crocodile .The very essence of this type of toymaking was a few clean cuts of the knife ,cleverly creating an animal with the least effort .with no sanding whatsoever .I think a novice would be put off carving and turning for quite some time if he/she attempted to ring turn and carve by this instruction .To sum up I cant help thinking that the Bridgewaters are very cleverly milking sources with no practical input of their own .I dont believe they are woodcarvers in their own right"
1,Particle board comes apart,"I made the mistake of ordering 3 of these before trying it out first. Like a lot of un-assembled furniture, this lateral file comes with the usual assorted hardware of Ikea-style turn fasteners. It looks ok but the problem is the cheap particle board... turn a screw just a little too much and you're toast- the wood breaks right off leaving you with no way of getting the unit properly assembled.Besides that, I tilted one while trying to move it (while empty) and the cheap plastic foot broke right off. I had to use a piece of plywood as a patch to fix it. There's no doubt this will not hold up to repeated use and am not putting anything heavy or of value on top of it. Plainly put it's not good furniture, if you manage to get it assembled it will likely only weather a couple years of use. There's cheaper furniture out there, but not by much. I spent an entire day putting together the three cabinets and learned my lesson. I will never waste my time with such cheap crap again."
1,"Book should be listed under the ""kooky"" category.","Kooky alright, mainly because of her, it seemed okay enough at the time, but we really did not want to know all that stuff. Way too much time thinking, journaling, etc. Kenny is an excellent songwriter and musician and has helped a lot of people through his songs, but the book is just strange."
1,Leaky!,"The black cartidge had leaked in a air tight bag upon arrival, the color cartridge was fine. Had to return them as a set, received credit. Return was no problem."
1,Pass this one up!,"The only thing worth mentioning about this book was that it was written by a teenager. I must commend the author's passion for the story, which is quite evident throughout the book. However, with all the grammatical errors, redundant terms, and repetitive motions of the characters, I simply could not embrace it as I did some of the other Phan Fictions. She portrayed Raoul in a horrible, unlikely manner. Erik became rather pathetic, and Christine was just plain annoying.If you want a good find, go for Progeny (by Becky Meadows) instead! 2 stars for effort~"
1,Who drew this thing????,"I expected so much more based on previous reveiws (and price). This small book (yes, it has 163 pages, but it's only 5""x7"") has line drawings that are so crude and childish they are useless. Utterly useless. Since this book is about canine chiropractic--knowing specifically where and how you touch the dog is vital to doing the adjustment correctly. You can't tell what the drawings are attempting to convey and have to go solely by the text which is more detailed than the pictures, but I feel the book really needed both to be of any use."
1,Battery life problems,"It may be a fluke, but I have had battery problems with this phone. It was so bad that I could not complete a call without the phone discharging. I was very careful not to recharge the phone without the battery discharging so as not to decrease battery life. Still, this is the second phone I have gone through in less than a year. I have spent hours on the phone with Panasonic trying to fix the problem. Panasonic replaced the phone twice with refurbished models and still the battery life is horrible. We looked into having the settings wrong to just a bad battery. I am now trying the newer model with the NiMHd battery instead of the NiCd. Let's see how this works. I am very disappointed with the customer service offered by Panasonic. Warranty means that they will only replace the phone with a refurbished model. This is true even if the phone dies withing the first month."
1,Not what i expected,"It is a very nice stock, very easy to adjust. The main problem i had with it was the end was too big to fit into the custom 98. I had to drill it down so that the gun would close properly when the stock was inserted. Then again i do get what i paid for."
1,"Hardware OK, Software sucks","The hardware works ok, but the software is lacking, the documentation not helpful and the support is non-existent."
1,doesn't work with all it's compatibles,"the battery stuck out the back, the cover didn't fit. this is a disaster.but they shipped it ontime...2 stars"
1,Lucky Me...I checked this book out from the library,"I did not enjoy this book at all and I generally like the ""stressed out mom dealing with changes"" theme in books. I couldn't develop sympathy for the mom over any of the things she was worked up about...panic attacks, daughter with a professor, teenage son having sex. It was sad her mother had cancer, but any part of the storyline related to that issue came part & parcel with very boring and tedious to read backstory.I noticed this book is featured in this month's Redbook magazine. This can only be the result of some excellent PR person."
1,What?,"Usually after listening to a cd 5 times or so you grow to like it. With this cd you don't. Its just horrible. I think there was like one ok song on it. I don't know why i bought it. If you are thinking about buying this don't. Buy: Jump, Little Children, Stereophonics, Marvelous 3, Dovetail Joint, Memory Dean, Granian, Switchfoot, Guster, Athenaeum. Anything but this. Please!"
1,Around the world in 80 days,"Unable to play - wrong zone so sadly not able to comment. A great pity, as I was looking forward to itJP"
1,Cult does not = clever,"For some reason the appellation of ""cult"" is meant to be synonymous with intelligence, insight or distinction. Certain reviewers have been convinced that this film is something of value. Look, I'm not claiming to be a seer, but judged on ALL criteria, there are no redeeming features in this film. It is horrible, base, juvenile and tedious. For some reason, cretin reviewers believe that objections are based on the sexual content of the film. NOT SO! Full-on porn would redeem this film, seriously. It is one of the low points for anyone with an ""artistic"" expectation or one in which they hope to be entertained. Vile and hideous. Dumb and several rungs lower than any other of Knoxville's efforts. And that's saying something."
1,Unusable English Subtitles,"This is an excellent series, but if you are an English speaker, you have to steer clear of this version. The English subtitles are utter nonsense. When words are not misspelled and misused, they are simply made up. Every line is like solving a puzzle. You must assign meaning to phrases like, ""I'm not shyless."" This series has some complicated political intrigue, and it's important to understand what's going on. I'm sure it's fine if you understand old-Korean, but if you rely on English subtitles, there are much better versions."
1,$.99 for a 3 minute ad.,That eliminates any savings for buying the season it looks like.I think its wrong to put this in with a season pass.
1,Definitely NOT photo paper,"Despite one very negative review, I took a chance on two boxes, but immediately returned one. Two stars is generous. I tried it on my HP 5650, which model number is NOT among those listed on the box and in marketing material as NOT among those printers for which this paper is optimized. This double negative unwinds this way for me: This paper is worse than lighter, less expensive, generic printer paper. The image quality is no better; the print quality is worse; the heavy weight offsets the advantage of two-sided printing; and the double-glossy paper jambs my printer's feeder. I would be embarrassed to issue a brochure of the quality I was able to produce. I'll revert to generic glossy premium photo paper to display photos and text. The 97 sheets remaining of this foul purchase may end up as packing material."
1,Would have been nicer if it lasted longer,"Bought and installed in May '11, stopped working Jan '12. The locking mechanism no longer locks. I now get a""check fuel cap"" warning indicator. Oh well."
1,Hiking pole review,I ordered 3 hiking poles they came in separate large boxes wasting resources. Two poles were in good shape and came in damaged boxes. The third pole was in an undamaged box but pole doesn't work as well as the other two. The protecting tip was missing and one of the tightening clutches spins and never locks down securely.
1,One of the worst movies I've ever seen,"The movie was extremely boring and had no point. The movie follows a weather man and his extremely messed up family. I swear they must live near a toxic waste dump. They are all total moolies. Watching this movie reminded me of being in a walmart on a sunday morning...Watching this movie was cruel and unusual punishment.To the people that say this movie was artistic. I like ""artsy"" movies, and this one wasn't ""artsy"" at all. Just plain retarded."
1,WOW!!!! CAN YOU SAY CRAP!!!,"A lot of friends of mine said that I should get with the times and check out Jimmy Eat World. I did, and it was a painful and frankly boring expierence. I had finally realized that the standards for music had gone down dramatically. I would say that they need to spend longer that 30 seconds on their lyrics and then possibly put away the guitars, drums, and that silent bass, and go chant their songs at a monestary far far away. However that would be polluting the listening ears of god, so I guess they are screwed. ""Sweetness"" is very unimaginative and that was about where I started getting embarassed for them. These guys were so pitiful I started thinking about buying the William Hung CD. So for the sake of every man, women, and child do not purchase this corruption of music."
1,Dangerous!,My 10 month old pulled this over on himself while playing with it. Luckily he didn't get hurt as it is quite heavy! I'm taking it back to the store tomorrow!
1,2012: Doomsday - a sign of the death of the film industry,"Without question, the most awful movie ever made. Amazon needs a whole new category for this one! Fundamentalist Christians lie and manipulate history, co-opt the traditions of another culture, and use an obscene measure of melodrama to inflict drivel on the unsuspecting viewer. The most charitable thing that can be said about this film is that it is, at best, insulting and nauseating."
1,Not as advertised,"I just received my copy of the paperbook verson of this book from the book depository ltd and it does NOT contain the lengthy essay ""A Few Notes on the Culture"" which was the main reason that I bought the book in the first place. I am very disappointed!"
1,good but hard,I like most of it but at times it was hard to fully understand. I am going to read it again and I hope to better gain more of it the second tie around.
1,This one isn't worth the trouble,"I bought this particular My Book Pro on April 17, 2007. Last Monday, July 28, 2008, it died. There was no warning and no apparent cause. I wouldn't recommend this drive to my worse enemy."
1,Very Fragile - Beware,"Tent is small and compact. However, on my first use, the large pole broke. It is made for a very, very tight fit. The manufacturer no longer manufactures this tent, so replacement poles must be purchased by a 3rd party. Cost for this one pole with shipping is $20 vs. original tent cost of $63. Buyer beware!"
1,Rubber lining sucks,"Rubber lining came out and now it leaks so I threw it away, waste of time and money in my experience."
1,No better way to screw up a blade...,"All this so-called ""sharpener"" managed to do was turn decent but worn edges into ragged, gouged crap. Don't waste your money. Get a real stone sharpening set instead."
1,Nothing very special,"This book is quite a deception. It's very thin, you don't learn anything very special and there are a few annoying mistakes, starting by RFK's name (which isn't Robert Francis Fitzgerald Kennedy!!). There are no photos and the cover picture is ugly. If you want a short good biography with photos, buy ""a ripple of hope: the life of Robert Kennedy"". If you want a complete biography, buy ""Robert Kennedy and his time"". Don't waste your money on this, but at least the author likes RFK."
1,it was different...,"I know this is a low budget movie but...The acting is rather bland. Some of the actors seem bored with their role. Also the scene with the three teenagers (two female, one male) speaking about how large they are/like it to be is rather...well the acting is so bad it really should have been left out. The first half of the movie is rather slow considering it shows one sexual encounter after another until the two main characters meet.The movie does show some interesting techniques to ummm deal with the main characters' issues but aside from a few of those we found rather funny (and I am not sure they were ment to be funny) that was pretty much all we got out of it. So we gave it one star for the humor and the other star was for the view from her vagina. That was indeed a first for us.We watched it and it wasn't something we enjoyed enough to watch again. I would rather watch Someone's Knocking at the Door again."
1,Where do i start?,"... Granted there are a number of flashy fight scenes andsome unoriginal camera work (that tries, but unfortunately fails toapproach anything like those other movies I mentioned.I thoughtthis movie was misleadingly marketed as an adventure movie when it isquite obviously a horror movie. And not a very good one. I just can'tsay enough bad things about this movie. and what was worse, it waslong. It lacked continuity, likable characters, explanation, or reallyany redeeming quality."
1,Useless...,"The product description above is very misleading, because it suggests that this product can replace a jump-start. My battery went dead today, and I used this to charge it for many hours. All it managed to do was light up my dashboard clock."
1,Mediocre at best,"Have never before provided a negative review but this is a product to avoid. Instructions worthless -- only learned by reading reviews here that it is possible to change some display settings then went to much trial and error. After getting best possible settings, main problem is still picture quality: using high quality jpg files as input, photos display with about the visual sharpness of the Sunday funnies -- individual dots very noticeable even at some distance. Not at all like what I have seen in other digital picture frames. Just arrived from Amazon and intended as a V-Day gift (tomorrow) for my wife, big disappointment, guess I better make a dash to the florist."
1,"ok, but not good for cleavage","This strapless is a nice bra but I needed it for a bridesmaid dress and it flattened me out. It also is cut straight across the top so if you are wearing a shirt or dress with cleavage, you can see the bra."
1,Unsafe!!!,"On our first two (and only) trips out with this stroller, this stroller tipped over frontways. The center of gravity is too far forward and when going over slightly uneven ground, like from pavement to a slightly raised grating or the slight ledge from street to a driveway, the front wheels stop and the stroller tips forward. The only reason it did not completely flip over, with our baby's head toward the ground, was that the rear axel beneath the handle bars smashed into my shins, both times, preventing the rear wheels from flying up."
1,Too lightweight,"I would have read this book in an afternoon had it been better at keeping my attention. It felt like a long magazine article, but without any hard data behind it. I enjoyed the author's personal insights, but I would have liked some ""meat"" to accompany it. The author tries to walk a fine line: condemning the negative aspects of urban culture while not wishing to alienate herself from those who accept it. The usage of ""I'm ghetto"" was meant to convey the fact that the ghetto mentality is something that creeps into all of our lives, but its constant repetition seemed simultaneously apologetic and a proud wink to those whom would alienate her otherwise.I was greatly impressed by the author's character. I would have liked for her to expound when voicing her well-justified condemnation of a culture that, in her words, ""celebrates mediocrity."" Perhaps a second work will fill that void."
1,Wasted my money,"I purchased this based on some other reviews only to find every track has singing (I've never gotten used to the sound)and, unless you do forkloric type dance, there was NOTHING to move my hips!"
1,Very dissapointing,"The worker at GameStop recommended this game over Sopranos and Transformers(I haven't played either). This game is a mix of very easy and non-engaging. The entire game you are given instruction after instruction about 5 seconds apart. It feels as though the game keeps telling you, ""run forward"", ""follow Warchief"" over and over. The game for me became boring after about 20 minutes. I was anticipating some further action to take place, but never got to it."
1,poor story line after the first episode,First episode of the 4th season is worth watching but after that dont like what this show became. First season is much better if not their best work.
1,Initially satisfied; downhill from there,"I purchased this handsome can opener in June 2004. Feels & looks substantial and promising. It worked ok for a couple of months, and now it's useless. I'll return to using my zyliss opener, and throw this in the trash."
1,Wandering mess,"First up I did not like this, it is probably the most boring thing I have ever had the misfortune to happen on. Also, and forgive me for this, I read only half and therefore may not be entitled to comment. The story could be interesting, if you can find it in the flow of verbage. I gave 2 stars because the writing is excellent and if you like literary rambling then you may well enjoy. I read to be entertained , this did not entertain me. The author indulges in long diversions and it can take pages after pages just to add one thought to the story. It has lots of reviews so no point in my rehashing the plot - and in the interests of brevity I will keep this succinct. This is a book to me that is over written, one that will satisfy the intellectuals with lots of fodder for interpretation, discussion and general cleverness. But I was bored, perhaps I am too dumb. But I am too old to let that bother me anymore."
1,Irksome lack of knowledge of the LYRICS,"I do like Queen Latifah as an actress. I do not like her as a so-called 'jazz singer'. Why not? Well, heck she didn't get the lyrics right SEVERAL times. Particularly in Lush Life. Gee, people, if you are gonna pretend you 'love jazz' then you should at least know the lyrics to the songs you attempt to sing. For those of us who are musicians and who have worked as session musicians, please don't insult us! It's very very very obvious Queen's 'voice' was extended, lifted, lowered and generally 'embellished'. Sure they all do it, but I expected something better from Queen. So I'm not buying the mp3s, but will go get more Diane Krall and Nina Simone and Etta James. Thanks but no thanks, Queenie. Stick to 'rap' or whatevah it is you DO do other than act. Or just stick to acting, you do that well, in a certain kind of role at least."
1,Consciousness wasn't explained!,"As a teacher in Consciousness, the only word in the book relating to consciousness was 'Pineal' which refers to the Pineal Gland. The brain isn't the foundation of 'Consciousness' and unless the mental center is stirred into activity there is no brain activity...relating to consciousness. Consciousness is an inner awareness which leads an individual into enlightenment...this only happens when an individual functions in Higher Consciousness. The entire focus of the book was supposed to be...WHAT IS CONSCIOUSNESS? From my view point it wasn't answered. If the author of the book knew what consciousness was. . . his book would have taken on an entirely different theme.Rosalie Quattrocchi"
1,POP CORE!!!,"If this is the new face of metalcore I want nothing to do with it. The breakdowns are brutally heavy, but I can do without the cleanly sung choruses. I give it two stars because the breakdowns were so heavy, and the guitar work was very good, otherwise I would have given it one star. This is extreme pop-fashion-girlie pant-wearing metalcore that the young 'uns listen to...too trendy for me, but a good debut, I guess..."
1,Boring,"Because I'm the same age as the director, I can say that this film was marketed directly for me and folks in my generation. I appreciated the nostalgia, but: my gosh this film is SLOW to develop, way slower than the films to which it plays homage. This will bore 14 year olds to death. This 38 year old feel asleep in one part. It's a pretty film, and the child actors are VERY good, but the story is sort-of lame, and the ending pretty much a let down. Folks are rating this film highly because they WANT to like it, but own it's own merits, it's really kind of boring and too slow paced to really capture the magic of, say, ET or the GOONIES. Meh."
1,Don't Even Buy This Garbage!!!!!!!!!,"This Device that is Supposed to be WIRELESS """" G """" It Is GARBAGE. I own one and I want People to Understand that they Work for about 5 Hookups in the """" G """" Mode. They then Stop Hooking up in the """" G """" Mode. Then the Only way they Connect up is in the Wireless """" B """" Mode only with NO SECURITY as in WPA, WEP, Or any thing else. I have tried to contact the MANUFACTURER with E-Mails and Even SNAIL MAIL with NO RESPONSE. I even tried to hook it up to one of there so called Wireless """" G """" Routers at a Friends House. Well it WOULD NOT Connect in the """" G """" Mode even with there Own Router. I had to Buy a NEW Linksys Wireless PCMCIA Card to get Connected to a NETGEAR Router at """" G """". So I Retried the BLITZZ and it still would Only Connect in the """" B """" Mode without Security. So What I Mean to Say is STAY AWAY FROM THIS PCMCIA WIRELESS NETWORK CARD."
1,"Bad service, bad product","I purchased this projection clock from Oregon Scientific (BAR338Pa) for my husband's Christmas present. It arrived defective, but it took two of us post-college adults reading the literature to figure out finally that it was a defective product and not just incorrectly programmed by us. When we finally figured out that the projection part didn't work, I then called the (949) area code # in the booklet to report the problem and ask for a replacement. Carlos there promised a return authorization email w/in 24 hours and instructions on returning the item. It's now been 3 1/2 days and two additional phone calls by me and still no return authorization email. With defective product and unreliable customer service, right now I jsut want my money back so I can try another product, not made by Oregon Scientific.Liza in Utah"
1,"Great Mouse, But Flawed","I've been a fan of this mouse for years. Unfortunately, it is flawed by a bad clicker.This is the third mouse I've owned, and the second to have the clicker fail after about six months.Specifically, the most used left mouse button becomes flakey over time. For example, I'll click once on a window and it will minimize as if it were double clicked. Sometimes if I don't press hard enough it will click but not hold for a drag.Would be 4-5 stars if not for this problem. <frown>"
1,Hello people this is a mixtape not an album!,"I dont see how anybody can call this an album. This is a mixtape. Lil Wayne basically freestyled through the whole album!The beats are bland and only a few of Wayne's freestyles are tight. Standout freestyles: THE MOBB, MONEY ON MY MIND, FIREMAN, OH NO, HIT EM'UP and IM A DBOY. Filler freestyles: shooter, receipt, grown man, feel me, hustler music, mo fire etc. lock and load is a boring track and Kurupt is whispering in the hook (WTF!). Its obvious that he was trying to get an up north fanbase to buy this s---. The majority of reviewers who gave him five stars come from up north. Lil Wayne's best albums are LIGHTS OUT AND THE CARTER. Lil Wayne at his worst: THE BLOCK IS HOT, 500 DEGREES and THE CARTER 2."
1,No laurels for this show,"I only watched the Laurels are Poison episode so I can't speak for the others but, this is pretty bad. The relationship between the chauffeur and Lady Bradley is too casual yet too platonic to believe , the motive for the murders weak. The ending is also too weird for me. Not to mention I had it figured out long before the end. If you are a fan of Suchet's Poirot or Joan Hickson 's Miss Marple, you will find this not up to par. Too bad because Diana Rigg is so fun to watch. But even she doesn't save this shabby mystery."
1,Picture quality in midimum light,"I bought this camera after good review from my friend for previous version which was 5 MP. This camera is more in weight and the biggest problem is picture quality when light is midium or low. It did not function well at all while we were taking picures in banquest hall with more yellow light as well as same problem when we took pictures in basement with regular light. The light in banquest hall and basement was really good enough for taking pictures as other cannon camera with 5MP did really good job where as this A630 completely failed to show good results. each pictures was yellow, I try to take it using night shot, that was even worst as there was alreay enought light. I think this camera is getting confused on auto flash.I am going to probably going to garbage this camera, it is completely waste of my $."
1,No elastic or drawstring,"I recently bought furniture covers for all our patio furniture. While it may be my mistake in not reading the description fully but this cover just has small velcro straps at the corners. All the other covers (same brand) had elastic drawstrings and plastic buckle fasteners. The cover works and has so far stayed on the table, but it is early in the winter."
1,I feel cheated,"I bought this book thinking that the author would provide the pattern for the quilt on the cover, but she doesn't. She also doesn't provide any patterns for any of her better quilts. The few patterns that she does supply are too simplistic to be worth making. Also, it's not really piecing at all."
1,You get what you pay for.,So I thought I would save a few bucks getting this cheap HDMI cable. WRONG! After about 1 month my TV began to flicker and lose it's connection to the cable box. These cables are super cheap and perform that way.
1,POOR IN ALL CATEGORIES,"I rue the day I purchased this overpriced and fairly useless item.Performance/Suction Capability - PoorDesign - PoorEase of Handling - PoorBattery Life - PoorI think that just about says it all. Bed, Bath and Beyond was offering them for $49.99 the other day. Trust me, even at that discounted price, it is a total waste of money."
1,Stupidest book I've ever read.,"This was the biggest waste of my time this year. It is boring and nonsensical. A few times I thought Cornwell was trying to draw quirky characters a la Larry McMurtry in the Lonesome Dove novels. If so, she failed miserably. I tried to like these characters but they were just too stereotypical and silly. Having visited Tangier Island and finding the people there quaint, friendly and very interesting, I wondered what Ms. Cornwell was smoking when she went there."
1,"Favorite Movie, but Blu Ray With Bad Audio...","I waited and waited for Quigley to come out on Blu Ray and finally it was available by way of Walmart, but purchased through Amazon. What a SCAM! I received the long awaited item and the video quality was not great, but certainly good, and given the beautiful scenery in the movie we all enjoyed the video portion immensely. My big disapointment was with the audio when I discovered that there was no surround sound on the blu ray. What you get is stereo like the old VHS tapes! I'm sure you'll hear that it's really good stereo, but it's stereo nonetheless. I was shocked since I don't even remember buying a DVD without at least 5.1 surround, much less a blu ray. That's my gripe and now I'm in the market for the real fully functional blu ray of Quigley when it comes out. Also, shame on the studio for allowing Walmart to do this to a great movie and shame on Amazon for not posting a warning."
1,Don't give a cent of your money to this clown,"The following line from Jadakiss' diss, Checkmate, sums up this album very well:""You ain't get shot again yet, so what's your second album about? (Nothin'!)"""
1,Waste of money,"I just wanted to gag throughout the first quarter of the book. Never made it past her trip to Italy. Did you ever just want to punch a character in the face? That is how I felt with every turn of the page. Then to find out this wasn't her taking a risk in life by going on a journey of self discovery, she was sponsored by a publisher to find herself - in other words, get paid to ""experience"" crap that you can twist into a plot and sell to the ugly masses. Shame on me for being a consumer and buying the hype. Refused to watch the movie, even when it was free on a plane because I was still upset with wasted my money on the book."
1,dont bother,"Some nice writing and photos in some ways these books are not dated, but I would look for a newer book if I was serious about climbing there"
1,"Should Have Been Called ""Some Greatest Hits""","This is a lousy ""Greatest Hits"" compilation. It fails to include the #1 I Just Wanted You Know, #3 Your Love Is A Miracle, among other top 5-10 hits meaning you'll still have to go through and buy the rest of the albums to truely have ""the greatest hits"". All together, Id say its missing about 6 tracks needed to be a true ""Greatest Hits"". It does include a couple of new songs and one is pretty good which is the only reason I can give this album two stars instead of one."
1,Disappointed,"I am a big fan of Martin Clunes and his Doc Martin series so I ordered this DVD. I found it disappointing, really quite silly plot. I plan on reselling it."
1,unsatisfied,"I bought this game thinking it would be fun and help pass the time, when I got the game in the mail I was very excited and ready to have hours of good play, so I hurried and unwrapped the game and and excitedly put the game into my console, and waited, and waited and waited for the game to load, and to my disbelief the game would not even play, kept saying disc read error. So i wasted my money and have learned not to buy games online because you never know until you get it if its going to work or not."
1,Piece of Junk!,"Purchased as a backup to another D2X SLR 12.4 that had some circuitry go bad. The internal mirrors were filthy; & the shutter release stuck quite badly. The 1st picture taken during each shoot, returned an ""error"" message. Once my primary camera came back from repair, I brought this one in to have it cleaned & to have the shutter release action taken care of. I was told that the cost of repair would be an additional $575.00 (above the original $663.41 that I paid upfront for this ""refurbished"" camera), as there were more mechanical things wrong w/ it than just the shutter release issue. I was royally screwed by this seller; so, purchasers be wary. Hard to think that the seller was unaware of these issues prior to placing it on the market."
1,Just never worked,This is item did not recharge my Ipod. If you want a display holder for your Ipod .. Buy this!
1,What a big mistake!,"This card didn't work at all. The installation went smooth on Windows XP, but whenever I attach any USB device to this card, it would not recognize at all. Getting this USB PCI card to work should be a straight forward and easy process to everyone, but not with this card. Please spend a few extra $$ for a better card and avoid hassling with this card."
1,Wiring for Pros?,"This guy is seriously overstating the simplicity of the book.Its supposed to be for amateurs not pros and while their is afair amount of information ,it really comes up short with install tips.Would not recommend"
1,This is horrible!,"I bought this for my stepdad since he really loves Harley Motercycles. When I recieved this, lo and behold, a closer look revealed that this is NOT a Harley Davidson product as the title clearly stated. No HD, no eagle, no nothing. Where the Harley Logo on the bike was supposed to be, there was a foreign language in its place. What I thought was cool buttons were actually pictures of ""Crotch Rockets"" I was told that it was new. HA! The ""red velvet"" was broken in a corner and clearly dented in some areas. I am none to pleased."
1,The book gets worse and worse.,"I've read and enjoyed most of McMurtry's books but found this one quite disappointing. The beginning was wonderful but about halfway through, the book turns into a boring and oversimplified advertisement for the magic of psychoanalysis.Bob Ray"
1,One star too many- WHAT A JOKE,"This book is RIDICULOUS. I can't believe there are people who actually believe this nonsense- obviously the uneducated people the left wing have failed to educate (for obvious tactical reasons)are the only ones who will take this drivel as fact. I am disturbed at the other reviews here- someone questioned why the media doesn't run with this information?? Are you kidding?? The mainstream media is sooooooo liberal and so favorable to Democrats that if this book had ANY SHRED OF TRUTH OR PROOF TO IT- you bet your life on it that they would report it! Over and over, I might add. The tactics of the left wing know no limits. This book is for the gullible and the people who love fantasy stories. UNBELIEVABLE - the author should thank his lucky stars that he isn't being sued for slander!"
1,Lexmark no longer supports,"this printer for the MAC. No drivers are available if you have Tiger, Leopard, or Snow Leopard. I just got one of these used and it worked fine when I first plugged it in, but when I updated to the latest OS, I discovered that this and dozens of other Lexmark printers would no longer be supported for MAC. And this was AFTER I had purchased new ink cartridges for this printer (Over $50) which are now useless unless I can find some third party workaround."
2,A time-honored classic.,"A copy of this book was given to me at the tender age of six. From that point on, it became my favorite book. Today, I am 30, and I still cherish my old dog-eared copy. Rudyard Kipling's ""If"" and Eugene O'Neils's ""The Duel"" are just a few of the delights waiting for you.Unfortunately, this volume only represents European and Americans-of-the-""White""-Persuasion authors. For a more well-rounded collection of the world's poetry, you will have to find other books to supplement this one.Highly recommended. :)"
2,Hands-Free Speaker,Was very easy to pair with my phone. Very good reception usually. Every once in a while a little feedback. The voice dialing needs some help - easily confused and calls the wrong number. All in all a much better solution than holding the phone while driving.
2,A Great Shoe for Problem Feet,"Here we have what must be an old clique - the letter carrier with problem feet. I've had weak ankles and rather serious pronation for years. Physical therapists recommended the Brooks Beast and it works for me - very well. Great arch and ankle support. As for price, I compared and this time Amazon was the best. I buy two pair at a time so I can alternate shoes every day in the hope of extending their life in the rather stressful conditions I put them through. A good bet all around."
2,Lego rocks harder than its competitor!,"This game is well better than the offical (and competing) game for Starwars!! Its got good graphics, its easy to play, it has a multiplayer AND you can change too anyone on freeroaming which is Great!! The real game is too fast, bright and blurry! Who'd want that!?!? Get the better Starwars game out of the two and get the lego version!! Its soo funny what happends when things get shifted by the force or sliced up!"
2,"Great bible, really helpful","I'm familiar w/ this bible, but did not own one of my own. It is a great study bible, really helpful. I would recommend it, with a few others. But a great source to have around."
2,Inspirational no matter what condition your marriage is in,"You don't need Hollywood to get a truly inspiring and life changing experience from this movie. It cuts to the heart of many marriages and gives hope, no matter what stage your relationship is in. It's not too late!"
2,SONG IS DABOMB!,"Bills, Bills, Bills is hottt and the snippet of Bug-a-boo is even better. You must listen to it!"
2,Classic presentation of a classic,This is a beautifully filmed version of Marius Petipa's classic choreography of Swan Lake performed by the Kirov Ballet. The principal dancers are spectacular as are the soloists and corps de ballet.
2,an earnest review,i love this movie!!! it is really funny.i love the parts when Gwendolyn (Frances O'Connor) is driveing and the bike is faster then her and the parts when Algy (Rupert Everett) and Jack (Colin Firth) fight over food (i'll try not to tell you about that much ) there are alot more funny parts !!!!!!! i love colin firth and reese witherspoon (who plays cecily) this is one of my fave movies 2 thumbs up !!!!!!
2,I'm Satisfied,"I've used this dictionary for a couple of weeks and it suits my needs just fine. It's certainly not without some faults but overall it does okay. The pronunciation function could be better - some of the spanish words sound as if they have been recorded by someone reading ""at speed"" - but I don't believe they have led me astray. Where else can I get fairly good portable pronunciation help (carry around a spanish dwarf)?Screen could be brighter but then the battery life would become a problem. A bit of a bother but it doesn't aggravite me very much. I like the conjugation function particularly well - it helps quite a bit.All in all I think this device is very good. Don't know when the next version with better pronunciation comes out, but I won't be buying it. This one suits me just fine."
2,soft and nice,service was outstanding from a company that is trying tobe the best. keep up the good work.
2,The Boy with the Betty Grable Legs,"Having been a child actor myself, I could well relate to the tale masterfully told my Mr. Skip E. Lowe. What a story!~What I loved most about Skip's life story was that he did it all himself! Travelling the world on no money except what you make at the clubs takes guts baby!Those who follow their hearts desire and explore the road less travelled always win my heart. Skip is a wonderful man, a sort of little wizard. Skip e Potter. HA! I laughed so hard at certain points of the book that I peed my bloomers. Sometimes, it was so sad I cried a river of tears.But it was always haute entertainment. I sincerely recommend the Boy with the Betty Grable Legs for all lovers of life, travel, bohemia, and the great show people and the great, great legends, (our teachers) like Skip E!"
2,I wish!,"I wish every business person would read this book and require it to be read by everyone they hire.I am continuously amazed by the lack of basic communication skills, not only by recent graduates, but, in some cases, by successful business people.I believe Chapter nine, on grammar and spelling, could be a significant help to most TV newscasters.This is easy to read, but contains lessons that we all could benefit from (from which we could all benefit!)."
2,Highly Recommended,This book is interesting and informative. The research shared by the author and his team reveals some surprising insights into excellent companies and their leadership. Great book.
2,Over all a fairly good book.,"Hello,my name is Adam Stettler and I read the book Animal Farm by George Orwell. Over all I thought this was a fairly good book. It describes what Communism was meant to be like, and what it ended up as. The book begins with an old boar named Major who inspires the rest of the farm animals to rebel against the farmer. Then Major dies and and the animals rebel. They take over the farm and start a Communist government, where everyone is supposedly equal. Then a pig named Napoleon, starts a Communist dictatorship. If you want to learn about Communism this is a good book to read."
2,If you are a prog. music fan only,"Lands End is the kind of band who can produce the greatest progressive music albums.The music is just great. It's like a mix from the greatest band like Pink Floyd, Yes and Genesis.Unfortunatly, perhaps because of a lack of fund, the sound quality may bother some. It sound as if it was recorded really fast, with no money left to work on what has be done. There's a couple of ""wrong notes"" in some of the song too. Ashes is really good. But my favorite is ""Wake to find me dead"".So, in general, AN OLDER LAND sound like a big prog jam session. You'll like this album ONLY if you are a big progressive music fan, and also ONLY if mistake on a CD don't bother you."
2,The Pillars of Creation,"This in and excellent book. It is a little slow compaired to Terry Goodkinds other Sword of Truth books, but it is still exciting. It provides a new persective on Richard and his rule."
2,actual dimensions,"I couldn't find actual product dimensions anywhere, but ordered anyways. Check out the picture I submitted above (with the broken handle) -- inner dimensions are as follows: long axis, 4.875""; short axis, 3.75""; depth, 1.875"". The item looks and feels great -- but I still returned it to amazon due to the broken handle (which happened during initial shipment to me). I'm giving it 4 stars, since it is a nice piece. But for the price, it really should be a bit more sturdy -- and not break during shipping."
2,Only beef is the price,"The season itself is pretty good, but it starts slow. Some of the extras were interesting, but not really that great. There weren't that many commentaries (Battlestar Galactica has a commentary for nearly every episode). If you like LOST, there's no reason you won't enjoy owning season 5. My only real complaint is the price. It's the same price as the other seasons, but there are only 16 episodes (compared to the usual 24). The producers and network decided to make 16, which is fine, but don't charge me the same amount for less product."
2,Radiant Indeed,"In her own inimitable SHIMMERING style, Margaret Drabble's Radiant Way, is radiant indeed. The novel opens with a grand New Year's party, and Drabble is one of the best at rendering the ebb and flow, highs and lows, of a party. You will not get bogged down in a confusion of characters because this author knows how to deftly create individuals swirling within group chaos. Social groups, whether they be society at large or a few close friends, are Drabble's forte. The reader is immersed in the ever-changing world of three women who share a life-long friendship. Join them as they make their way down the path of the radiant way."
2,Family loves these fleece sheets,"These sheets are inexpensive, yet comfortable and warm! They are a big success in my family."
2,Nights in Rodanthe,I love Diane Lane and Richard Gere is always a wonderful actor. It took me a few years to finally see this one and glad I did. Its also wonderful to see leads for actor/ess that are over forty... being over forty myself...yes we still have a love life and wishes and hope for things. That movie brought it all out. As another viewer stated..it was very real and I really enjoyed this movie..both ups and downs.A good movie to see and now I pine for the the ocean front since most of the movie was a beach house. Sighs* a great movie indeed~
2,Parenthood with a Broad and Beautiful Paintbrush,"Even though this is a book that crosses the line for some parents. The reality is that there are all kinds of ways to make a family. To judge the authors for focusing on a non-traditional family ignores the beauty of this experience. Even if China does forbid one from declaring oneself of an alternative sexual orientation, the reality is that these loving couples provide wonderful homes for children. Children understand love. They need to know that love comes in many different forms. My husband (yes I am hetero) and I loved this book for painting such a beautiful picture."
2,ONCE AGAIN,once again cherry t you have made an idiot of your self pregnancy is natural and you should just go away and play with your appropriate ballet barbie doll!This doll is gorgeous i would love it
2,Please reprint it,"Gentle Emily with her shyness and her sweetness is one of my favorite heroines. Maud Hart Lovelace makes her so completely believable...her ""crush"" on her cousin's beau, her devotion to her aging grandfather, her concern for the children who live in Little Syria and finally her discovery of love for the ""Reb"" schoolteacher make for a wonderful story and one of Mrs. Lovelace's best. Please, some publishing company executive, hear our pleas and reprint ""Emily of Deep Valley"" and ""Carney's House Party"" for us life long fans. IvaHan@aol.com"
2,Packed with beautiful b/w phots of monuments,"This is a fascinating look at ancient monuments & breathtaking natural landscapes. These b/w photos capture the essence of some of the most remarkable places on Earth. The photos stand on their own with only brief captions.In the natural world towering icebergs & rock formations stand like impressive sculptures. The geysers of Yellowstone erupt & the huge waterfalls of Canada come thundering down.You view the grand pyramids, stone sculptures, & hieroglyphics of Egypt. Get to see the Buddhas of Thailand, sacred temples of India, & smiling stone faces of Cambodia. The clarity and detail in the photos is stunning.My favorites include the Tetrapylon in Syria & the Cappadocia in Turkey. The architecture of these is fascinating. The tomb at St. George's Church in Ethiopia is also quite impressive."
2,Twilight Turtle Review,"I think it's a great product. My son is seven months old and seems fascinated by it. I also like that it comes with batteries-that's convenient. The one thing that is a bit frustrating-the stars get blurry if you have it far away from the ceiling, even five feet away, which is a normal height dresser. Also, it needs to be in the center of the room, so that makes it difficult to have it up close to the ceiling. Overall, great product-just frustrated by placement of turtle needed for optimal results."
2,writing difficulties,I have major writing problems related to my brain injuries. This is wonderful excellent guide for individuals who have difficulties transition from one paragraph to another paragraph. The author seems to understand the problems of transitioning writing. I highly recommend this book to anyone.
2,For your Enterprise Collection,This is a must have for anyone that is an ENTERPRISE (TV show) fan. They could have found better photos to put in a calendar but fans will buy anything. This would also be great to add to your general Star Trek collection too. It has all of the typical calendar features.
2,Kris is a major talent,"Saw Kris a few times in concert last year and he sang a lot of the songs on this CD. I didn't give him 4 stars because Kris really is not the best singer, but, boy, these are the best songs!"
2,"Great, fantastic, definitely worth the money!","This product is great and more people should know about it! How it works is cheap and fantastic! Instead of having to purchase sticks to use every day, you just put the spit from under you tongue first thing in the morning on the glass. Put the glass top back on the Lipstick tube looking thing and that's it your ready to go.what your doing is looking at your dried saliva. before you ovulate we have more estrogen in our bodies. You compare your dried saliva with the pictures they give you. Very very simple. I hated pee sticks because i was always unsure if the line was brighter than yesterday or not. ...Good Luck with this product!!! I have had 3 friedns have a baby or two using this --- that's why i ordered mine. This is my first cycle with this, for kicks i have used it every day and i can see the difference as I build up to ovulation. Im very happy, I know this is going to be my best bet for accurate ovulation since im so irregular!!"
2,MYSTERIOUSLY WONDERFUL,i loved this book. it was ful of mystery and exciting thigs. it kept me at the edge of my seat and kept my heart racing. at the end of every chapter it seemed like i was at the edge of my seat and i had to sit back. i didn't want to put it down at night to go to bed because it was so good. i think everyone should read it..if you like mystery and strangeness you should read this!
2,Second time around,"We had one of these previously and it lasted for years. When it finally died, we realized how dependent we'd become. We looked at the new models but have a problem with the dorky characters that tell one how to dress for the weather. We live in Minnesota and we wouldn't be living if we couldn't figure this out for ourselves. So we purchaed this one again, due to the indoor/outdoor temperature ranges and humidity, barometric pressures graph, and even the moon phases. It's very accurate and doesn't rquire more than the occasional battery change. For the price, it's a great deal."
2,THIS IS A GREAT SONG,This song is a great song for the summer...it makes you want to dance...and just have fun!! I haven't heard a song this catchy in a while.
2,Good starter kit,"I still don't know a lot about paintball, but boughtthis pack to startout with. I have no troubles with it; I think it's a great starter gun."
2,Support Your Local Gunfighter / Support Your Local Sheriff (Double Feature),"This is just wonderful!! Our family loves James Gardner and he is great in both movies. I do like the Sheriff one the best, though."
2,Kind of bad but then again oh so good,"Most of this book is kind of annoying - for much of the first part of it you wonder why Bloomfield, who was by all accounts just a brilliant guy, couldn't manage to write any better. The ending of the book on the other hand is great - featuring two pages that Mike might well have taken a mouthful of."
2,Good software- should have come with the phone,This is the utility that Motorola should have included in the original phone purchase. It allows you to download any music file on your computer as a ring tone and upload all those grainy pictures that you took to your hard drive. Also allows your USB port to become a charging station. Worth the bucks.
2,clicker training for dogs,I chose ths book because I am familiar with the author. therefore I bought the book to learn more about training dogs with the clilcker method.
2,"If you like veggie tales, you will like this one","I bought this as a gift a while back, and I watched it, but don't remember the details. But it is the same quality as the other Veggie tales videos. The veggies have no arm, legs, or feet - - but they have hands! (Weird) They manage to move about town and do things. Each story is a Biblical Lesson (Lessons on how to get along with others).Overall, this is a good product."
2,Impression of Norbert Elias' Civilizing Process,The work is a marvel of creative scholarship. Its organization and style unsurpassed. I would recommend it to anybody interested in the evolution of society and cultural history.
2,Been There-Heard Them-Seen Them,"Being a bit older than some, I can say that I have seen the Byrds, Flying Burrito Brothers, and Gram Parsons/Emmylou harris. and best of all--Emmylou Harris with a variety of others--most recently; Mark Knopfler. I could care less about all the questionable history between GP & ELH. In reality they were awesome together. She remains the torch bearer of the original ""Cosmic American Music"" theme. She defines being pigeonholed into a specific type of genre. Just listen to all the music they have made, then come to understand ""Cosmic American Music"". The people they have played with boggles the mind. From Fred Neil, Neil Young, Steven Stills, Linda Ronstadt, John Denver, & so many more, itGrievous Angel : An Intimate Biography of Gram ParsonsHickory Wind: The Life and Times of Gram Parsonsreally does make you understand who they were and are. They are my musical heros."
2,Awesome,This book has all of isaacs watts hymns for hildren and even looks like the originalInside. Really excited about the book!
2,I Robot is like an action moive to me !!!,"Will Smith is an nice actor, and he can fight in this moive. But in this moive I Robot I like this part when some of the robots came out to make way in the city. But Will Smith's leanding ladyBridget Maynaham, has an nice sexy sceen as well. The robots in this picture make me screm!!! I think you sounld go and reant that moive."
2,Loved it / Recommend it,"I love this, I used it everyday during pregnancy to relax and meditate. It takes you on a wonderful meditative spirutal journey if you let it."
2,Another 10,"Over the years I have laughed till I've cried over the adventures of Stephanie Plum. Janet Evanovich has a really keen sense of humor, mixed nicely with warm, if ambivilant, family feelings and a talent for writing a good mystery.""Ten Big Ones"" is as good a book as I've read since the last Stephanie Plum novel. I do see a difference in this book (along with ""Hard Eight"" and ""To the Nines"") and her first seven. In the earlier Plum novels the humor was more slap-stick/Lucy & Ethel. Since ""Hard Eight"" there has been a darker, more serious side to the comedy. I am a huge fan of the mystery genre and am a voracious reader, and it is my opinion that ""Hard Eight"", ""To the Nines"", and ""Ten Big Ones"" can hold a candle to all comers."
2,it's all good...,"I've been listening to this CD almost non-stop since I got it over a year ago. The R&B and funk influences are evident throughout. And though their current single ""Harder to Breathe"" is a great song, it is just a nibble of this great CD. I just saw them live and was blown away. Alex Levine has a great voice and is absolutely handsome."
2,The best,"I have every mute ever made in my case, but this is by far my favorite. We dont need our mutes often, but when we do, we dont want our fine instruments sounding like we just pulled them out of the gutter! This mute attaches with ease, stays put when not using, slides onto bridge easily and produces a clean sound."
2,Big and Beautiful Mugs,"Lovely mugs, very large size, much larger than traditional mugs. Good quality, patterns are beautiful, all different and appears on both sides. The only drawback is that they seem to stain easier than my other mugs."
2,A winner,"I am a long-time lacto-ovo-vegetarian, and was pondering going vegan. I stumbled across the YouTube videos of the authors' old public access show Post Punk Kitchen, and adored it - I went out and got this book. Every single recipe I have made has been a winner - the scrambled tofu and the samosas are two of my favorite savory recipes, and I love ALL of the cookie recipes. The only spot I have had any trouble with was the carrot muffins - and this may have been my oven's fault more than anything else.HIGHLY recommended, and not just for vegans. The food is truly tasty, and you don't have to tell anyone its vegan. I promise you, they will be too busy enjoying their meal to notice."
2,"Incredible raw , honest","This CD is incredible, raw, honest almost painful. It is listening to a master using his talent tempered by his experience. Amazing.Earlier today I had listened to this album and watched the Hurt video. The country music profession should look at the Cash American Albums to learn their roots and where they have recently went wrong. Watched the AMA awards tonight, painful..."
2,Lively portrait of friendship,The characters in the book are brought to life in a very compassionate manner -- we love them despite (or maybe because of) their flaws.
2,Best I've found so far!,"My son has developmental delays and benefits from taking an omega 3 supplement. We have seen the most benefit from this product out of all the many brands we've tried over the last 4-5 years. I didn't tell my husband I had started our son on anything new - after a couple of weeks, he noticed the difference in our son's behavior and was asking me what had changed. We will stay with this product!"
2,This booked got me hooked on Julie Garwood!,Johanna and Gabriel's story is heart warming and touching. I would recommend this book to everyone; Each of Ms. Garwood's books are well written and unique.
2,playing,I have unfortunetly got many that skip or stops in the middle of the movie. I don't have many that I can watch without any kind of problem.
2,Inn of the Sixth Happiness,"Based on a true story, this video is heart warming and moves me deeply. As a former teacher, the film holds my attention and stirs my love of the children."
2,PRAYERS,"YEARS AGO, I READ THESE BOOKS TO STUDY THE BIBLE. THESE ARE GREAT BOOKS TO READ. WITH SO MUCH GONG ON TODAY, I WANTED TO REFRESH MY MEMORY AND STUDY A LITTLE MORE."
2,Amazing!,"Bought this for our 2 year for Christmas and she has been bouncing on it everyday since! Great for balance! Very easy to bring from room to room, don't hesitate your child will love it!"
2,Paris to San Francisco,"Having just finished reading ""Paris, paris"" I recommend it with great enthusiasm. As a 20+ year resident of San Francisco and a 30+ year visitor to Paris, I was pleased with a San Francisco native's take on Paris. They are my two favorite cities in the world; OK Venice is right up there too.I am particularly fond of the Marais, which is described in intelligent and insightful detail. The description of the ""gentrification"" of the Marias is particularly compelling and I find striking overlap to a similar transition in the Mission District of San Francisco. Like the Mission and Marais, I'm certain that there are countless neighborhoods around the globe facing similar challenges. I applaud this book for the effort to make us all stop and think of the consequences. In the end however, ""plus a change, plus c'est la mme chose""."
2,A great movie for all ages.,"This movie is just plain fun. The characters are great and David Bowie's songs are actually enjoyable. After countless rentings, I finally purchased this product and I have yet to tire of it. The puppets are some of the best to ever come out of Henson studios. A truly great title."
2,SO comfortable!,"I LOVE these shoes. If you are looking for comfort, this is the shoe for you! I like to wear these as my ""house"" shoes and couldn't go without them. This is my second pair."
2,astonishing,"Celine Dion , an artist who's feelings filter into her music so delicately , has touched the souls of many people ,including mine . Her talent has once again proven glorious , in her final album ""all the way"" . There aren't enough stars in the sky that could be placed in the ranking of this album , and all of the other albums she has produced . It is unfortunate that she has left the industry , but the amount of sincerety , and appreciation that she has demonstrated to her fan's , or music lover's in general , will never be forgotten ."
2,JNC660 Jump-N - Carry,I went to jump start a car that had been drained completly for a few mounths. I was totally surprized when i hooked up the jumper and the car started like it had its own battery.
2,Great guide,"I liked the fact that this book's many plant groupings ('Dry shade', 'Fragrant flowers', etc) included color photos of each recommended plant. That way, if you are planning a whole area, you can picture how different plants would look together. Plus, they identify stand-outs in each category. There are many codes for the sun, soil type, etc for each plant."
2,a great buy,"Rich colors, satiny and soft. Not too thick, not too thin. Not stiff at all. I love it! It's well made and looks wonderful and sexy. It has a coupla threads coming out where they patches are sewn together, but that may be from my cats. Nothing major."
2,Awesome mixer!,"If you can dish it, this mixer can handle it...with quite and ease, it can take the thickest batter and make it smooth! Its an investment worth its weight in gold! Every kitchen needs one!"
2,Use GC controller on your PC,"If you love the GC controller like i do, then you might be interested in using it with your PC. There might be other adapters out there, i haven't looked that much, but this one works. It interfaces your GC controller with a USB port, and comes with a driver. I've never had a problem with it. The 'setup' utility window (from control panel/game controllers) shows you which button you're pressing so you can test it, and it lets you test the rumble feature too.The only bad things about it are that it says it only works with the original GC wired controllers. I tested it with a wavebird, and it didn't work. I dont know why 2 controllers would have different signals, but oh well. The driver came on a 3.5"" floppy to, so i suppose that could be a negative..."
2,Tells it like it is.,"I read this book straight through in a day. Two of my brothers are commercial fishermen. I bought copies for my mom and one of the brothers (he's been trying to get our mom to read ""Storm of the Century"" but she doesn't want to read about danger).I guess some folks were turned off by: a)language OR b)perceived ""anti-environment"" attitudes OR c)technical talk. Well, I've been hearing it all from my brothers for years, so none of that bothered me. Fishing can be both the most exciting and the most boring job there is. And for those people who do it, it's the only job around. I would love the chance to have a cup of coffee with Linda. My mom liked it too. No hesitation, 5 stars."
2,Common Themes,"For those of you waiting to see Pan's Labyrinth, this film serves as an excellent introduction to Mexican director Guillermo del Toro. There are a number of common themes including horror, youth, civil war, the supernatural, etc. Not particularly horrific, but suspenseful and entertaining."
2,"Dee Lundgren, counselor in Newtown, PA",As a life coach and licenced professional counselor I highly recommend this book if you are looking to focus your life in a way that makes a lasting impact. I've read this book at least twice to inspire me to continue to do what I love to do and do it to the best of my ability. I appreciate the part in which Maxwell talks about how fear leads to mediocrity. Lots of insight in a readable form.
2,A Book that touches your heart....,"This book waas one of the best books I have ever read. It touches your heart about a story of a boy who loves his dogs. The story goes on about all the things that Billy has gone through with his dogs. It might not sound very good, but I recommened it."
2,Little Blue Basket,Makes the tea taste more like it should since the water can surround the leaves instead of the leaves being confined within a ball.
2,Great book,I really liked this book. Beautiful pictures of Marilyn. Wonderfully written too. A must for any Marilyn Monroe fan. Recommend.
2,Reading this is a must!,"Although everyone has heard about spiritual laws, not everyone applies it to their life. Get this book, apply what you learn, then watch the results begin to appear in your life. Another book that is a Must to read is This Can't Be Love! by Patricia Goins. This book will have you glued to your seat!"
2,The difference,"Working with abused children for the past seventeen years, I was concerned to see evidence of such abuse in Frank's childhood. What, then, is the difference between his ability to overcome and the teens in Columbine who changed our lives dramatically? I don't have any pat answers, but I plan on using examples from the book extensively in my task of training foster parents. Letting them find their own answers to ""what made the difference?"" Thank you, Frank, for allowing us the privilege of getting inside your skin and living your life through your words."
2,not as good as version 3,"it's simple.. if you have an xbox, get xbox live. it makes every game twice as fun and has some other nice features. you can download updates not only for some of your games, but for your xbox, too.but the question here isnt whether or not to get xbox live, its what exactly should you buy? from using all 3 (the starter kit, version 2 and version 3) and the prices i've seen on amazon, i would reccommend either buying the starter kit or version 3.version 2 is only a little better than the starter kit, in my opinion.. but not $10 better. if you have the money, you want to go for version 3, but if you dont have the $10 for version 3 instead of 2, you might as well save another $10 and get the starter kit. so what the heck did i just say? i said buy version 3!"
2,Just the ticket for us,"The Laundry Butler is perfect for us - it sits across from the laundry chute and clothes go plop, plop into the basket. Then we just roll it over to the washer. My son especially likes the hanger rod to hang his shirts. Oxymoron? Son hang shirts? Must be a winner! Very good quality with typical insert tab A in slot B assembly. Be sure to have a handy man handy. Cheers, Al"
2,musical spoons,Beautiful rosewood spoons. Fun to play and great for the musically challenged who want to be heard. Great price and very fast shipping fromH&M; Enterprises.
2,Precious Times Not Forgotten,"A Fantastic Rendition of what Friendship and Life is ""All About"". You will laugh and you may cry. All because of the memories these stories will provide and remind you of from the years gone by. You see we knew and cherished several of these people or animals, during our childhood and adult life. This is a book truly worth reading because it may teach you some ingredients to be a FRIEND. selbeeP T&B"
2,Being True To Yourself,"I found the novel Celeste Ascending to be inspiring to ones spirit. The story is very truthful to the reader. Being a young women, I am able to relate to certain situations and feelings Celeste displays through out this book. It truly is a novel that is hard to put down. I had to read this novel for college and I would recommend it to anyone who would like to disappear into a book!"
2,KP1010 Review,"This machine is much better than some of the other ones we've tried. The coffee itself tastes much better and stays warmer longer. I love the cup size selections because it allows for a wider range than most machines. The only gripe I have is that it still lets coffee splatter all over the counter to make a mess. Despite the high price, overall, it's a great product."
2,Decent,"There are no wonderful mouth sore products on the market, however this is a decent product and protects you from pain for short periods of time. I would recommend this product."
2,Great router with a not so great on/off switch,"I have had this router in my shop for a couple of years now, and it does a great job. The soft-start and speed control features make it nice for hand held and router table applications. My only gripe is the on/off switch. My router spends a lot of time in a router table, and even with pretty descent dust collection, the switch gets packed with sawdust so that the contacts won't close. If you at all handy, it's pretty easy to remove and clean the sawdust out of the switch or replace the switch if the contacts are damaged from arcing. I keep an extra switch around just in case. If you are going to use this router in a table, I would advise plugging it into a switched receptacle and just leaving the on/on switch on all the time."
2,Made Well,"I was very impressed with the overall quality of this toy. Each tile is perfectly cut, the base is made well and even has a slide-out drawer for the cards. The only frustrating thing about the product is that the tiles slide around pretty easily if it's not placed on a level surface during play. Using a slip resistant rubber on either the playing surface or the tiles would remedy the situation."
2,very ironic,"dont want to spoil it but truly ironic. i wish there would have been a more extended ending, it just kind of ends."
2,love to craft,"I am pleased I bought this book to add to my collection. The ideas are good and offers interesting suggestions to break our of your routine of making your usual cards. I have made and adapted a number of the cards and constanstly received rave reviews from the reciptants of my cards. Great buy, worth the money, have no problem recommending this book!"
2,Shower stainer,Great replacement for plastic strainer I had previously. Nickel finish matches existing fixtures. Fit exactly as described and looks great. Arrived two days after order.
2,"Very, very good.","Funny, sad, and heart-warming without being corny. The characters and the sometimes borderline surreal-ness of their lives reminded me a bit of ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE by Gabriel Garcia Marquez. If you like Marquez, you'll like this book. Be patient at the beginning though - you won't realize how good it is until after it's over. But the ending felt a bit contrived. Anyway, great stuff."
2,Just add your browser!,"Definately a good reference if you are a novice to experienced js programmer. This book does make some fatal attempts to instruct the reader on how to program with js but the content of the book is in large a programmers reference and muse. This would not be a wise purchase if you are looking to learn js from scratch, although if you have some other scripting language under your belt you may find it an invaluable companion.It covers just about everything that is important and unique to js in regards to what it can do on the web. There is some mention of debugging methods and some browser issues are covered but there are far too many to mention in one book. Unfortunaltely this may be js's eventual undoing but for now enjoy it while it's here.Worth a spot on your shelf."
2,NIN,"This is pretty good, but it's kinda serious and not so punk-like, but it's ok because there are other bands out there such as blink, thursday, and new found glory that can fullfill your needs so look into new un-heard of and, or just try new bands like me and get a great cd collection"
2,Nancy Drew Mystery The Bungalow Mystery,Great to hear the book on CD. Laura Linney is a wonderful story reader. We can hardly wait for more of the Nancy Drew series to come out on CD.
2,The southwest of Europe!,Ryan Air is the southwest airlines of Europe and has done very well against the inefficient Flag Carriers over there. This book is the story of how that came about and is done very well. My biggest complaint of the book is that the print is way to small. The information is great and the stories told about O'Leahry are very entertaining. If you are looking for a sense of how no frills airlines will succeed this is a great book to read. It really explains the airline business in Europe and is a great comparison for southwest airlines.
2,By the way . . .,"No one seems to have mentioned yet, but I adored the song that was playing when Jenna was shopping at Chanel and had the green masque on. It's called ""Good Day"" by Luce."
2,It's great.... and it stinks!,"Take a bunch of fantastic and accomplished musicians, put them together in the studio and you're GUARANTEED to have a hit band with hit songs........ uh, NO! Although I can say nothing regarding the musicianship (hell, they ought to teach a class based on the playing on this album), one thing is certain: the songs themselves lack feeling, hooks or anything remarkable. The playing, particularly the guitar, is unparalleled and I often whip this CD out when a guitarist is visiting so I can watch his jaw drop. Bootsy also brings us some cool 'space bass' in spots. This is hybrid music, a little metal, a little urban, a little experiemental. It's actually a shot in the dark musically, as the songs themselves seriously lack charachter and emotion, yet a blistering performance exhibited within. Most likely will only be truly appreciated by musicians, esp. sweep-picking-hammer-on guitarists or any fans of the Collins/Worrell combo. 5-star performance, 1-star songs."
2,It serves its purpose.,"Our other fax stopped working and we just wanted a reasonably priced fax only.The phone part has a cord which not crazy about. But for the price, it gives us whatwe need."
2,The movie Fly Away Home,"My 3-year-old Grandson saw this movie on a movie channel on tv and was mesmerized. He cried when it went off and kept saying he wanted to watch it again. I couldn't find it locally so I ordered it from Amazon, and, as always, got quick service and I had the movie in his hands in a few days. Now he can watch it whenever and as often as he likes! Thanks, Amazon!"
2,I don't know how we lived without it...,"This trashcan is awesome. We have a 15 month old, so it was important to us that our trashcan be stable (ie not fall over easily) and be difficult for little hands to get into. This trashcan has both attributes and is beautiful. Wish we had replace our old can with this one much sooner."
2,Looked all over Albuquerque - could not find these!,"Product exactly as described for a reasonable price and very fast shipping!Would definately order again if we need to, have recommended to several friends also."
2,Cute 1st MP3 Player,"This flash drive based MP3 player is cute and should be fun for its target audience. We have not tried the web site, and if you already have Windows Media Player 11 on your PC, there is no reason to install it from the enclosed software. In fact, the player is viewed as a hard drive, so you can simply drag and drop unprotected (non-DRM) MP3 or WMA files. Windows Media Player is usful if you want to organize songs or sync from that program, but it isn't necessary to get songs on to the player. If you use iTunes, you will need to convert your music to MP3; Protected iTunes store songs will NOT work at all, but MP3 songs purchased from Amazon will work. Sound quality is ok, I doubt may 7-8 year olds are audiophiles!"
2,The strongest book of the series,The third book of the Witches of Eileanan series is the strongest with Isabeau asserting herself and running afoul of the Righ by stealing Bronwen.The more we see of Maya and her machinations the more fascinating she becomes. Isabeau's finding of her mother and father and the battle with the Mesmearden are strong elements of the story. The remnants of the AWL hold a powerful resonance of contemporary society and the intolerances inherent.There are three more books to come. ...
2,Greenies for my dog,"I have used them for years. My dog can't wait to get one each morning. She does a ""Greenie Dance"". She jumps around and wiil do about anything to get the Greenie. This was the first time I ordered them on amazon and I'm glad I did. I got the lowest price ever and they were delivered the fastest."
2,Great Headphones,"I bought this for my son, who is a music connoisseur and gamer. He had expected another product which was a bit out of our range. He was very pleased with the performance of the headphones and would now not trade them. My husband has since also bought Sennheiser headphones."
2,Great envelopes,"Thes are so so easy to use! And when it's rainy and snowing in the winter, they protect the contents much better than paper envelopes!"
2,Used Textbook,"Was happily surprised to get this ""used"" book quickly and in perfect shape -- no bent pages, no writing, not even worn-looking."
2,AHH elizabeth...,Elizabeth Chandler is a writers and a readers GOD!!!! She's an amazing person I have all of the dark secret books and only plead her to write more and more! I got the first book by an actdicent but I search everywhere for the others. You'll be hookedI warned you
2,"gripping, perplexing, and imaginative, sheer genius!","After reading this book, you will be more conscious of yourself, your surroundings, and how precious your life is. You might even understand the role of humans on earth, what makes us different... Just when you think the characters can't get into any more trouble, Crichton takes their desperate situation and smashes it to pieces. It is amazing. Sometimes it gets a bit on the technical side, so if you don't like to read about a lot of scientific information, this book might bore you a bit, yet for those who are interested in the sciences, Crichton manages to take the most advanced perplexing concepts and explain them to the reader with extremely suave. The ending is superb, and I must advise any one who likes science to pick it up today!"
2,Fantastic yet real,"I absolutely loved this novel. The fact that Jo was such a strong woman, who had accomplished so much, was key. But the best part for me was some of Sue's writing, in which she/Jo expressed feelings I've had but have not been able to put into words. They were REAL feelings/fears/revelations, even in the context of this fictional work. It really blew me away. I've tried other Sue Miller books and not been as connected; this one really hit home for me."
2,JT revisited,"If you think you already know JT, listen again! Catchie tunes, amazing messages and of course, ingenious musicianship.These songs enter my head at random and flow out my heart and lips.....""Lord, have mercy on the frozen man""........"
2,I could not put it down!,"I found Mr Barnes account of his life as Thomas Andrews to be powerfully moving to me. His explanation of the ship's collision with an iceberg is very believable. As a former Navy man who was stationed on 2 LSTs and 2 Aircraft carriers I know how badly a ship can shake when the engines are reversed. It sounds like the propellers are moving marbles when that happens. Also when the ship struck the berg, it added to the stress of the ship that was already stressed due to the cavatation of the propellers, Also the brittle steel was also a contributing factor too!"
2,"Hereticus, the last book of the Eisenhorn trilogy","Hereticus, the last book of the Eisenhorn trilogy, probably the best story to come out of WH40k so far. It's the story of the Inquisitor Eisenhorn. The book is rich, lavish and vivid in details, and it brings the book to a ""reality feel"" (and that's hard to do in a fiction). I gave Hereticus 5 stars, since it brings back an amazing story (Xenos style) and has lots of twists, the first half of this book is amazing, and is the best part of the whole trilogy, it has a unique reality feel, it's sad that the Eisenhorn trilogy had to stop here, Dan had finally the perfect balance of story telling, description and style with this book. The book will please anyone from a new fan to a old WH40K expert. It should be noted that a minimum, or basic knowledge of the WH40K universe and the previous books Xenos and Malleus is required for a full appreciation of this book."
2,Still a great story,"I have not heard about this movie until a few weeks ago that my partner convinced me to buy it and I have to say I loved it.It came out originally in 1983 and it introduced many people to the world of computers and hacking... you know, that era when not everyone had a chip on it's ear called a bluetooth and the internet was a myth for many people????Although of course technology has advanced dramatically and there is no cold war with the USSR anymore, the bottom line of the story is still pertinent:Shall we trust computers to make decisions? and is there a point to the risk of nuclear war????This is a funny, entertaining film which at the end of the day, makes you think about life."
2,Plenty of Nona,"Includes most of her well known songs, and has songs from every solo album that she made, even including 2 from her 1977 solo debut, the blistering rock of TAX EXILE, and EVERYBODY WANTS TO BE SOMEBODY. Most of the RCA singles and album tracks are the edited versions, probably due to time limitations of a CD. It's great to have these songs on CD. It even includes an edited version of a Labelle song that Nona sang lead on, from their last album, the indescribable A MAN IN A TRENCHCOAT [ VOODOO ]. The only quibble I have is that the label [ Razor & Tie ] put on the long version of BUSTIN' OUT, which lasts almost 9 minutes & features long instrumental passages . They should have put on the 3:45 minute single version that is to the point and packs more of a punch. It would have fit on another song, like TO THE BONE , LIVING ON THE BORDER or DO WHAT YOU WANNA DO . Classy liner notes & packaging with the many faces of Nona to view, as well as hear. Other than that - no complaints!"
2,ooooh aaaah,after completely reading this book it gave me the urge to romanticize my lover Ling Ling all night till morning long. this book illustrates the ins and outs of master the way of the tongue. it shows how to use the vibrant tongue muscles that i never knew i had. now i get to taste the oh so sweet nector of Ling Ling which is the ultimate cloud 9 in my life. Ling Ling can't get enough of my vibrant tongue. when i get home from work she is preparing herself for me to go down on her. i think i'm going to have throw away my gym membership because i get all the workout at home nowadays. Man this book is so great! =)
2,Must see movie,"Food INC is a must see! It is very well done, it keeps your attention while giving a lot of information about the sad shape of America's food industry. This is a film that you will want to tell your friends about, after watching it you will understand junk food like never before! Enjoy!"
2,Cast Pins Story,"Here's an example of an assortment of fine actors, and a dedicated and imaginative director, overcoming a sloppy script. Once the Hemingway material was used up the screenwriters emptied the sack of film-noir spare parts in an effort to keep this vehicle running: the fight game, the big heist, the prison cell buddies, the nightclub shootup, the chanteuse, the double-cross. But just watching the actors delivering their lines and director Robert Siodmak's lighting and camera work make it worthwhile. And you'll never see better black and white cinematography than here. Burt Lancaster is pretty awkward in his first film, but he gives a glimpse of the power and screen magnetism he later devleoped."
2,Best type of money clip,"This is one of the best money clips made. This replaced one I had for over ten years. A minor problem is that they didn't make it to hold to many bills. I normally carry quite a few singles. I've had to reduce the number I carry to accomodate this clip. Of course it might expand with age. But, it'e still the best type of clip. The magmets make it easy to open."
2,An excellent beginning to a wonderful series,I enjoyed the first season of Private Practice. I had forgotten how much the characters appealed to me. I will be buying more seasons in the future.
2,Brilliant,"This is a brilliant album from a soulful, talented woman. Her happiness seems hard-won and real, and somehow the music knows this."
2,Mean Girls- a must see,"Mean Girls is an emotional bomb. Filled with love, hate, sorrow, and happiness, all viewers will be emotionally drained. Lindsay Lohan and Rachel McAdams play a dynamic duo. The friendship and love created by these characters will cause tears to come to your eyes. Mean Girls takes place in Evanston, Illinois. Lindsay Lohan plays Cady Heron, a student, who tells her story about her Junior year of high school. Cady is a character who is loved by all. Her achievements in public high school out weigh those of persons in the free world. Cady hurdles many obstacles in North Shore but always seems to be heroic in actions. She helps a classmate get her revenge, she helps a group called ""the Mathletes"" win a contest, and most of all she helps other classmates find what makes them special. A heart warming film, Mean Girls receives two thumbs up."
2,Replaces my Hatteras,This hammock is as good or better than the Hatteras I replaced. The Hatteras is great and lasted a long time but I can just tell that this is of the same quality and about $20-$40 less in price. Recommended.
2,Awesome service,I love that my items arrived earlier than was scheduled and no damage! I would recommend to friends and family!
2,Built to take a beating,"When I received this hose I was disappointed at first that it didn't have the large rose-shaped hand nut that some other models have for connecting to the tank. But it connected easily enough and worked perfectly to run my Coleman camp stove during the Hurricane Sandy aftermath. After reading complaints about the fragility of those handles, I'm happy with this model's rugged construction - it'll be there when I need it."
2,Good Beginner Race Set,"I found this is not a bad toy for children who enjoy Hot Wheels and other fast toy cars. The review above is just not true. Any toy can be broken if handled incorrectly, and the directions are fine. This toy is no longer sold in Wal-Mart, Target, etc. because Corgi has taken it out of mass stores, and placed it in smaller retailers because of deep discounting practices. This is not an expensive item at $20 or less, but other larger retailers want to bottom it out making it not worth producing. Purchase this item with confidence, and don't pay any attention to those who just wanted to be too rough with their toys."
2,Beautiful lullabies,"We played this CD for our daughter nightly once we started to establish a bedtime routine for her (around 6 months old) until just after she moved to a ""big girl"" bed. It gave her indication that bedtime is here. We loved it-- it's gentle and sweet, for adults and kids alike. I gave a copy to our daycare, and they love it, too. A wonderful break from the standard stuff, and nice exposure to other cultures.."
2,wireless headphones,Very pleased with the product. Good value and quality. I am especially pleased with the fact that it came with rechargeable batteries that charge while the headphones are on the stand.
2,"great story, wonderful chemistry","I put this on, not expecting much, but was immediately swept into the story by the mocking admiration that Mitchum and Greer immediately display. They are electrifying together and, though this is kind of a comedy film noire, they are truly believable. I loved watching them as the caper got more and more complicated. In classic noire mode, what you think in the beginning is completely transformed by the end.There are many things that make this special. I particularly liked the intelligent mexican cop, who decided to let the big boys fight amongst themselves on behalf of his own unknown agenda. He is learning english and makes hilarious mistakes, all the time charming the murderous protagonists in a game of cat and mouse. The location also makes it very fun, in Mexico where the gruff Mitchum must struggle to communicate while the amused Greer looks on in comical superiority.Warmly recommended. This is one of the best film noirs I have yet seen."
2,ONE OF THE BEST BY SAMMY,"THIS IS A FANTASTIC CD. THE FIRST TIME YOU HEAR ""A STRANGER IN TOWN"", YOU WILL BE SO GLAD YOU BOUGHT IT. AS USUAL, SAMMY BRINGS HIS OWN SPECIAL INTERPRETATION TO ANY SONG, AND THERE ARE A FEW GEMS HERE WRITTEN BY ANTHONY NEWLEY THAT SAMMY REALLY DOES JUSTICE TO."
2,Good Ladder,"I bought this ladder to change outside floodlights which are at about a second story level. The ladder did not quite reach that far, so I purchased a 24 foot ladder. However, I have used this ladder to change the outside light in front of my house which is at a one story level. The ladder worked well for that purpose. The ladder is easy to operate and not to heavy to move around."
2,wow!,"This guy is amazing. The songs are played with passion and he is incredibly talented. It is somewhat reminiscent of Josh Groban or definitely of Lucia Micarelli's ""Music From a Farther Room"", but he has a style that is all his own. Every song is fabulous and they sound different from one another. The first selection is especially outstanding and he wrote it himself! This a CD you have to get and will enjoy forever!"
2,Absolutely the best for the price!!,The best undistorted frequency response down to low bass in an earphone of this size & price. I've used these for 20 years - three pair so far and I now need another because the cable tends to wear out with heavy use every 5-7 years. These are full frequency-spectrum and dynamic range with no compromises. The icing on the cake is the wearing comfort provided by the unique design which allows them to rest on your cranium and not pinch your ears which I find fatiguing with all other on-ear headphones.
2,"Review of movie ""Living Proof""","I am currently receiving Hercepton for HR2+ breast cancer. I had no idea how important the IV medication is until I saw this movie. I believe it should be watched by everyone receiving Hercepton and their families and love ones. Harry Connick, Jr. was great as were the women in the movie. My friend said she cried when she watched it with her daughter. I cried and cried, for about a half hour after the movie was over, because for the first time I realized how lucky and blessed I am to live in a time when this medication is available. This is not fiction. It is a dramatization of real events. It also makes you aware of how important medication trials are and how brave the participants are. I purchased 3 copies to be certain all my loved ones watched."
2,Not the biggest or most absorbant but just right.,I bought these just to spice up the tennis outfit. First impressions are that they weren't the longest or as thick as some of the other brands i bought.Until i wore them. they get the job done and look the best while doing it.Now this may mean they wont last as long (month-wise) but in terms of fashion and price I think it's good. looks great.I wouldn't go a full two set match in anybody's wristband so you might as well stock up on these instead.I tell you perfect size and thickness for tennis outfit.
2,Execelent book about finance!,"at first i thought this book was not going to be intriguing. I even had trouble picking it up for the first time. I simply chose it because it was highly recomended. It did not fail, it wasa great book amazing stories, and anyone can follow its steps to financial freedom"
2,Hawaiian Heaven,"My wife and I were married on the Hawaiian island of Kauai in 1997 and it really was a once-in-a-lifetime experience. Whilst waiting for our return flight I was browsing the music stand in Honolulu airport and came across this CD. I bought it but had to wait until we returned home before I could play it. To be honest, I wasn't expecting much from something picked up from a music stand in the airport but this blew us both away. This was EXACTLY what we wanted. It was the true blend of gentle Hawaiian music that is popular on Kauai. This is a fantastic CD to relax to and it always brings the memories flooding back for us both. You don't have to of visited the Hawaiian islands to appreciate this though. I really can't recommend this CD highly enough - its just a shame that Amazon dont have any track snippets available for this cd <hint, hint>."
2,Fundamentals of Management,I am very pleased. I received the item in a timely fashion and in good condition.
2,worth every penny,We have gotten other blankets at a lower brice but if you want to stay waem this is the ticket it works great and the pre heater sure is nice. This is a very nice blanket and will keep you warm.
2,"Cheap, but gets the job done.","This is a cheap set of tweakers and jewelers screwdrivers. Honestly it is cheap and the plastic is flimsy so I would not recommend for any sort of hobbyist or professional, but if you need to do some minor repair to your cell phone or tighten the screws on your glasses from time-to-time, this set is more than enough to do those small, once-in-a-while jobs."
2,"Rough waters ahead, around, or behind you?","This could help! Helped me, at least. Of course, there are two kinds of people in the world: those who get it, and those who don't. If you don't understand this, consider yourself one of the latter.Godspeed!"
2,Great!,This book is very special. It's definitely for more advanced players of the native american flute. But it's very clear and interesting and has some very beautiful and inspiring music to learn.
2,Great for the price.,"PROS: I got this wheel to replace my Alex R500 rear wheel on my Motobecame CX Phantom after my axle got bent somehow. This wheel has a slightly less beefy rim (although wider), but the whole hub assembly is monstrous compared to my original wheel. I don't think anything I can do will bend this axle. highly recommend.CONS: Putting on my old gear cassette gave me a few issues, since at first it didn't fit. It ended up with a really tight fit, so have patience when installing."
2,Tear jerker!,"What a movie! It was quite compelling and very well done. I sat in silence for a good five minutes after it was over, ""shaken"" by the story and reflecting tragedies of the Holocaust.Told through the eyes of the children of a Nazi Commandant, this is a sad twist of fate for two young boys who befriend each other through the fence surrounding a concentration camp. Keep the tissues close by!"
2,"I will forget it quickly, but, neverthless.....","My problem with Steven Saylor's ""mysteries"" is that they are not, in any meaningful sense, mysteries: as a sleuth, Gordianus is little better than mediocre, and we are not able to see him, in any way, developing anything approaching a trail of sustained thought allowing him to unravel a complex, dark intrigue; what matters in the Roma Subrosa novels is the sensitive reconstruction of the historical setting of Late Republican Rome, which, in the larger novels, always gives the impression of physical accuracy, as one almost feels that Saylor is describing living experience - not a lesser accomplishment when you think of it. Therefore the fact that, in this short-stories volume, one feels the absence of the usual broader historical canvases;neverthless, there's always a reasonable amount of savvy, racy, lush, almost physical prose that allows for sustained interest and makes it impossible to put down the book."
2,"""I nearly died...""","Beatles for Sale by The Beatles is considered their worst album but I truly enjoyed this clever mix of country influenced, blues rocking disc. Mr. Moonlight is not their best cover but the way John Lennon sings and belts this song sure as hell makes up for it. No Reply is my favorite and best track, even the band Garbage stole a line and the hook from this song. Other songs I cannot get enough of are: I'm A Loser, Baby's In Black, Rock and Roll Music, I'll Follow the Sun, Eight Days A Week, and Every Little Thing. Ringo sounds absoutely adorable on the track, Honey Don't. George gets a chance to shine as well on the closing track, Everybody's Trying to be my Baby. I love the way George attacks this song both vocally and performance wise, and Paul continues to grow with his song writing ablities. Beatles for Sale is defintely an album every new Beatles fan should have. Have a ball with this one!"
2,Splatter With A Conscience...,"SAW 1-3 are classics, each improving on the last. 4 and 5 are slapdash, rehash, and unsatisfying. I had extremely low expectations for SAW 6, so low that I barely even thought about it. Well, I've seen it now and let me say it's a breath of ""flesh"" air! Yes, there are the abductions, the mutilations, and those wondrous killing contraptions! However, this time out, we get a social / moral message that re-invigorates the whole wicked series. It's ALWAYS nice to see the return of Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) and Amanda (Shawnee Smith), even in ghostly flashback sequences. Also, whereas 4 and 5 seemed pointless and overly convoluted, SAW 6 is a true return to form w/ a hint of conscience thrown into it's meatgrinder of retribution. So, if like me, you've longed for SAW to either get going again or stop the madness, you'll sing hallelujia after this one!..."
2,No more burned food for dinner !!!,It's worth of investment. I don't have to worry about burning the dinner anymore just simply set it and forget it.It's good for working mom who does not have a lot of time waste on cooking.
2,a refresher,This Book Is great very easy to read and plus an refresher in my grammer. I highly recommend just to read . Especially if your in colledge or just to freshin up on your grammer.
2,"If you want to look your best, read this book!","This book has great ideas for building closet capsules. There are illustrated capsules for business, casual, evening, creative, high fashion dramatic, and feminine romatic. A personal style quiz will help you to determine your best style. ( i.e. Tailored Classic, Sporty Natural, Feminine etc...) This quiz is followed by definitions and examples of the styles. In addition the book covers accessories, makeup, shopping, clothing care, packing for a trip, closet control and much more. Everytime I read this book I discover something new. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to look their best."
2,A Girl That Is Going To Be Around For A Long Time,"This is one of the best albums of 2006.Rihanna will be around for quite some time.My favorite tracks off of ''A Girl Like Me'' are ''Unfaithful'',''We Ride'',''PS [Still Not Over You]'' and ''Million Miles Away''.Rihanna has a nice set of pipes at the age of 18.I can't wait to see the video for ''We Ride''.Anyways cop the album its definitely worthed."
2,"A really good game, just a little repeating...","Now, The Godfather - The Dons edition really is a wonderful game.It have great graphics, a long playtime (15hours+), nice missions, great weapons and a huge map.People who liked the GTA series would probably like The Godfather, since many ofthe features are the same. You can walk anywhere you want on the map, walk insidebuildings whenever you want (a lot more than in GTA) and you can do whatever you want to.The bad part thought, there's always one, is that the game is a little to repeating after havingplayed it for hours, businesses have to be taken over, again, and again, and again (there is over 50of them so think about it) and you have to talk to the same people for the 20th time or kill the 10000thmafia mob.But overall, the good things make up for the repeating in the game. Try it, it's worth it."
2,excellent,Once you start reading you can't put it down. Strong stuff.Henry Baum is the real thing. It would make one hell of a motion picture. Can't wait to see what else this writer does. A natural. I gave it the highest rating and highly recommend it.
2,Very Good For Eyes & Memory,I have been taking this for well over a decade. I can't prove it but I believe that it has kept my eyes from going bad as fast as normal aging dictates. This compound is supposed to be the basic component of all the cell membranes in your body. It is especially good for the nerve cells in your body because they heal more slowly than other cells. It is an expensive supplement. I have found good prices for it at Amazon. The best source of it from nature is supposed to be white beans such as Navy Beans or Great Northerns. Lecithin is Phosphatidyl Choline; Not as valuable a supplement but still good for you too.
2,Always love Wai Lana Yoga,This dvd is really helping my back feel better when I use it. I keep this in my weekly rotation
2,"Great writing, not so practical","Good guide to Venice, especially if you're into art and can speak Italian.Has good tips on where to eat, but largely mum on many practicalities.Book is organized well, but in the wrong way. Needs more down to earth details all in one place to make planning easier (like should one purchase a museum pass). Not much of a tour guide for the major sights, mostly just flowery descriptions.Overall though, lots of info packed into the guide, as long as you take your time to read through it."
2,"Little, Stylish -n- Really rocks!","I buyed this MP3 player about two weeks ago, firs of all let me say it's wonderful, this LITTLE player holds up to 30 minutes of the music u want, another point is that it's so light, it only weighs 2 ounces, god, my old walkman weigh theree times that!!This little baby from Samsung electronics only uses 2 batterys, and the battery lifetime is not acceptable, it's really impressing, up to 8 hours! it includes a 32MB memory, it's not the most great storage quantity, but for me it's ok, it's really easy to transfer the songs to the player, and the transfer rate is quite fast. Add all this fact and youll have the best MP3 player you'd ever see, the Samsung Yepp Hip Hop 32MB Digital Audio Player, the best lookin' MP3 player you could buy."
2,A nice change,"I've enjoyed every mxpx album, including their more poppy Everpassing moment. It was cool to here that they'd becoming out with some harder stuff, however. The cd contains nine songs, six which are harder/faster than their last major release, and three which maintain the sounds of the Everpassing Moment. All in all it's a good cd with a good variety."
2,Great dark comedy that takes place in an unforgettable era,"I happened to really, really like this movie. This is the only way of getting it in widescreen, other than the laserdisc, which is probebly long gone. I was dissappointed that it wasn't encoded with AC3 sound, as it says on this page. But the movie really doesn't require 6 channel sound for enjoyment (as Star Wars does require it). George Lucas has a great sense of humor that people seem to ignore and take shots at...I feel sorry for them, they miss out on his humor. Great work."
2,"Something Old, Something New...","A prince fan for 20 years, this album is a pleasant return for the artist back towards really exciting music. Prince's guitar is back, as is the voice of God (or the Wise One) from Temptation from Around the World. It harks of Quincy Jones. Prince is reveling in God again which he has a long history of, maybe his new found faith (he's a Witness now), is young, but building a song like ""Willing to Do the Work"" pay homage to God, James Brown and makes me want to go door to door, frankly. He seems to be regesturing at his roots of Jones, Brown, Gospel, Jazz and identifying strongly as Africa American. I always though Prince's music was best was he was riding a stint without a female figure. The performance, composition and production shine."
2,Good for the Troubled Teen,"This is another book that is often read in schools and I'm glad because it was a good book. I've read it many times since then. The two young teens who are main characters in the book are troubled teens. I'm not saying that this book will make things better or give you the answer or anything, just that you might like it if you are troubled.To those of you who are studying it in school right now, I know it might seem stupid, but stick with it. Actually read it, enough to retain it. As you get older, I think it will come back to you at certain parts of your life."
2,Life changing!,I'm really grateful to have come across this book. Will try and use the methods taught to change my life as well.
2,Great toy!,"My dog got this mouse toy for Christmas in 2007, no matter how many other ones he has this one is his favorite. He loves! I am getting more than one this time because it is hard to find it in any other pet store."
2,Teacher's Point of View,This a great video that follows the original book fairly closely. It does leave out some key scenes but it does not change the book. The scenes left out however are the main ones that cover the theme of the book with Buck learning what the Call of the Wild is and how it affects him. I do highly recommend the movie as it is close to the book.
2,Tried every diaper it seemed like,I have literally tried every diaper for my son there is out there... these seem to stuck with him the longest... The only problem I am having now is that he moves around so much that the diaper comes undone sometimes if he's not wearing pants.. .even tried a bgger size and it still does it.. I guess my child is just way over active...
2,"love, devotion and selfishness.........","Two tales of love, devotion and selfishness ,that occurred a hundred years apart, mirror each other in an amazing story. Beth Gutcheon weaves this novel carefully and with great patience. An elderly woman begins to reveal the story of her life during a memorable summer and suddenly you find yourself drawn into a tale that weaves past and present into an inescapable quest to understand the human heart in all it's vagaries. The mood is dark and intensely personal. The characters are raw and unrefined. The story twists the emotions and penetrates straight to the heart."
2,Super product,I was very pleaased with the product and shipping time. At half the retail price I would recommend this to everyone.
2,WOW,They would keep you from feezing if you got stranded or lost. They are compact and I am keeping some in my home and all my cars in case of a emergency.
2,Best Portrayal I Have Seen,"I have been studying the Holocaust ever since I was in the third grade, mostly because that's about the time that I read Anne Frank's diary. It has always been a very moving story to me. It has inspired me to read volumes about others who were in the same or worse situations. I have seen other movies about her, but this was by far the best portrayal that I have ever seen. Hannah Taylor-Gordon was Anne Frank to me. Every character that was selected to play in this movie was excellent. As to the scenes in the concentration camps, I think it is important to educate people about what happened. Some people say that it is a little much, but you know what, you can't change history. That is how it happened, horrible as it is to watch. Many of the survivors are beginning to die and if people aren't willing to pick up a book and read about it, I think the best way to educate people is to show them. Nothing like that should ever happen again. Never forget."
2,The Best Romantic Album I Own,"I've read reviews by some Jazz purist regarding this album. They have a point. But I hope that they would agree with me that for an album of Romance, this is the ticket. Very well done it puts me into a dream state where my lover and I can ""Face the Music and Dance"".I wrote this when I was in love with a beautiful woman named Ronnie . Now I have little use for this album. It's for lovers not for hermites like my self."
2,Better than original,"Nunchuk functions well just like the originals,but underside has matte finnish that improves grip. Very satisfied."
2,Wake-Up Call to Biblical Christians,"Though well written, American Prophecies tends to jump around and is definitely not in chronological order. This may create confusion for many readers. For Christians, who are biblically illiterate, this book won't mean much.For those who have studied the Bible and, in particular, the prophetic tellings of the Old Testament and New Testament, much of what Michael Evans writes will still be of great interest. He places events and times in context with all presidents under scrutiny for their public words on the subject of Israel and then follows with what actions occurred on their watches.Though God has blessed America mightily, it is sad to realize that America, blessed by God in the beginning, is now under a curse for cursing Israel.What we are left with is an appeal to ""Pray, Pray, Pray!"""
2,Great ID book for those new to the field,"I found this book to be straight forward in its explanation of the ADDIE model of instructional design. It breaks it down by first introducing an overview of the model (the concept) followed by close examination of each component.Each chapter is concluded with an exercise that demonstrates what was taught and then an opportunity to apply what you learned to exercises on your own.I recommend this as a great ""starter book"" for anyone interested in the instructional design field."
2,Dogs can be more than pets!,"This book was provided to me by Zig Ziglar's daughter Julie after I had met her at a conference with her father Zig. Having this book signed by Zig made the incredible book that much more special. Zig Ziglar is one of the most inspirational speakers and authors that I know, and I highly respect his work, approach and integrity.Conversations with Dogs is a beautiful book whereby Zig shares powerful and heartfelt life lessons through the conversation he has with his dog, his trusted friend who loves him unconditionally and listens attentively to Zig.Zig shares the many roles that our dogs play in our life such as trusted confident, play mate, comforter, foot warmer, and more.Charmaine HammondHammond International IncBest selling author of On Toby's Terms,Toby the Pet Therapy Dog & His Hospital Friends"
2,Great Small Snowblower,"This is the first snowblower we have ever owned. We chose electric to avoid the hassle of maintaining a gas engine that will sit unused for 6 months. We assumed that the snowblower was operated by a rechargeable battery and were VERY surprised to find that it is not. It requires an electrical extension cord. While the snowblower works great, it is awkward to use it due to the power cord. It feels kind of like vacuuming but you don't dare run over the cord! We do really like it even given the challenge of working with the power cord. We would definitely recommend it to anyone who is willing to work with the power cord."
2,A Must for Nicholas Cage Fans,"""Red Rock West"" is a very, very quirky film, which never steps outside the bounds of hard reality. This is one of my favorite (small) Nicholas Cage films. There are no special effects here. Everything is carried along skillfully with the pure acting talents of its four main characters. Cage gets caught up in a somewhat complicated plot between a married couple who both want to murder each other. Adding to the threatening mayhem is Dennis Hopper who is in top form as a killer-for-hire. Who has the upper-hand at any given moment shifts around, but other than Cage, it's topsy turvey over the motives of the married couple, and exactly what Hopper will settle for. The ending is right on the money. The moral of the story may be that if your a down-on-your-luck drifter passing through Texas, you might want to think twice about any easy jobs that seem to fall into your lap."
2,Not a bad start for couch potatoes!,This was not a bad workout video. I hate to exercise but at this point in my life I really needed to do something to get in shape. I didint want the typical workout videos that are avilable on the market. My God! Who could keep up with those guys if the only exercise you get is lifting the remote control to the tv daily! I mean I get tired just walking up a flight of stairs of running after my 2 yr old. Housework was even exhausting for me. This video was easy to follow and it is the perfect start for anyone who wants to get in shape and/or loose some weight. I have only been at it for a few weeks now but I feel better already. I would recommend this to anyone who is a beginner at exercise and wants to get in shape.
2,Best Quality Treats!,My Dogs love thes treats!Excellent Training tool!They always come running for them!Buy in bulk and keep in the freezer!Even Picky dogs love them!!!
2,See you later.....,"Live in Florida and since I love the sun my husband bought me this lounger. Could not find a lounger that was comfortable until this one, I absolutely love it. I tell my husband on the weekend...see you later ..off to sleep. It was a little pricey but worth every penny."
2,A Review of A Boy at War by Steven,"This is a great and stunning book! It is about a high school age boy named Adam. Adam's dad is in the Navy in Hawaii. In the beginning of the book Adam doesn't have any friends because his family has to move a lot. Then he becomes friends with two boys, Davi and Martin.One day when Adam is fishing with Davi and Martin the Japanese attack Pearl Harbor and bomb American battleships. After that the Americans think of the Japanese as their enemy. Adam helps the wounded soldiers. He searchs for his father, a lieutenant in the Navy, because he saw the Arizona, his father's battleship, explode.In this book Adam has to grow up very quickly. During this one horrible day he has to do a lot of adult things including driving a jeep to help find his father. Does Adam's dad survive? Is Adam going to be okay after being injured? Will Adam and his sister Bea ever see their dad again?"
2,Well worth reading!,"I rated this book as less than the best because (1) I prefer those rare books that invite the reader to think along with and argue with the author and (2) because I thought that he gave in to the beginner's inclination to kill off an attractive character just for dramatic effect. What I liked best about the book isn't often mentioned - his powerful evocation of scenes. His descriptions of the violinist and banjoist were beautiful; I didn't need a movie to ""see"" or ""hear"" the musicians. I also appreciated his mostly subtle descriptions of attraction to Ada - I don't need a graphic description of a roll in the hay. Some of the younger reviewers apparently can't place themselves in the era that this book represents. He also made frequent reference to one of my favoite books - Bartram's Travels. His descriptions of flora and fauna were, again, evocative of Bartram.I would recommend this book to any reader who is beyond the gothic and romance novel stage."
2,Pregnancy Yoga,I like the different lengths of yoga time. The video is great for stretching movies throughout pregnancy.
2,Sting is a gifted poet,Sting has done it again. He has moved me in such a way! The song I hung my head is so descriptive that you visulaize it and feel for him. Sting has an amazing gift to us all. He is a very gifted poet.
2,Its a nice book,"You need to know the proper names of G-d to use, the book does not provide you with the correct spelling. So if you already have this information, its a nice book."
2,A Well Loved Childhood Show,Peanuts Collection is a well loved childhood show for me. I use to stay up all night and watch all of the holiday shows from peanuts. The Christmas one is my favorite just because Christmas is my favorite holiday. Children of all ages I think will like it. Who doesn't like Charlie Brown?
2,Ninja Scroll,"I am an anime fan and I must say that I enjoyed Ninja Scroll immensely. I had this anime on VHS for years and recently began upgrading my anime to DVD. In my opinion, this item is a staple in any anime collection!"
2,Buenisimo!!!,"Me encanta este libro. Mi hija de apenas 10 semanas se lo disfruta muchisimo. Las imagenes y las diferentes tonalidades de colores en cada pagina son perfectos para el aprendizaje por asociacion ya que te da la oportunidad de poderles inventar historias. Ademas es buenisimo para los pequeÃ±itos pq pueden ejercitar los musculos de la vista, ademas que es una manera muy bonita de comenzar a introducirle los colores y de una vez ampliar su vocabulario de manera bilingÃ¼e."
2,A Great Wall Of Sound!,"DARK MATTER was my first introduction to the band IQ. I had heard an mp3 sample of the tune Sacred Sound and I was hooked. That song alone is worth the price of admission. Sacred Sound is very reminiscent of the classic Genesis lineup and does remind one of the tune Watcher Of The Sky. Other great tunes on this CD are Born Brilliant and Red Dust Shadow. I have heard some criticism of the lyrics on this CD being anti-American and I suppose they are, but I can tolerate such things if there is a point to it, and the music is good. This CD is great. Finally, some folks do not care for the vocals of singer Peter Nicholls, and that might just be personal taste, but the perfect keyboard work of Martin Orford more than makes up for any vocal shortfalls. This is just a great band. This one is definitely a buy for all fans of progressive rock and those who pine for the classic days of full sound bands like Procol Harum, Genesis, and YES."
2,"|A Good Movie but, too short","Harry Potter & the order of the phoenix is a good movie however, It's much shorter than all the others. The book also had a lot more in it. I know that the books are usually better than the movies anyway. They should have kept in a lot more of the story line than they did. If your a die hard fan of Harry Potter then you will enjoy it no matter what. It has a lot of adventure in it. But there is something missing in this latest installment of the Harry Potter movies. I did enjoy it but, I think the others are much better."
2,Will this play on a BluRay player in Australia?,"I doubt we'll get this for a LOOOOONG time, so I'm anxious to buy it as soon as it's available.Any idea if it will work over seasons?I have bought DVDs from Amazon and they work fine, because my DVD player was not region coded. Not sure about my BluRay player.Thanking you"
2,Another Heinlein Masterpiece,"I found this book in the personal library of a friend, and nearly had to be restrained from releasing my excitement at finding another Heinlein book. I have read all of his writing I could find! As the two main characters find themselves thrown about in the universe, or, more seemingly the universes around them, they realize the true weirdness of the cosmos, not to mention religion"
2,Just like Daddy's tools.,"I did a lot of research before buying my son this tool set for Christmas. After reading about some sets being flimsy, cheaply made, too small even for little hands or just blah we were anxious to get this set in the mail. After opening it up and letting our 1 year old play with it we were excited to say this set is great. It comes in an nice suitcase kind of packaging, which most tidy moms can appreciate, and my son loves it. Everything is durable and realistic looking, not like the some sets that the tools looks like characters from kid show. It also has the coolest drill ever... it spins two ways and the bit is removable. We had to put away some pieces because they are just too small for our 1 year old... but the packaging states its for kids over three. But our one year old loves it and carries the saw around with him everywhere."
2,Nikon SB-600 Speedlight Flash,"I am amazed how much difference there is in flash photos taken with the Nikon SB-600 compared to built-in flash on my Nikon D90. I wish I had gotten it much earlier. Highly recommend it if you anticipate taking many indoor photos or outdoor photos where ""fill-in"" flash would be helpful."
2,great,Works on the 1st week. My wife and me are really happy. I notice the results inmediately. Amazing product. I truly recomend this product.
2,"Outstanding Stand, Any way you look at it","I've own this stand for 2 years now, and I cannot stop recommending it. once again, its very sturdy, it looks professional, and although weight and portability are somewhat compromised, the overall performance is outstanding. Mine has gone through several hardships, being lost and dusted away, and being mistreated, dropped, and the normal grit of everyday use, and is still in excellent condition. apart from holding music, this stand, when horizontally set. is sturdy enough to hold a laptop computer and, since its adjustable, i've often used it in presentations when standing up, or sitting down. I personally thing it is a must for anyone with serious, or otherwise, musical intentions"
2,Not the strongest entry in the series,"The illstrations, while vivid, are a bit obtuse and difficult to discern. The prose doesn't flow. The book simply can't stand alone the way the ""counting Book"" and Miss Spider's Mom, do. If your child is hooked on Miss Spider, then this will be a fun addition to your collection, but it shouldn't be your first choice."
2,This naval will give you a reason not to giveup,"this book is amazing!!! read this book, its awsome!!this book is about a girl that has some family problems and thinks that the solution is to take it out on herself!! so she becom's anorexic!! OMG!! This is not the best way to go but at the end of all the hard work taht she had put up with at the rehad center for people with eating disorders, she got through it with a little help from her new friend Lilly. then she realizes that hating her parents was not the anger she had to express. READ THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!!:):):)"
2,"Finally! Thank you, Mr. Perry","I have been anxiously awaiting Eye of the Hunter. I have had a schoolgirl crush on Brendan Perry's rich, silky voice for many, many years (I think I was a schoolgirl before Mr. Perry was born!) He definately borrows his stylings from the crooners of yesteryear, which adds a sense of urbane class to his simple, lovely compositions.This new CD is lush and lovely, but it suffers a little from the overuse of the reverb. Perry's voice is strong enough to stand on it's own, and the recording sounds as if it were made in an echo chamber. I have heard this effect used with much success to hide the sins of lesser voices, and it just isn't needed here. Because of this, my old ears have a hard time making out the lyrics."
2,"No scam, really works","I never wrote a review before this one, bc j never was motivated to do so, but for this product, it definitely needed a review...You MUST FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS !I'm African, as black as it gets, and I use this product . I'm on my third month now and what I can tell you so far, is that my hair is definitely growing more faster than ever, I wash my hair way more often because it's more oily which I hope means my hair is getting more moisture which is needed for the hair growth (just as vivicscal promised) I'm honestly a customer just trying to spread the word...BUY IT, it really works !"
2,Great read aloud,"I love reading this to my three year old daughter. ""Chysanthemum, Chysanthemum, Chysanthemum..."" It's a charming story with emphasis on the strong bond between parents and children."
2,grat gift,"This shirt is well made and brought smiles to a friend who was undergoing chemo. The doctors told her to stay out of direct sunlight, the shirt was a funny reminder to help her comply"
2,Awecome carpet cleaner,"This carpet cleaner is worth every penny. It cleans extremely well - even completely removing pet stains/odors with the correct type of cleaning solution. It is light weight, easy to maneuver and leaves the carpets feeling only slightly wet!~ They dry in 1/2 the normal time."
2,A Real Cute Book!,"A perfect choice for a bedtime story! I am looking forward to seeing more African-American children's books like these. Young children will love it if you imitate the animal sounds while reading. Sweet, adorable illustrations add the perfect touch! Cherlina Works - author of Jewel's Magical Christmas."
2,The best,I purchased this for rolling thunder but got even more games I totally had forgotten about this is a must have for any old school gamer!
2,A Great book to haveI,This book is fun to read.There is a lot of informationnot found in other books.Holds your intrest.
2,christmas fun,I got this book from the library and I just don't want to return it! It is dissapointing that it is no longer being printed. The designs are beautiful with a great variety to suit everyone. That's great if you are like me and only do cross-stitch for other people!
2,You've heard it before but...,"It gives a gracious nod to their influences: New Order, etc, possibly Superchunk. Anyway, I'm always baffled by people making the complaint that a band's influences are obvious. Music lovers know the difference between a bad rip-off and an appreciative nod. Nobody's doing anything new under the sun. This album is great for shaking off a bad day by shaking your hips instead. This entire album is a good listen. It's fun, moody, nostalgic...great for driving or for dancing by yourself. Plus, that cover is captivating."
2,A VERY USEFUL BOOK.,"I am not a great fan of Reader's Digest (a personal thing), but I do feel they have a very good product with this book. I have had it for a number of years and there have been very few times that, when I had a question concerning house plants, this work could not provide the answer. Like anything else, this work in not by any means all inclusive, but it is quite a valuable resource when used with some of the other excellent books addressing this subject on the market. Information here is concise. The illustrations are quite good and the book is easy to use. This is certainly one you will want to add to your gardening library."
2,Not for the faint of heart but worth the scare,An unlikely combination of 1960's KASENETZ&KATZ bubblegum and Bardo Pond sonicsludge that is as goofy as it is appealing. If you are looking deep space trip out drones don't look here! This a album of 60s bubblepop hooks amplified through a wall of fuzztones. A very intregueing album if dissapointing that doesn't show the bands prowness in intestellar space jamming.
2,The Best Platform Ever!,"The GameCube is the ultimate video game platform ever created.It architecture is perfect and created specialy for the video game market in mine. It's small, confortable, fun... With Mario, Zelda, Metroid and all the bunch of characters, the gamecube will lead the next generation of platform."
2,Time for a replacement,"Well our first weather station is still working. The remote outdoor sensor just died after 4 plus years of working. Maybe we just got lucky after reading other reviews. Something that sticks in my mind though is, I think it is important to protect your sensor from the elements. Either find a well protected overhang on your house or hidden area out of the elements of rain and snow. You are also not to hang it in direct sunlight for obvious false temperature reasons. Another thing is screw the unit down. My father-in-law went the easy way using the adhesive tape. Sounds great but it doesn't work. It fell a few months later and broke of course. Hope the new sensor works just as long."
2,Excellent Service,First dvd arrived damaged ... appeared to be flaw in production. Contacted vendor ... sent replacement. All good. Excellent Service. No Hassles.
2,A rare 5 star book,"Excellent, excellent is the best I can say. For the Time Being starts out like a light-hearted comedic romp. Fun, but nothing to remember. It wasn't long before I began to realize there was a lot more to this book. The humor had me laughing in spots throughout but drama, action, and suspense soon began to come on strong.This was a ""can't put down"" book. I found myself flipping the book over frequently to get a look at the woman who could write such a surprising novel. Hmmm, I wonder if she's available... :-) She must have a really fun personality.I couldn't find anything else by Marie Desjardin. I wonder if this is her first book? If so, I look forward to reading her next."
2,Must have been the other book,"""How could Linus Pauling have endorsed this book, published in 1999, when Pauling died in 1994?""Surely it was BEATING CANCER WITH NUTRITION that was endorsed by Pauling."
2,READ IT IN ONE DAY,"Carolyn Haines can write! I loved the characters and the story was part charming, part thrilling. I couldn't put it down."
2,One of the Best Armstrong Discs.,"Yeah, this is surely one of the best Armstrong discs I've heard. It features some of the great standards, and Armstrong sounds great on vocals and trumpet. The first four tracks alone are worth admission with a reconstituted ""Hot Seven"" band (not the originals from the '20s). Favorites include, ""Sugar,"" ""Do You Know What It Means to Miss New Orleans?"" ""Black and Blue""--the latter recorded on V-Disc made for the G.I.s in WWII. V-Discs, of course, are prized for their quality and extended playing time (5-6 mins.) Other V-Disc tracks on this disc include, ""Old Rockin' Chair,"" and another version of ""Miss NO?"" with Lady Day. This is an excellent disc, and would make a good gift or addition to one's collenction."
2,A Great Read,"I have been a huge Robert Jordan fan since the beginning of the Wheel of Time books. I can't say enough about how much I have enjoyed reading and now re-reading this series. I'm very saddened that we lost Mr. Jordan. His genius will be sorely missed. Keep reading the series, my friends, it's worth it!!!Book 6 is the first ebook version of the series I have read. I'm not real happy with the Kindle version of this book however. There are a HUGE number of typos and punctuation errors in it. I compared ebook six to the hardback book and the typos are not in the hardback version. Very poor proofreading there. Oh well, everyone makes mistakes. Hopefully, this will not be the trend."
2,One above me is bull ----,"Sorry dude, but Finger Eleven is a TON better now then they were in the monkey age. There music style didnt change to much, but they definetly did not take a wrong turn there. Both Finger Eleven, TIP, and this CD are of the best i have ever heard in my music listening life."
2,"Cyndi Lauper, and her 1980's wardrobe are just plain fun to watch !","You are just not likely to see another movie with lamas, Cyndi Lauper, and a psychic quest in South America anytime soon. If you like quirky movie's like Xanadu and High Spirits, this movie will probably appeal to you.The DVD version although somewhat grainy is an improvement over the VHS version, and has no black borders to distract you from the picture. There are no extras to speak of on the DVD, but there is a cameo by Steve Buscemi in one of his earliest uncredited works.The movie, as expected, never got good reviews by the critics at large, and never broke 2 million in sales at the box office, but for the fans of Jeff Goldblum, Peter Falk, and Cyndi Lauper, this is some of the best comedy work they ever did. The movie is just plain fun to watch again and again."
2,"Fascinating real-life mystery, solved",If you're interested in literary mysteries - a real-life scholastic conundrum - this is the book for you. I was fascinated.
2,Little Signer,I started this video to wind down our day before bed time with my 11 month old. I must say from her reactions she loves the singing and in a months time has picked up how to sign dog and milk. Everytime she hears the music for the Diaper Dace she starts bopping. A great way to spend quaility time with your little one and for you both to learn something new.
2,AWESOME!,I love this how sooooooooooooooooo much. i wish they would make more of the series. Its a really good show and i would recommend to EVERYONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Watch it i promise u will b surprised!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,Inspiring Lessons for Leading a Great Life,"Mark has really compiled a great collection of some of life's greatest lessons. These are ""street"" learned lessons, not those taught in high schools and colleges. Once you have been out in the world for many years you will understand how truly important these lessons are to learn, retain and apply to everyday life. I am going to re-read the book, use it as a motivator and as a reference book. It covers such a wide variety of areas, virtually everyone can use it to get an objective, wise opinion on situations in life you are faced with. It has lasting value well beyond the initial read."
2,Grabbing Words for Spiritual People,"The powerful prose pushes the thoughts into the head. The stories are gripping, but every now and then, you must look around and make sure know one is seeing you read all those swear words. Check out the blog at [..]"
2,Great nostalgia kick,"I was a huge Atari fan back in the day, so I was very excited about this product when I saw it in stores. My wife took the hint and picked one up for me. What a great little product! I have had a great time getting into the old classics, and even my kids are enjoying it. ADVENTURE is especially good and is easily the game I play most. There is only one dark spot on this product - some of the games they chose for this joystick product were originally designed for the old paddle controller. Pong and Breakout just aren't the same."
2,Majestad is a classic!,"I love this stallion! In a collection of over 45 model horses, Majestad is my absolute favorite. The reason I give this model 4 stars for durability is not that he has broken in any way shape or form, it's that I have had multiple Breyers break their legs and go to the model horse heaven. Do not play with this too roughly, because that is why my other two broke. This stallion gives you a look of brilliance and kindness all mixed together. Overall, I think this stallion is the best and most beautiful horse Breyer ever made!!!!!"
2,Kim Williamson Breakaway Roping,"Helpful DVD, however the ""extra movie"" at the end was dumb.Would have liked more information on ropes, different styles, etc."
2,Best General Purpose Walk-Around Lens,"That big decision: The 24-70 (""The Brick"") or the newer 24-105 IS. I have researched for months and purchased both. The 24-105 is equal or better in everyway except moving objects in low light. The 10oz savings alone won me over. Purchase the 24-105 and then RENT the 24-70. You then will confirm you made the right choice. ""........ optical quality of the Canon L-Series Lenses and a widely used range of focal lengths, the Canon EF 24-105mm f/4 L IS USM Lens is one of the best and most popular Canon general purpose lenses made. The Canon EF 24-105mm f/4 L IS USM Lens quickly became one of my favorites. If I had only one lens, this would be the one."" The-Digital-Picture-Review.com"
2,Paul McCartney is a musical genius,"Ecce Cor Meum is the most beautiful piece of music I've heard. I get chills listening to it, over and over again. Sir Paul McCartney must be a beautiful person to have written so many wonderful pieces. I think this is his best. I believe Sir Paul McCartney has established his name in time: his music will be listened to and played for centuries to come."
2,Good as new,This DVD was like new I would order from them again. I really like this movie. It's good quality with no screeches.
2,When regular people need to understand complex problems...,"Ultimately a hopeful book, When Good Companies Do Bad Things attacks the concept of corporations as monoliths. Instead, through examples, anecdotes and analysis, we see that global business corporations are more human than we think, for better and worse, and subject to change---if they [and we] choose it-- for the better. I found my questions addressed as they arose from the reading; the balanced perspective [neither ""anti"" nor ""pro-business""]offers a real opportunity to understand a complex social issue."
2,I Have a Question,I want to improve the sound from my iPod touch 4th gen coming out from my AudysseyiPod portable speaker system (more bass tones) & large Sony iPod boom box. The Audyssey has a 3.5mm line in & the Sony has standard RCA (standard red & white) line in plugs. Would this DAC plugging the ipod into the USB input with 3.5mm or RCA line outs to the players work to improve the sound quality of the iPod ??
2,Taxi Driver,An absolutely excellent film and a tribute to both De Niro and Scorsese. A must for every DVD collection.
2,Flashback...,"Crazy, old school answer to the sex pistol bridge. Can you say Miami Vice? Six more words required for submission..."
2,"Wonderful light, found again!","I used these before and was thrilled that the company still makes them. My old ones were purple, and they no longer make them in that color, but I was so thrilled to find these again, I ordered 5 of them and can't wait til I get them! Now I know where to find them if I need more. They make great gifts, too! I gave one to a friend on her way to college, and she loves it! The clip is so much sturdier than the clip of other kinds of book-lights."
2,The Sountrack for a Life,"I first heard this upon its first release, playing in a local restaurant in Boston, and I knew it was a must-own. The first CD has been blowing me away from Day 1; the second remix set took me longer to warm up to, and now they are practically equal, each with its own mood.This music is mesmerizing as one cruises down the highway on long roadtrips, and perfect for a night of sustained lovemaking. It really augments whatever pleasure one is pursuing in life, and creates a lot of pleasure in its own right for any occasion.It is beyond any rating system."
2,A perfectly crafted gem.,"Deep soul doesn't get better - simple as that. The songs are perfect: Pat Robinson & Rocky Burnette's You Got Away With Love, Carla Olson's Why Did You Stop, the Mikael Rickfors title track... and the covers (!): I Wish It Would Rain, Your Love Will Save The World (Bee Gees) and a masterful take on I've Got Dreams To Remember featuring Steve Cropper. It's all so very good. (Bobby Womack and Mick Taylor also appear as do the Waters on backup vocals.)"
2,GO KNOW RUN AND GET THIS CD,MARY HAS BROKE THROUGH EVERY MJB FAN NEEDS TO HAVE THIS ONE AND IF YOU DON'T YOUR NOT A TRUE FAN. MARY IS REALLY HOLDING IT DOWN FOR ALL THE TRUE R& B HEADS OUT THERE THANK YOU MARY YOU DID IT AGAIN
2,Leave a tip!,"It's nice to reflect on a sad time and something good come of it. As a young man, I remember feeling down when I learned of ""Pigpen's"" death, having just seen him and the Dead in concert the year before. I purchased this album on vinyl when released and was picked up as it were, by the new and improved sound of the Grateful Dead, so much so I went back and bought ""Wake of the Flood"". Great service and a great experience, thanks!"
2,Great multi-functional alarm clock,Works great. Love the CD and .mp3 option. I had to put the light on the lowest setting since the higher settings were too bright for night. I wish that the dimmer was intuitive enough to be brighter when I turned on the light so I can see it.
2,Worked great for our odd mailbox.,"My wife bought a large mailbox but we lost the paperwork to order the proper stand. After trying several alternatives from the hardware store, I found this online and it worked great. The metal is easily bendable to suit your needs."
2,good price,I bought it for my kid to use after school study. Hope he uses it to improve his word power.
2,None Better,"This is the last jigsaw you will ever buy, unless you buy loaners for your neighbors and kids. CPO sells a minty refurb for @ $20 less but then adds shipping, and doesn't offer Amazon's standard $25 off of any major tool purchase. Your choice. A buck is a buck, and CPO is good.This saw cuts straight and does curves and tight spots extremely well. I am a beginner woodworker but I have tried and owned a couple of other jigsaws that just can't compare. Yes, it's heavier than my old jigsaw, but I don't cut so much that the weight is an issue, and the stability and power more than make up for a little added weight. Forget the price. Tomorrow you won't miss the money and you'll have a jigsaw that will last a lifetime.Buy Bosch Progressor blades and don't look back. They are equal to the saw's ability and then some. More than worth the slight extra money. Don't forget to buy a few special-purpose blades, too. And buy more clamps!Bosch has really figured out the jigsaw and its blades."
2,Awesome,"Roses are Red is a great read. The opening with the book robbery is brilliant. Mastermind is the perfect villian I think. Intelligent,ruthless, and very patient.He is just too cool.Patterson's book are impossible to put down. One of my favorites in the series."
2,Keeps you going!!,"The chai tea bars are my favorite. The coating on the top is a mix of creamy topping with cinnamon and ginger, but not overpowering. I used to be starving a couple hours after breakfast, hours before lunch....one of these at 10 o'clock sees me through even past my normal lunch time.It's packed with calcium and other goodness women (and men) need. If you're expecting some gooey mess you'll be disappointed, but if you're looking for some tasty nutrition, this is it."
2,Good Turkey Fryer,I received this after thanksgiving so I had to bake my turkey. But over Thanksgiving weekend we had a lot of expected company and others stayed over. We used this to fry a turkey on Saturday and this works real well.Great product and a great price.
2,Cast Iron Pots,"Purchased Lodge 12 Inch Skillet and Cover. Used to make Pommes Anna recipe. Though it cooked well had to put the final product under the broiler after removing and inverting from the skillet to brown the ""top"". Perhaps I used too much butter?The combined weight of the skillet and top, especially when removing from the oven after cooking an hour at 400 degrees is a daunting task,and I am close to 300 lbs."
2,Technology as religion,"Both religion and technology are seductive in their ability to both soothe and explain - but both are dangerous in the hands of zealots of either discipline. Stern, a Harvard professor and former fellow on terrorism at the Council on Foreign Relations, expands her definition of religious terrorists worldwide by including the Muslim jihad in Indonesia, militant Palestinians, zealous Israelis, and Americans who kill abortion doctors in the name of Christianity. Stern outlines how militants of all persuasions find recruits and recondition them in cultlike sects to embrace suicide and murder.Stern spent 5+ years traveling worldwide to research this book, which combines psychology and forensic science in a remarkable study that all who are interested in keeping abreast of the growing role of religious terrorism should be required to read."
2,A must read for anyone looking for an understanding of the Christian faith!,"The clearest, most systematic and logical study of Romans chapters 1-8. Answers that address the delimmas in today's world. A must read for anyone looking for an understanding of the Christian faith."
2,tamper,"terrys tamper works a lot better than the one that comes attached to most units ,looks and works great! price was ok too."
2,Mustang Car Cover,"I bought this cover for my 2006 Mustang Convertible.My Husband and myself put it on without any problem.It can easely be put on by one person, At this timeso far there are no complaints. We just hadsix inches of snow so we will see how well it held upSo Far So Good. I would reccomend this product toany one. THE PRICE IS RIGHT. AMAZON IS MY FAVORITESHOPPING SPOT, I ALWAYS LOOK HERE FOR MOST OF MYAPPLIANCES, HOME FURNISHING ETC."
2,Lots of sex,If you want a bonk fest this is definitely the right book loads of sex and the story is ok too completely unrealistic but we can all dream about a sexy stranger having his wicked way with us....!
2,comet watching,"I'm in complete agreement with most of the other reviewers. Please release this movie soooooooonnnnn on DVD! I have fond memories of this movie, and the soundtrack,""which I don't think was ever released"". Hey maybe that can be an extra bonus, releasing the soundtrack with the DVD as well! To all fans awaiting this movies' release on DVD, I'm right there with you. Let's keep our fingers crossed for this one!M. Eucalyptus B."
2,Great for a garden themed bedroom,"We ordered this picket fence to use in our daughter's butterfly garden themed bedroom. We used the picket fence along one wall above the baseboards and added some silk gerber daisies. It looks so adorable. After considering our options for a picket fence in her bedroom, this was the best choice. It's scale to the room was appropriate and it's safe (no spliters or sharp edges). We screwed it into the wall and used white plastic screw covers to finish it out. It arrived in excellent condition and in relatively no time. Great product and great service."
2,Pretty good,"I bought this to hopefully help with all the dust in my smaller house. Judging by the dust it collects, it does indeed work well. I usually leave it on the lowest setting so the noise it makes is not an issue at all for me. I enjoy having the noise at night anyway. Cranked up on the highest setting will be louder, but you should know that already. My only fault with it is that when it rotates it screeches like someone scraping their nails on a chalkboard. Therefore, I never leave it in rotate mode. Cleaning the filters is easy and you just have to let them dry before using again. Overall a good product."
2,I Couldn't Put It Down !,"I thought this was a great book and I couldn't put it down!A great historical novel with realistic descriptions of the pilots, planes, and airfields. I felt like I was there. The characters and plot were interesting as well. I recommend it highly for everyone."
2,Tim Burton's classic cult movie,"I finally found this movie to purchase on e-bay and have enjoyed watching it ever since. I had to avoid the ""DVD scalpers"" on this website and I was very glad that I did. This movie is a ""stand alone"" classic that has turned into a cult movie for some cultures. The story is wonderful and the animation is even greater. This movie is also great for watching from Halloween to Christmas and beyond. If you can't purchase it, rent it. It is well worth the owning."
2,A Strange Diorama....,"Starting with the intriguing title & cover image, followed by the stunning interior photos of stuffed creatures in nature dioramas, and rounded out by the static stones of sampling flowed over by the elastic voice of Bristol diva Sian Evans, Kosheen is an aural & visual experience not to be missed.The melancholy of ""Let Go"" and the snarkiness of ""Cruelty"" transcend all music label genres of drum & bass, electronica, and intelligent pop. It is the melodies that rule here, not the protools.If you like Dido, Slowpho, Olive and especially Beth Gibbon's of Portishead's solo CD, ""Out of Season,"" then you will love Kosheen."
2,Buy this book now!,"I have read many books on parenting - everything from BabyWise on up. There is NO book better than this. The wisdom is so true and so simple, yet mostly things we just don't think of day in and day out. This book has literally changed our lives and I've now seen it change the lives of others who have read it. Stop reading my words and just go buy this book - you will not regret it."
2,Good Pita Chips,"These pita chips were good. I'm not that fond of pita chips but love anything that is pesto & sundried tomato. They weren't tasty enough for me. If you're a chip lover, this is not for you.The thing about buying food over Amazon is that the expiration date is only like 2 months away. Plan to split the food and costs with someone, it'll help. Or put it in the break room for your coworkers, that's what I do."
2,Bell better fit for me,"I bought this after talking to a local bike shop. I was really interested in a Giro Helmet as I heard good reviews about them. I went in and the mechanic at the bike shop that bell and Giro are the same company. There helmets are basically the same, with one difference. The bell has a more rounded feel, so if you are like me with a more round head it fits perfectly. I tried the Giro and found a lot of pressure on the front and rear of my head. With the bell I didn't have that pressure. It's a great inexpensive helmet. that has enough vents to keep my head cool."
2,My current favorite CD,I've been hitting the repeat button on this CD since I've gotten it. Two legends for the price of one!
2,"Dracula, staring Frank Langella","This is by far in my opinion, the sexiest Dracula retelling on the market! Frank Langella just nails the role as the disturbingly hypnotic Count Dracula. He has fleshed out the character so well, that you actually root for him to escape with his new bride and let the villagers be damned.There is maybe just one scene where I think things were a bit campy (Dracula smashing a mirror in front of Van Helsing) but beyond that, an elegant telling of the tale. An excellent DVD to add to your collection of monster movie."
2,"Wit, Charm, and Guile","This is a penetrating story written gracefully and honestly by a courageous woman. Its compelling and essential messages are delivered with exquisite subtlety, so that our appreciation for the earth, for the people in our lives who lift us, for the waters that cleanse and renew us, and ultimately, for ourselves, is heightened and sharpened by each flowing page. What's more, Hemingway's Southern wit, charm, and guile make this book a heck of a lot of fun to read."
2,this musical had it all,"Hello i just saw this musical this weekend and it was one of the best musical i ever saw. it had everything: good singing, good acting and the comedy was even good. so now i'm gonna buy the cd. So when your in nyc and you have a musical on your mind go see the scarlet pipernel and as the commercial says ""bring your mother""."
2,Talking to Heaven is amazing,I have been searching for something to help answer my questions since my dog departed this earth and after reading about the first 5 pages of Talking to Heaven I couldn't believe what I was reading. This book answered so many of my spiritual questions very quickly and it was hard to put the book down. Written by a man raised as a strict Catholic I too was raised with a strict religious background and had many questions I was not to ask or if I did would not be answered. The author of this book seems to understand the human piece of loss and grief and I cannot tell you how much I appreciated his knowledge and relief! Excellent book and easy to read.
2,prophetic rock,"Reviwers here primarily are evaluating the musicianship and emotional mood that the music creates, which of course is penetrating and great.The most important theme though I believe to be the lyrics.Written by Peter Sinfield in 1969, it gives a fine sense of where the world is headed, the musical equivalent to George Orwell's 1984.Substitue Rothschild for the Crimson King, and you have an allegoricalscenario similar to the Mozart's Magic Flute where freemasonry was exposed.The fire witch was left standing in Dresden on Ash Wednesday during the firebombing of February 14, 1945 when several hundred thousand people perished.With Epitaph the plot and mammon's destiny are unveiled, with the prayer of hope left hanging by a thin thread ... are we there today ?"
2,Delicious,Great taste for those who need a sugar-free product. Excellent packaging keeps these cookies fresh and crispy.
2,Great way to spend your time.,"This little book is a great way to spend your time in a world where there are so many things that are not. I carry it in the car so when I have to go in to a business where I know I will have to wait, I can take it along. The positive thoughts and quiet acts of God's eyes, hands and feet in the world will warm your heart."
2,Nice home machine,For a home leg machine it has good features and design. Weight can be selected / changed in workout position. The canted bench is good for relieving back stress. I has an embrodered logo in the upper bench pad which adds a bit of class. Hand grips are in a good position for both prone and upright positions. It is easy to take apart to move as I have done this a few times. I bought this machine in March of 2005. Amazon just sent me a review request Oct 2012.
2,EXCELLENT READ,"At first, I thought this was going to be another version of The Maze Runner series or even Hunger Games. Post apocalyptic ""event"" world with children bearing the brunt of the fall-out. I should state for the record I loved both those series.I was delighted to find in this book Card takes that same concept but refines it for an older audience and literally and figuratively takes it in a different direction. EXCELLENT book and could not put it down!"
2,Readable,"This focused discussion of several questions about Judaism and how it differs from other religions is an excellent argument for Judaism. Brief, focused, but conversational in tone, it was very educational for me."
2,"""Credible Journey""",Mr. Rowland makes the journey of this intelligent dog working her way to the top of a prestigious government language school in the Monterey area surprisingly credible. Read it. And enjoy it. I did.
2,Please release this in a widescreen version!,"Even though I was a criminal defense lawyer at the outset of my career, I haven't much to add to the plaudits here, other than that it felt realistic to me.However, I did notice at the outset the standard ""pan and scan"" statement that the film had been reformatted to fit your screen - which means it was filmed in a widescreen format.Why hasn't this film been released in a widescreen version? It's one of the all time classic films - it deserves it. I'll also bet that with Duke Ellington providing the score, there must be a stereo master of the music available, so a stereo mix shouldn't be hard to create - voices and sound effects are not that hard to isolate and locate in a stereo or surround sound field."
2,Loony tunes by a schizoid,"I stayed awake for 24 hours to finish The Fountainhead and will agree - it's one of the most powerful novels written in the 20th century. (And I speak as an Oxford MA Hons in English Lit, if that's worth anything, which I doubt.)However, Rand was a deeply mixed up gal. She worships rapists. (*All* the heroes in her novels are rapists - look carefully!)She'd have swooned at Saddam Hussain's feet. (He is, after all, by her definitions a man of integrity, naked strength and moral courage - true to himself. Just as a hyena is true to itself.)Rand's favourite characters are, as has been said elsewhere, psychopaths.Her female protagonists in The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged are, frankly, insane. Just as, I suspect, Rand was.Look more closely at her 'philosophy', expressed in her non-fiction works, and it disintegrates into a babble of circular logic."
2,Landreth Live,"I have been a Sonny Landreth fan for years and I didn't realize he was in this group. I really enjoy this CD, good music, good music. Start with the first song, ""Up Tight Woman"" a little more rock based song and roll into a very slow version of ""T.V. Mama"" which is excellent. Landreth takes over for ""Illinois Blues"" featuring his guitar and Stanley Behrens on vocals and harmonica. You can see by the other reviews that the people that have this CD all give it higher ratings. Good Blues, great music and if you are a Landreth fan it is a must have."
2,brought back memories,Very interesting to me a I spent 6 months in a nearby town just 4 years after the war. The places and people were not much different from when the author was there.Will be recommending the book to my Tuscan friends.
2,Transition from 1980s to 1990s,"The KLF I first heard with a neighbor back in 1999. I wanted to hear some screaming music and my neighbor recommended this album. I love the songs ""What Time is Love?"" and ""3AM Eternal."" Some of the songs sound techno and other just like 80s rock. A loud but great upbeat album."
2,If you are a fanatic or just a casual fan...,It has a little bit of everything for everyone. Martin does a great job mixing in old footage with more current interviews.Mr. Harrison is very much missed.
2,Works for me,"I have been using this flash drive for over a year now and have not had any problems with it that I can recall.With USB 2.0 you just plug it in and drag the files you want to store into the flash drive window, no installing software or drivers required. This flash drive supposedly works with USB 1.0 as well, but for that you have to first go to Kingston's website to download drivers.I like this flash drive because it's an easy way to store or transfer a small amount of data, it's cute and compact, and best of all.. it does not give me any trouble when I need it to work."
2,Storage Device for Digital Memory,"My wife and I travel frequently and we also shoot a lot of pictures in Nikon Raw file format. Because of the large file sizes, we need to carry several memory chips with us and these storage devices are perfect. They come with a clip and chain which makes it easy to clip the device on a camera bag or a belt loop. I would recommend these to anyone who travels with their camera gear."
2,Great book for those just starting out,"This book along with "" Water Dog"" will provide the beginnig trainer everything needed to have a good hunting dog for a finished product. If a person has just gotten a dog or is thinking of getting one it would be well worth the time to read these books. How ever don't get to flustered if your dog is not doing everything at the times Wolters has set. Every dog is different."
2,Great reading,"A great story about a great man, well, just a boy really. I'm amazed how someone so young could train and fly a Spitfire in the Battle of Britain. His writings are well produced and not in the style of a hero. Just how these boys handled the stress is beyond me, many died and many, including the author, suffered mentally. Todays kids could do well to read this and see what is possible when one really works at it."
2,The best thriller of all-time!,Wow! I read this book in two hours I could not put it down! Usually I hate the thrillers because they never tie in with the real books but this one totally changed my opinion on that. DEFINITELY read this book and just a hint- the guy on the cover is NOT Sam!
2,Scansnap S510,I am amazed at how fast this scanner can scan both sides of a document at the same time. The software was easy to install and worked the first time. The interface is easy and straight forward. I can send multipage documents as PDF files in minutes instead of the hour it used to take.
2,MOST EXCELLENT.,"have always loved the girls but we can all admit...lately their music hasn't been great.well...that ended here. im a bartender and this album is PERFECT to play to get people in a feel good mood. cant say enough about the production values, the writing !?!?! is awesome, the vocals are tight, and overall a awesome, modern yet retro sound.every. single. song. is amazing and ridiculously catchy. i dont like 'waterfall' but i just skip it.This beats Madonna's Confessions....and i dont say that lightly or often...A true joy that im loving so much...get it."
2,A Great Story of Love,"This movie was bought on the recommendation of our pastor. It tells the story of Corrie Ten Boom during WWII when so many Jewish children were taken to the camps. She and her family and friends collected Jewish children, kept a record of where they were placed and kept them safe during the war.Ten Boom and her sister were both sent to the camps for what they did, while friends who helped were killed. Her sister died but Corrie lived and was alive when the video was made and actually spoke about what she did at the end.This is a story of true love; not in the romantic sense, although she did fall in love with a Jewish man and they married, but in the sense of risking her own life to save the lives of many children whose only ""crime"" was being born Jewish."
2,Webster's New Explorer Crossword Puzzle Dictionary,My only complaint is that the print is too small on Webster's New Explorer Crossword Puzzle Dictionary. Other than that I like it very much. William Harden
2,This Uglydoll was Cute!!,"Adorable, cushy doll! My granddaughter loved this gift. She dragged it everywhere. I noticed she even used it as a pillow in the car - very good for that since it is fairly flat."
2,No more mess,does exactly what its supposed and helps this messy baker keep things cleaner!you won't be sorry if you get this!
2,This is the best single CCIE volume ever.,"The CCIE is just like the Ph.D. program. You have to know the basics (Bachelors Degree), then you have to specialize (Masters Degree), and then you have to research using multiple sources to finally qualify and get your Ph.D. This book will equip CCIE candidates to be able to qualify into the CCIE program.Like in the Ph.D. you cannot read a book to qualify let a lone pass the dissertation defense.In the CCIE program you have to know the stuff, have the ability to research, pass the qualification test, and finally be able to defend you knowledge in the CCIE Lab.If you ask most CCIEs today, they will tell you that the Giles book is in their reference library, and that they sue it alot. Wonderful book for use to get your low-end Cisco Certifications(CCNA,CCNP) and to get your Cisco Doctorate, CCIE."
2,"Great, But Made To Sound Like Sea Interludes From Britten's Peter Grimes","Barbirolli has always been a quizzical conductor to my ears. At least he seemed always to try to make something of the music he performed, which is my highest desideratum in readings. But his approach always seemed to emphasize the potential sound -effects in music. He seemed little interested in conveying the basic structure of the music, which to me seems to hold the most possibility for drama and beauty in great works. But, again, at least he tried to do something. Well, here is a performance where his approach seems to have hit a golden mean, and is spectacular. Oddly, his sound- effects approach is even more present than usual. But somehow it brings out the contours of this work in a very uncanny fashion. At the same time the music takes on a slightly altered character, as if it were a companion piece to the Sea Interludes from Peter Grimes by Britten. But who cares, it works."
2,A kids' classic for adults,"I love the vintage feel of this story. It's very similar to my favorite Bradbury book,Dandelion Wine. His use of language is intoxicating, and this short novella is no exception. This story was written for elementary readers, but I'm not sure that children will appreciate the beauty of the writing. I would describe the story as a Halloween version ofA Christmas Carol. There are not exact parallels, but it has that kind of feel. In trying to help their dear friend Pipken, eight boys travel through history with the mysterious Mr. Carapace Clavicle Moundshroud to try to rescue him. Along the way, the boys learn how other cultures have contributed to what has become known to us as Halloween."
2,A literary gem,"This timely collection brings together the body of work of arguably one of the important European practitioners of verse Ireland has issued forth. Urbane, deeply insightful, humourous and humane, Cronin's poetic offering is work of the highest artisitc altitude"
2,One of the Most Interesting and Valuable Reference Works on Freemasonry,"Very useful, but, as all such Victorian-era works, the contents reflect the idiosyncratic interpretations of the compiler. Still, it contains many entries which are merely factual, such as biographical, historical, literary, etc.; a wealth of data."
2,Christe Little,"Death on the Nile was not Christe's finest work, or her most well crafted. The murder itself was wonderfully done, but the method in which the aforesaid murder was rather unlikely. The engineering of such a plan as the murder(s) carried out was not something a normal person, or, for that matter, most any person would be able to do effectively. Few, if any, human beings would have the mental stamina necessary to carry out murders. Several things were done by the murderer(s) that normal human beings are simply not capable of. I cannot give examples here without breaking to the reader the end of the novel, but I will say that such events as take place in the novel are hardly likely in the real world."
2,"Great Fan, great value","I typically don't write many reviews, but I like Amazon. We are very happy with this fan. Last spring I bought a couple Hampton Bay 52"" fans and they are great. This fan is very attractive, and the best part is that it very, very quiet. We got it for our new bedroom we built. My biggest concern was noise. If I hear a fan making constant humm on low, I would never sleep. We are very happy so far. It has been up and used regularly for nearly a month. Cons: the pulls for the light and fan (separate) are kinda cheap looking (picture of a fan and light respectively). I had read a review prior to my purchase that the fan ""rocks"" too much when you pull a chain. This just isn't the case with ours. It sounds like their fan may not be properly seated in the hanging bracket. I would highly recommend this fan."
2,A good follow-up of Love To Love You Baby!,"Her 2nd domestic release- not a bad one either, though it dosen't have the brilliant album concept like 'Four Seasons of Love' does. What is the meaning of Love Trilogy and how do these tracks apply to the theme?? Who knows. Still, a fabulous set of tunes, all very disco-oriented. The best of course being Try Me, I Know We Can Make It...an 18-minute ORIGINAL masterpiece that has been shortened to 3-4 minutes on succeeding releases. In second comes Could It Be Magic (both the prelude and main song.) The other two tracks Wasted and Come With Me are passable bonuses to the album. Excellent for Donna Summer and disco fans."
2,"I haven't read the DaVinci Code yet, but I will after this","I would highly recommend this suspenseful read.....though not if you have a queasy stomach (some scenes are pretty graphic). I picked this up at the airport, expecting the usual fluff, and I was more than pleasantly surprised. I literally could not put it down! With twists from beginning to end, this book incorporates a traditional murder mystery with a fascinating exploration of terrorism, human nature, and the complexities of modern religion. If you're an art history buff, the main character's pursuit of evil based on clues left by Bernini is an added bonus."
2,Knitting in the Round,Nice book with a number of patterns but still lacking in good instruction on knitting socks with circular needles.
2,Astounding quality!,"Its amazing how much two actors can sound like two real people. Witherspoon and Phoenix (I'm not sure how to spell it...) do an awesome job of singing these songs. They put a lot of effort into making the movie itself, but the actual singing took way more effort. Both of them went to music school for multiple months to make sure their parts are to the dollar. Witherspoon actually looked through June Carter's closet to make sure she knew what to wear! But thats just the movie. Seriously, this CD is amazing. One of the few soundtracks I listen to. An easy 5/5."
2,Enjoyable for Both Young and Mature Adults,"I think most readers will enjoy ""The Black West in Story and Song as much as I did, so I recommend it to curious young adults or interested and informed adults. Dr. Wise's complete review of this book will appear in the next issue of the Missouri Folklore Journal."
2,Fantastic,"I loved this cd, every time I listen to it I will be reminded of Jonathan Brandis. God rest his soul."
2,"Battlestar Galactica, Captivating is the Only Word to Describe","This isn't a big long review, because I don't do many. But this series is a must see, especially those who are Trekkies and Star Wars fans. I watched the entire series from day one 'with few eceptions' and I could not stand to hardly miss a new episode. The SciFi channel almost ruined it by their off again, on again presentation methods. but I prevailed. So watching from the beginning without all the breaks and commercials will be ""Great"". So I can hardly wait for it's release. For Blu-ray the price is not that bad, regular DVD would save us all a lot of $$$'s though. Whether you wait for a while OR buy it now is up to you and your budget. But you won't be disappointed whenever you do buy The Complete Series."
2,excellent introductory text on microwave engineering.,This text make you wish human clonation could be performed on mr Pozar to clarify many subjects in eletronics-electromagnetics.The author makes a very good job of explaning both the theory and the applications in the microwave engineering area.His explanations are very clear and he takes always the most straightforward path for reaching the final formula.Only (very relative) weakness is the lack of a satisfyng theory about microstrip impedance.I think this book is a must for any newcomer to the microwave field .5 stars!
2,Mixed feelings about this one... but it's still a keeper!,"I definitely have mixed feelings about this one... things are hit and miss for me with the tortured hero plot. I love Katherine Sutcliffe- her syle of writing, the types of characters she creates. She doesn't over simplify their emotions but she also doesn't spell out every detail of their pasts or futures. I feel like this one was a little too violent for me-- obviously characters don't have to love eachother to have sex, but anything resembling rape is biiig big turn off. Even if she means yes when she says ""no,"" it's still a NO. The fact that our main hero has committed acts of rape as part of native American raiding parties makes me sad for his character and a little disgusted. At the end of the story, I am happy for our couple and feel like they FIT eachother... but alluding to rape will always taint a story a little bit for me. Sutcliffe doesn't treat the subject cavalierly, but it still leaves a bad taste."
2,great for Spanish lit class,"This book is perfect for my 18th century Spanish literature class. All of the readings are in Spanish, but there are helpful English glosses. The readings are samples from neoclassicist writers with a uniquely Spanish flair on enlightenment."
2,Better Than Expected,"I ordered this bag because of the other positive reviews it's received. Having owned several camera bags over the years, this is my favorite."
2,This album rocks!,I bought this album many years ago on cassette and was very excited to see it available on CD. A must have for any true heavy metal fan. Flanged guitars and haunting lyrics...not a bad track on this album. Definitely worth buying!!!
2,Thank you Tsultrim Allione,"I am one of those who feel a hunger for echoes of the great women spiritual leaders of Buddhism. They are never mentioned in many tibetan centers.This book has been a real source of inspiration.Thank you Tsultrim Allione, I received from you some answers to my painful questions about sexism and prejudices against women in Buddhism."
2,Daugharty&#65533;s Finest Literary Work,"Meet Doll Baxter: a feisty, full of spunk, spirit, and charm, 17-year-old woman who sets out to save her family's farm and ends up with more than she bargained for. Doll, the title character of Janice Daugharty's latest novel, must deal with her new surroundings at Staten Plantation after she agrees to marry the dashing, daring, and most eligible bachelor Daniel Staten.The skillful Daugharty with her masterful paintbrush pen captures the essence of the rural South in this historical fiction set in South Georgia shortly after ""The War."" The novel captures with breathtaking vitality the young married life of Doll and Daniel Staten, all the while unraveling one of the finest Southern family sagas and creating stunning narrative voices. This novel is Daugharty's finest literary work and sure to be the first of a highly acclaimed trilogy."
2,a film about an Italian gang rivaling the mafia,"This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film.Gomorrah is a film about the real life Neapolitan organized crime organization, Camorra, which while unrelated to the mafia, shares some of their traits. The film shows the lives of several people who are affected by the group.The film is quite violent but not as much as many other films are. I found the film interesting as I never heard of the group depicted in the film. The supplements mention the group has rivaled the mafia in both membership and the number of people killed. The film is candid about their activities and the author of book the film is based on, Roberto Saviano, has been living under non-stop police protection.Supplements on Disc one are a theatrical trailer.Disc two has a documentary on the film's production, an interview with Roberto Saviano, interviews with selected cast and crew, and deleted scenes."
2,Rambler Knife Review,"Have owned this syle of knife for years. This is the smallest of the Victorinox knives, that I know of, that carry a phillips head screw driver on the end of the bottle opener. This along with the usual regular head, sissors, bottle opener, file, tweezers, toothpick and of course the knife blade make this a very handy small unobtrusive pocket companion. I would and do recommend this to anyone that carryies this type of tool.Amazon as always, was easy to order from as was their third party vendor. The items arrived quickly and as advertized."
2,Great book,"It is so disturbing that we don't learn from history and do the same mistakes again and again. It is a wonderful book that puts human faces to all the major American regime change operation in the past century. It is usually a handful of people and their ambitions which spark these events. Most of the time, the outcomes are not good for America and they were even worse for the people in the countries that had a regime change. And for the cases of especially Iran and (possibly) the current regime change in Iraq, the outcome is really bad for the entire world. It is a ""must read"" book."
2,Wonderful return from Curve,"A return after a 5 year absence sees no decrease in quality. It all starts off with the single 'Chinese Burn', a thunderous rhythm track, all beats and vitriolic lyrics. 'Coming Up Roses' is one of my favourite Curve tracks. Quite reserved in terms of noise, no wall of sound etc. It features textured electronic analogs along with a pounding drum loop.'Something Familiar' is a pure pop/rock track. Chiming guitars combine with more aggressive guitars to form a strong, powerful song. Other highlights include the fast paced 'Sweetback' and the albums' last track 'Recovery', which leaves us wanting more.An extremely underrated album mainly due to the fact that in 1998 the music world was disintegrating into the whole boy-band and girl-band hell it is now. Well it's their loss, Curve will always have a strong following no matter what because they are one of the few talented and genuine music groups out there."
2,Great Fireplace,I bought one of these bcause I was sick and tired of cleaning the ashes from the fireplace. My wife liked it so much that we bought a second one for the fireplace downstairs.
2,Pop Radio Strange Radio,"Strange Radio is a radio-friendly, female-fronted, edgy, Los Angeles-based pop/rock band with smooth ear-candy female vocals and licks/loops to groove by. The band wrote and produced ""Crazy Days"" for the Raleigh Studio's feature-length film ""Man Fast"", February, 2002. ""Walking In A Video"" was used in the trailer for ""It's a Guy Thing"" (w/Jason Lee, Julia Stiles, Selma Blair), March, 2003.

2,A fantastic first remote-control toy,"I bought this for my son's first birthday, and he absolutely loved it!The toy has two remote-control stages. In the first, the remote control sits on the toy. Your child can make the goofy giggles move around and giggle by pushing any of the three buttons. My son was able to figure this out very quickly and was so proud of himself for making the toy move. At this stage it moves in a random pattern and my little boy thought it was hysterical if the vehicle seemed to be coming toward him (or even better, the cat!).My son is now almost two and he uses the remote control separate from the car. He has had no problems using the buttons to control the vehicle.We also have several different flooring types in our home (carpeting, tile, and hardwood) and the toy moves from one to the other with ease."
2,I really liked them!!!!,"Everything was as I expected to be! the elastic waist band exactly the way i like, The assorted colors were ok, still do not know if the color will stay after being washed, but so far so good. Nothing to dislike, Will buy again when needed."
2,Ready to dance?,"OMG the cd is awesome !! Everybody should buy it ! This CD didn't have any promotion so let Britney know that we love her by buying her new CD ! And it's really worth it. It also have that new song And Then We Kiss which is awesome ! Trust me, you won't be disapointed ! Please buy it !"
2,Great Movie,Not sure what to put here... works as it should and have not had any issues with it so far.
2,Super Powers Cool,"I enjoy this dvd and would recommend it to fans of Super Heros cartoons. Fun to watch amd brings me memories of my childhood. I still watch cartoons at my age (56),and it is a great stress buster."
2,Hands down one of the best book ever!,"This is by far the best book ever. I have purchased more copies then I can count and I have given it to all of my family members and most of my friends. All of them loved it. Even my mother told me it was one of the best books she had ever read. Being she reads a book every two weeks that's a pretty good compliment.This is a short book, but it takes a long time to read. It's not that it's a hard read; it's just that it's so good you will take your time to read it. Almost like savoring a great wine.I don't recommend many books, but this one should be on the top of your reading pile. Once you read it you will understand why and I'm willing to bet you will recommend it to all of your friends."
2,Informative Book,"This was the third ""how to"" book I have read and this one really does help! The other books I read on this subject were terribly written and the author was just trying to sell stuff from his mail order business. Not this book! The author really explains how to get things going and she presents the information in a well written organized manner. I just finished this book and I now know where to start. Other books are just direct mailers this book really informs you."
2,Indeed,"people classify Transplants as being Punk-hip hop crossover, but that's not what they really are. They are more like a genre that takes from punk, reggea, hard rock, soul,and Hip-Hop. They are mostly a punk band, though. This is a really enjoyable album, the only bad song is ""what i can't describe."" I recomend this album, but first buy a Rancid c.d."
2,Excellent Stories Begin What Promises To Be An Excellent Series!,"These first-two-books-in-one begin the Cynster series and an excellent beginning it is! Since DEVIL'S BRIDE and A RAKE'S VOW are the first two books, I suggest you look under each title for the individual reviews. I thoroughly enjoyed them both! I'm looking forward to reading more of her novels and continuing the Cynster series!"
2,A eclectic collection of Prince hits,"This hits collection provides an eclectic mix of Prince tunes, mostly of the sexier, darker, and more soulful variety. We get a peek into Prince's mega-hit Purple Rain with ""I Would Die 4 U"" and an extended version of the title track. There are also some lighter pop hits (""Little Red Corvette"" and ""Raspberry Beret"") as well as the later chart topper, ""Cream."" Finally, the compilation includes a few lesser known hits such as ""Controversy"" and ""Delirious"" plus a number of songs which never saw any radio play. For die-hard Prince fans, this collection is a must-have, but more casual fans may struggle to recognize many of the songs here."
2,Best available on this topic.,"This can be a tough book to digest. You might find it more comprehensible if you first read some evolutionary psychology, like books by Matt Ridley or Helen Fisher.Once you've accepted that men and women are very different creatures, this book can change your life. It's for men of all ages, about women of all ages, title notwithstanding.The author is also available on a live radio call-in show. Got to live365 dot-com and search for him. The show is called ""Dating and Mating""."
2,Awesome!,"This item took only a couple of days to arrive. I bought it used & it plays perfectly. I grew up watching the Christopher Reeve Superman movies. It's great to have all the movies on dvd, especially having both versions of Superman II."
2,EXCELLENT CD,THIS BAND IS INCREDIBLE. THE MUSIC IS ORIGINAL AND THE LEAD SINGERS VOICE IS AMAZING. IT IS A MUST HAVE.
2,Cute Movie,My 5 year old daughter LOVES anything Barbie and she loves this movie! I even bought the dress up gown from Target after she watched it :)
2,Great set of tools,"I use this toolkit at work all the time and have seldom needed to reach for something not in the kit. I received the same kit for a Christmas present and couldn't be happier. The set is pretty complete, especially for computer repair, and I've yet to break a piece. The only issue is the small, dim flashlight, but I didn't knock a star for it because my work area is well-lit and I already have several good flashlights so I'll never use it. So five stars for this awesome little set!"
2,Did not receive what I ordered.,I did not receive the CD I ordered. Instead I received one I already had. Sorry no review. I ordered it because I previously had it and it was fabulous.
2,Love them!,Got them for my son as a Christmas present. He said they are the best! Very comfy! They run a half size small...so suggest you order a size up.
2,Wusthof Classic 10-Inch Spatula,I iced Christmas cake with this like a dream. It also worked under the cake to remove it from the flat pan. A must for every kitchen.
2,Masterpiece...don't listen to naysayers,"This album is a masterpiece! Screw the idiotic critics who call Bruce Springsteen ""talented."" The only low point on the album is the rap in American Life, an otherwise good song. ""Nothing Fails,"" ""Intervention,"" and ""Nobody Knows Me"" are Madonna at her best."
2,Not your standard graphic novel,"""Arkham Asylum"" is a dark story. The inmates at Gotham's repository for the criminally insane riot and take hostages, offering to release them if Batman will come and spend the day - April 1, no less - with them. Needless to say, Batman goes in, and the day turns into a hellish trip into his own psyche.The first thing you will notice about ""Arkham Asylum"" is that it looks different from any normal comic. The art looks like a mix of painting and photography, lending an appropriate amount of otherworldliness to an incredibly twisted story.One thing I really like about this particular edition is that the original script is included as an addendum - it's a good side companion, explaining the myriad plot points in detail and weaving all the themes together and explaining them nicely."
2,Keep your eye on this author!,"Tainted Blood has all the elements of a first-rate thiller and then some. When Pete Cochran's wife dies, he and his two children move to Buckthorn, Oregon to live with his in-laws. Something his wife made him promise not to do. What Pete does not know is that for the past eighteen years, Buckthorn has been troubled by the brutal slaying of young men. With his over zealous in-laws, a nephew who is diagnosed as the ""stuff made of monsters,"" and a lover that looks remarkably like his wife, Pete has to leave town before becoming the killer's next victim.Tainted Blood is one heart pounding, in-your-face of a thriller. Just when you think you've figured out what happens next, the unexpected happens."
2,Very good novel,I enjoyed the book very much. The action in the book made the book so that you didn't want to put it down.
2,Dome Auto Mileage Log Book,"An excellent item to maintain Automobile Expenses, Miles Per Gallon, Changes in Price per gallon, and itemizing business mileage for tax purposes."
2,Wrong color shipped,"I ordered the item in aqua, it arrived in mustard yellow. The mistake was discovered too close to New Year's, and I ended up paying extra for express shipping of the (hopefully) aqua-colored item."
2,A complete narrative,"Although I am not usually a fan of science fiction, I found this book to be as detailed and fast-paced as Dan Brown's DaVinci Code or Angels and Demons. The strength lies in the completeness of the world that Stark has created with its numerous characters and descriptive settings. It was also thought-provoking in its comments on organized religion, humankind's need to believe, and the quest for power by those who control the delivery of the myth to the masses."
2,Simply magnificent!,"Lamb took me to a journey of entertainment and inquiry! Fascinating call to revisiting and expanding knowledge of geography and history! Combine it with Google Earth and Wiki, and you are in for a lot of fun!"
2,Wonderfull !!,As a die-hard Queen fan I found these orchestral versions very good.Also highly recommendable for the ones who never met Queen before.
2,I LOVE this cd,"I purchased this cd because my cousin used to listen to Stan Getz, when I was young! I really didn't appreciatejazz then, but I do now!! This music is so AWESOME, I've never listen to Moonlight in Vermont, so beautifully!!It was DEFINITELY worth what I paid for it/the FIVE stars I'm giving it!!"
2,WONDERFUL COLLECTION OF ROMANTIC SHORT STORIES,"Girlfriends is a wonderful three short story collection of soft romantic stories about relationships with women's best friend. Each of the stories are differet and portray a wonderful and realistic message about women and their closeness. I enjoyed each of the stories-they were page turners and could not put the book down. Each was a positive story about African American women - love, support, jealousy, forgivnes,and keeping omn keeping on. What wa sunique about each of the stories is that the ending is lefyt for the reader to wonder. You wil become so engrossed ine ach story and hav eyyour own thoughts about how you wish the romantic relationship will end. A GREAT READ A MUST!!!"
2,This product was good,This product was good. The book appeared to be brand new and looked as if it has never been used.
2,Positively Reinforcing !,"This is a must read for anyone studying applied behavioral analysis, preparing for a teaching career, business career, getting married or becoming a parent! Karen Pryor presents applied behavioral analysis in clear, easy to understand language. Her writing style is easy to follow and you will learn more about behavioral science than you ever thought possible. This book is an excellent text that can be used to teach a college level class or as a relaxing read to learn how you can become a better person. As strange as it sounds, you will be prepared to train and teach your dog, your boss, co-worker, spouse or improve your own habits! I've used this book in college classes and I buy a revised edition each time one is issued."
2,"More of Jessica Biel, please...","Summer Catch brings to the screen the story of a hard working young man who takes part in a summer baseball tournament as a pitcher, hoping to make it to the major league. In order to make it big though, he needs to watch out for his worst enemy... himself.Freddie Prinze Jr., Jessica Biel (who is GORGEOUS!), Matthew Lillard, Beverly D'Angelo (who is HOT!), Fred Ward, and the rest of the cast carry out their performances very well.The setting, the plot, the music (!) and the dialogues are all wonderful!In a nutshell, it's probably not a movie you would want to add to your collection, but it will surely provide for an evening's entertainment."
2,sad but true,"man, i absolutely loved this series. the music, the humor, the tricks, the premise????? This show is absolutely enticing and everyone of watches it knows that its faithful to the manga in every way. except.........it cuts the series short at 26 episodes. omg i cant believe how crappy the ending was. by far the worst ending ive ever seen next to Claymore. (another series plagued because the manga still isnt done) Air gear however has finished its manga run. SO SOMEBODY BETTER MAKE THE WHOLE DANG THING. But this is really really great. what i recommend is buy this, then read the whole manga after. it gets pretty crazy and Iki just keeps getting more and more cool.but the ending is the only thing making it shy of 5 stars."
2,Kinski is stunning though parts are missing,"The story of Tess is brought to life by Polanski who does an excellent job of creating Hardy's England. Kinski stands out as a vuluptous Tess. The story however leaves out some of the important details such as the death of Prince, the Durbeyfiled horse, which leads to Tess going to the home of the sham-D'Urbervilles. Though not quite up to par with the 1998 A&E version of the novel, Natasha Kinski remains as a striking image in the viewers mind well after the video is over."
2,Oddball Paradise,"This book in its entirety is certainly a page-turner, but am I the only one who is fascinated by the oddball stories like the America Online celebrity stalker and the sad culture of cookware cowboys? Tinseltown is more twisted than I'd ever imagined!"
2,One of the best of the soul era,"Anyone who remembers the music of the late 50's and the sounds of the soul era must have this album. Smokey and the Miracles take you from the highs to the lows...alternately clapping and crying. Although not all of thes songs were tremendous hits, you'll remember them from somewhere."
2,Gets the idea across,This documentary gets the idea across that simple stupidity is still the major cause of environmental degradation on this planet. Sharks are magnificent but are being hunted to extinction worldwide to feed the Asian superstition industry. Come on people. Pull your heads out of your rear ends.I bought a copy and circulated it with my friends at work who don't get out as much.
2,"""Where the speechless unite in a silent accord""","I'm a big fan of PF. I do agree this is not their best album... Nevertheless, and despite the 80's sound on it (specially on the drums), the lyrics are great. Sorrow, for instance, is a masterpiece (though I like the PULSE version a little more). On The Turning Away has a great solo, very Gilmour-like. I would not say this is a bad album. It was a new start... which would be concluded later on with The Division Bell. I guess you only need some time to get used to it, if you're new to Pink Floyd.For more experienced listeners, though, it is notable that the sound somehow went back a little. I think the Meddle sounds more 'alive' and 'Floydian'."
2,Family fun,"Good to be able to watch a movie with your kids and not have to worry about the language. I started my daughter on Doris Day movies when she was young, and now at 14 we can enjoy them together. Not quite as many laughs, but still classic Doris Day."
2,These do a good job at an excellent price.,"If you can combine any coupon listed on the product page (occasionally offered) with subscribe and save, these Amazon diaper deals are excellent. These pampers have done a fine job for our little one and I have no complaints. We have used cloth, but with the recently larger and more frequent poopin going on the last few months, with the addition of more baby food, these diapers make things easier for me. The other benefit, of course, is they soak up more of the liquid stuff as well."
2,Absolutely Delightful,"A fantastic show for babies, toddlers, children, and adults of all ages. A bold claim, but this series backs it up! Adorable animation, famous works of art, breathtaking and moving music all combine to relax and entertain the entire family. THIS is what I expected Baby Einstein would be! As other reviewers have mentioned, skip the B.E. and buy Classical Baby!"
2,Great DVD Case - Quick Service,Very good quality product. Priced right. Should last forever. Delivery was very fast. No complaints at all. I'd buy another.
2,very good,"runs great,light at night, day and month,with a non hair pulling band,have had for couple of months, still runs like the day i bought it."
2,great present for dad,My dad loves this and uses it all the time. The only thing i can think of that would make it better would be to make the light 360 degrees. But it is very bright and I love the hook at the top that extends. The cordless aspect of it is wonderful.
2,Hubby birthday gift,I bought this for my hubby for his birthday. He is a huge sports fan. He loves it...so if he loves it then I love it. He can't wait for the next volumes to come out because I think he will be interested in more of the stories on the newer volumes.
2,Don't cry over lost teeth,"Even though it happens to everyone, losing a tooth for the first time can make kids a little nervous or apprehensive. ""Arthur's Tooth"" offers a funny story that helps make the loss of baby teeth less scary. It shows kids that they are not alone in losing their teeth, while also telling a story that is silly enough to keep kids engaged (I like The Brain's tooth odd-looking extraction contraption.)The book even manages to pass a long a few educational bits, such as ""Between the ages of four and seven, everyone begins to lose their deciduous, or baby, teeth."""
2,Short & Concise Catholic Apologetics,"An all-around decent and easy to understand apologetics book that teaches basic truths of the Catholic faith. Keating has a very ""no nonsense"" style of writing -- he tells the truth like it is and does not worry about what one may think. For this book's purposes, his voice works well to defend Catholic customs and beliefs that have been under attack by various groups.While I personally like Keating, I wouldn't necessarily recommend him immediately to someone who knows absolutely nothing about Catholicism or to those who aren't open-minded towards it. There are other authors who can introduce you to the truths of Catholicism in a gentler yet, honest tone. Rather, I would recommend this to Catholics seeking to understand traditions in their faith better as well as those who take issue with Catholic beliefs and seek a very basic understanding of why we believe what we do."
2,This Book is a Miralce!,"This book introduces an exercise system based on ""Tiger Moves."" The system is extremely effective yet takes only twenty minutes a day and can be done anywhere and anytime without equipment. The Miracle Seven use isometric exercises in a program that delivers strength and muscle mass, endurance and a lean body, balance and flexibility, and power -- all in less than an hour a day. In twenty minutes a day, The Miracle Seven deliver a type of fitness that improves your life in almost every way."
2,A 15 year olds point of view,I thought that this was a great book. It gave you all the important things that you needed to know about the first four seasons. I think that they need to do another one about the rest of the seasons because I would like to know more about the show if I have not seen an epsoide and I can get the facts from that book. I just think that it is a great book to have if you want to have something to read and it is not rude. I think think that it is peaceful for the mind and soul. Read the book I know that you will love it. One last note I think that if a 15 year old likes it that anyone would like it.
2,FIVE STAR FUN,This is an INCREDIBLE recording! It is so upbeat and joyful that every time i hear it i wish to get up and dance in the grassy fields of my youth. Buy it today.
2,Amazing clone trooper blaster,"It's amazing. You buy lightsabers but then, whoa! A blaster? That's just awesome and with sound effects!"
2,Always trust monin,"Monin is really the best flavored syrup to use. Why? Because it uses actual cane sugar. You don't get a watery syrup or weird after taste. It's really delicious, any one you get.I bought this for my boyfriend as a birthday present because he loves those cinnamon dulces at Starbucks. I've worked as a barista with Pete's Coffee and we used monin in everything. I told him if you make coffee with half and half and this cinnamon monin you'd have the same thing. I was right. He loved it."
2,it was a good movie,"I love to watch dance movie. It was so cool to dance like that. Glad that he went back w/ her in the end, didnt he?"
2,Breakthrough Book!,"This book is one of the best I've read on sales management and overall business strategies in years.The principles and ideas Brooks presents in ""The New Science"" are causing me to re-think the way I'm running my operation...and I've been running a sales-driven organization for over 30 years!I'd highly recommend this book to anyone whose income and success are driven by the performance of a sales team."
2,Finally an Archie video!,"I was so excited to find out that there is a new Archie video available. Although I must say I was kinda disappointed that its about ghosts and zombies. I would love to see a video with funny stories about the gang (just like in the comic books). My 4-yr old daughter got so scared of it that she had nightmares after watching it. I don't recommend it to kids 5 and under. Its really nice to see them in animation, I wish there would be more in the future. What can I say? I'm an Archie fan since I can remember. Whatever story they would come up - I'll still collect them all!"
2,Good markers.,"We do a lot of dry-erasing where I work and we struggled for a while with markers that would dry out easily. Whether it was a issue of people not replacing the caps or just faulty markers, I don't know. But I do know that these markers have held up to the test of being repeatedly used and occasionally being left uncapped. It's been well over a month and the 6 marker set that I took in is still going!"
2,a pleasant surprise,"more ""pop like"" than I would have imagined, but very good. The first 4-5 songs are the best. Worth the [money]."
2,Boz never disappoints,"I have not heard the enhanced stero side to this combo CD/DVD, but was so pleasantly surprised to hear Boz re-doing and refining some of his past music. The instrumentation and vocals are just splendid, and he always commands the best session men--Ricky Fataar ( a former Beach Boy, if you can believe it), Hutch, Paich, et al totally support Boz's unbelievable voice and styling on every cut. Not a weak one in the bunch. You dazzle me, Boz. And High Sierra just has to be on anyone's list for best written, performed, and produced cuts. Kudos, Boz!"
2,This is one of the best albums ever!,"This is one great album.I only recieved it in the mail today but I have already listened to it three times in full.This is great collection of songs, songs that will surely make your fist rise into the air. Songs like the title track, 'Delivering the goods' and 'The green Manalishi' are abseloute classics.The sound quality on this album is not perfect and you have to turn it up louder than a normal CD to get the same actual volume level (Meaning that when you play it on ten, it sounds like eight), but this is a truly great album and if you can't play it loud enough you should buy a louder stereo (I'm gonna!).This album is a classic!"
2,The SHADOW,"I will never be able to understand why THE SHADOW (1994) is so underrated. Sure, there are things I would have changed, but--the acting was convincing, the special effects dazzling, the dialog witty--and it the film was appropriately set in New York.The film borrows from both the pulps and the radio show. The Shadow is appropriately clad with an eerie, echoing voice. Shiwan Khan is properly cruel but humorous (how can a Tibetan have pupils THAT big??)This is not exactly a family movie. There is some language, a scene with scantily-clad concubines. Oh, and the demon-possessed knife called the Purba.Overall, a faithfully adapted crime fighter/superhero movie. Highly recommended."
2,This book is TOTALLY OUTRAGEOUS!!,"This book is great because it has lots of details and great drawings. It tells about how Amelia feels and talks about what is happening in her life. Amelia is a girl that moved to her new house and goes to a new school and misses her best friend Nadia. She's a girl who has a hard time meeting new teachers and students. That is how I know if she has problems in her life. This book is about what had happened in her girl culture. This book made me feel like laughing when it talked about Cleo picking her nose and not eating properly. This book made me sad when she didn't meet any friends and it also made me sad when she didn't like her new house. I understand her because when I first went to my new house I didn't like my house that much either. This book is a blast so you should buy the book and see what happens. I would highly, I mean HIGHLY recommend this book."
2,A very solid album,"Long story short, this is the most interesting album I have bought in a long time. At first the very idea of a reggae metal fusion sounds like it would NEVER work. However, Skindred pulls it off beautifully.The track that initally drew me in was ""Nobody"" (I heard it on the radio) because of the hard riffs coupled with the very uniique vocals. After hearing the song a couple times I had to get this CD. The rest of the CD is filled with the same level of energy and excitement. My other favorites are ""Set It Off"" and "" Selector"" because they seem to be more upbeat and more fun, if that makes the least bit of sense.The only reason I didn't give this CD 5 stars is because the whole CD just seemed a little too radio friendly and upbeat. But I just attribute this to the fact that I mostly listen to Slipknot, Rage Against the Machine, and The Polyphonic Spree (Think about that for a while!!!!). All in all, I HIGHLY recommend anyone getting this CD."
2,Entertaining and kept me turning pages.,"Somehow I missed this book in the Stone Barrington series, so I checked it out from the library. Even though this is the 5th or 6th book, I was still able to read it and not feel I missed anything in the series. I think that's a tribute to the author. In my opinion this was an easy, entertaining read, but it still kept me turning the pages. I found that Stone Barrington is back in NYC. My only problem with the story was that about midway the story got a little boring when ""La Biche"" kept changing her identity and it was hard to keep up on who she was at that moment. Overall it was an excellent, and not a serious read but still entertaining. Enjoy."
2,Works great on my vintage lawn tractor!,Well made bowl filter for underneath the gas tank on a riding mower or small tractor. Helps keep debris out of the carb.
2,Very informative,"This book indirectly dispels the false teachings of dispensationalists. If you don't know what a dispensationalist is, all you have to do is go to the prophecy section of Christian bookstores. For some reason inexplicable to me, dispensationalists like Hal Lindsay, Hagee, and Timothy LaHaye, Jenkins, Dave Hunt etc. have a virtual monopoly of the prophecy book shelves. They disseminate some false teachings which are unorthodox and not in accordance with traditional Christian teaching regarding the Church. It's nice to get a dose of reality for a change."
2,This is so good--,"not a bad track on this cd. Steve Earle is one of the best songwriters of our time. My only complaint is that it doesn't last long enough--but that's O.K., I can just play it over and over again. My personal favorites are ""Hard Core Troubadour"" and ""Billy and Bonnie"" but I really like every song. No one can combine Rock with Bluegrass like Steve Earle. It seems he just keeps getting better with every album. If you liked his other stuff, you will like this one, too."
2,Love it,I love this movie. I have been trying to find it on video. But I CANT seem to find it. If anyone knows where I can find it. please let me know
2,Be a Pokemon Master.,"This product is ok if you play any RPG style games. Pokemon being the best game for the gameshark. Who wants o travel (or pay for their kids trip) accross the country to attend a Nintendo convention to get one or two pokemon only obtainable through the event? Especially when you could dish out $30 instead of $400 to just do it right in the comfort of your own home?Final Fantasy is also another series that clicks well with this device.Parents, are you frustrated with hearing your kids scream and get upset over not being able to play the game without loosing? This device will help them surpass their trials and saves you the frustrated tearfilled child, and grants you a moments peace."
2,As expected,It works well in my labeling machine. Relatively cheap (at least at the time I ordered it).
2,Rude Awakening,This DVD is very good sound quality and the the footage is spectacular. But it lists the songs on the back and they are not in order some are in special features.
2,A good start,"This is a good book when getting started with rolling out CRM. It has a lot of info on making system customizations that help in getting CRM to display exactly what you need. This book doesn't cover everything; so, it's not a be all end all. However, it's worth the money for the info it does cover. It's definitely not a book for end-users, this covers administrative tasks."
2,AWESOME! very unique,The Bagpipes never sounded so good. The Wicked Tinkers have made the Scottish pipes an instrument of the 90's and beyond.. This is an album you could listen to all day long!
2,good cd but not awesome !,Witch is a good band w/ J mascis on drums !from Dinosaur Jr fame ! SST records legend.like usual - J and crew are best to be seen live!pretty good metal CD !
2,Hard Working Sander,"I have had an excellent experience with this sander. It handles all jobs, big and small, and cost next to nothing. I have built at least 35 different projects and have used this sander for a wide range of applications, from stripping to finish sanding. The only problem I am having is finding a new pad for it. Nobody seems to carry it. I guess it is considered a disposable sander."
2,Rocky!...Rocky!...Rocky..!!!,"I bought this after I read some of the mixed reviews on here & decided to get it to not only decide for myself wether i like this or not but it was on sale & it was an anthology I had always wanted but thought it was a little to pricey for $60 so when I saw it for half price I thought I had to get it. Now, a lot of people complained of a grainy or blurred picture. I guess it is a little grainy if you look close for it but it's an old movie, you know? You're not gonna get a picture like say a movie that came out a year ago or something. I've seen the first 3 & I don't really see what the big deal was about all the complaints. And of course the movies themselves are just awesome. Would definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys Rocky movies"
2,Life in poetry,"Okita is a poet with a unique style. If you are looking for poetry that is off the main stream, but quite artistic, his work is for you.When creating the setting for the poem, pieces of the environment are linked to emotions, creating a world of the tangible that creates a better understanding of the intangible. ""Love, that busy street"" is the environment for ""Crossing with the Light"". In ""Kitchen"" the room is really more like a secluded cell for the main female character. ""Parachute"" takes Dwight and his friend on a playground swing ride of human relations.And there are many other poems to explore in this collection. Give this one a chance and you won't be disappointed."
2,"DO THE MATH, BATMAN RETURNS WAS NOT A FLOP!","Listen here, Elizabeth from Bay Area California, Batman Returns was by no means a ""box-office failure"". The budget for the movie was 80$ million dollars and it made 162$ million domestically. While that is not as succesful as the first or third movies, a movie that doubles its own production cost absolutley cannot be considered a flop, no matter how you look at it. And by the way, making over 280$ million worldwide is hardly miserable."
2,Finally! Non-plastic children's cookware!,"I was thrilled to find this set of cookware that wasn't plastic, however I'm pretty disappointed that it bends and dings so easily. I don't expect it to be made of steel, but when 18 month old kids can practically reshape it by hand then we have a problem. I hope the makers revamp it and put a little more strength in the product.All in all, the products are fun, great for imaginative play and fun for babies to clang together."
2,farberware toaster,"excellent toaster. It toasts bagels and of course toast. Wide slots, can observe the toasting process. It has a handy ""Cancel"" button, with a blue indicator so you know where the butten is located. I love it and have perfect toast each time. I highly recommend it."
2,Fantastic product!!,Out of the box I gave it a rinse and wipe-down. Preheated the pan to 200F in the oven while I mixed the cornbread batter. Pulled the pan and adjusted the oven temp for cooking. Sprayed a small shot of Crisco in each pocket then poured in the batter (2/3 full) and slid it back in the oven at 400F for 20 minutes. The cornbread biscuits were perfect and came right out of the pan. I love this cast iron pan!!
2,Closest thing to an oracle,"This is a good magazine for hindsight. It shows how things come about in the word. There is just about as much information on politics and/or just the way key people think around the world, and the results of their decisions.Instead of being just a hindsight magazine, this magazine is also capable of foresight, it was able to successfully predict the outcome of the German elections and what it means to US-German relationships. During the process of the4 election I could keep up due to the articles in ""The Economist.""Many times there are items that are not directly related to the economy. They discuss such items as pre-Islamic Iran, to the demise of the Telephone Business due to VOIP.Any one article is worth the price of the magazine. However this magazine is packed with articles and insights that you may or may not have thought of.They also do not seem to be shy about giving opinions. It is fun to see how close their opinions and perditions come to fruition."
2,Pleased with these Shakes.,"I found the shakes to be very tasty and satisfying. I've ordered this multiple times and have had one case that turned out to be a little chunky. I determined that if I put the shakes into the fridge immediately, it's fine - but if i order 2 or more cases and leave them out until needed, they tend to get chunky - probably from getting too warm in the house. That's my theory anyway."
2,I know!,"I want to know what happened to Unsexy too.. unless it's hiden and I have yet to find it. I do really like the cd, but I was really really sad to not find unsexy. Mine isn't on the cover either =o("
2,More Great Gems from this Amazing Group,"I was pleased to be able to purchase this fine cd - a great blend of vocal pop from the group, some lovely duo harmonies similar to the Everly Brothers and some fine solo recordings all from the Hickory Studios. I will add this to my many recordings of The Newbeats. BREAD and BUTTER to all pop enthusiasts."
2,Wonderful product!,"I was very satisfied with the service I received when I bought this item as it came on time and was neatly and carefully packaged. The product itself is very good and I'm optimistic that it be of a great help to my hair (so far, so good)."
2,Good But Just ok,"I had listened to the black eyed peas but, At times they started to anoy me they are a bore and anoying especially My humps I have came to Hate that song But, on the other hand good ones are Don't Phunk With my heart.and Don't lie, pump it, and #7 I cant remember what it is called. over all good."
2,Phenomenal,This product has proven itself over and over. This is my second box of 100. I use these every window because my finger tips always get cracks during the winter. A little Neo and a Band-Aid.
2,"Good mic, gotta change the settings","This is a great mic for the price, just know you will have to go into the settings and turn the gain way up if you want anyone to be able to hear you."
2,I'm not disappointed...,"Usually when musicians have an amazing first album such as Bebo did with ""Ten Thousand Days,"" it's hard to follow it up with another one up to par. Bebo however does not have this problem. ""Big Blue Sky"" is great CD with some really great songs on it. My personal favorites are ""Cover Me"",""Underneath"", ""Tip of My Heart"" and ""All That I Have Sown."" This CD encompasses many different styles of music. Bebo brings it all together with his awesome lyrics and melodies. I can't wait to see what he comes up with next."
2,Honeycomb is Outstanding!,"Honeycomb is a far cry from Frank Black's beginnings with the Pixies, but give this album a chance. It's another instant classic, and it will grow on you. Frank Black is an unstoppable force. What a talent."
2,All I can say is Money...,"Want a movie that will strike a strong comedy blend yet also have deeper meaning? Try Swingers. It is the most ingenious movie I have ever seen on any screen. The first time I saw it, I went out and bought it. I would say I have seen it about 50 times and it never gets old. If you have the extra 15 bucks, buy this movie! You won't be disappointed."
2,Rare Bird pure class,"Epic Forest is a fantastic cd from a superb band.This band can rock with the best, but also has a melodic side, and with the fine vocals of Steve Gould and the sublime keyboards of David Kaffinetti the quality of the music is sustained throughout.This Album was first released in 1973, but such is the quality of the music and the musicians ,it easily stands the test of time.This CD is highly recommended!!"
2,Awesome book,This is a wonderful story that just goes to show that true literature can be told through a comic book.I had never taken a comic or graphic novel seriously until I found Usagi.A must read!!
2,WeAre Marshall,"This move is without a doubt the very best movie I have ever seen. Being a true story and how the whole town faced adversity and moved forward with their broken hearts. I wish every man, woman, boy, girl and every young person that plays any sport watch this movie. There's more to the movie than the story of football. It tells the story of life. Wonderful great movie. I'm buying this movie so I can share this story with as many people that I know and will share this wonderful story with."
2,cinema type excitment,"Macon County line is a sure thriller.It leaves you with the feeling of ""Could this happen to me"". Out of his role of Jethro Bodine,Max Baer is truly convincing as the sheriff every small town seems to have. The story is based on fact .Two teens are senselessly murded and another is scarred for life, just for being in the wrong place at the wrong time.A true classic,Macon County Line Is a roller coaster ride of thrills and suspense every minute. You WLL ENJOY this film."
2,Great Classic,"A great read for children, young adult, adult, and everyone!I read this as a kid in elementary school and now as an adult I picked it up again. 20 years later, I fell in love again.The prose is well-written, the plot is action-packed, and the characters have depth. Authors today could learn a thing or two from the classics. The wolf-buddies of White Fang have more personality and depth than the main werewolf in Twilight."
2,Blueprint for Health Living,"I wanted to make some significant lifestyle changes. I had seen Ellie Krieger on the Food Network so I decided to purchase both of her books. She offers straightforward advice on how to make healthy choices and include more whole grain foods, fruits and vegetables and lean proteins in your diet. She also advises people to move more and stretch. I love the recipes!"
2,ALONG THE WAY,BEST BOOK ON THE MARKET. IT MOTIVATES PEOPLE TO NEVER GIVE UP DESPITE TRIALS AND TRIBULATIONS. HOLD ON TO HOPE AND IN THE END IT WILL BE REWARDED. THIS IS A MUST READ.
2,I t Touches Your Heart,"Lonna Lisa Williams is a writer who touches the heart of her readers. She attacks a difficult subject and makes it funny, interesting, and inspirational. She will draw you into her world."
2,"Punchy, punk-ish, straight ahead rock 'n'roll","Together with thrash wonder guitarist Robert Quine, Reed takes the stage to rush through a set of songs that will leave you panting just by listening. The key here is speed as the band delivers punk-ish and bare bones renditions that gallop along like a maniac on a mission. Add to this Quine's frenzied morse code solos and led heavy rhythm and the effect is nothing short of stunning. Reed's voice (he still growls and sings here) is irreverent and wrathful while the rest of the band contribute to the no-nonsense driving pace (Maher's drums) and timely countermelody (Saunder's bass). Live recordings seldom sounded this raw and enthralling. Without a doubt, Reed's best album of the 80's."
2,good customer service,"The first one I bought was DOA and they shipped me a new one for free the next day. The battery works fine, fits perfectly and most importantly, charges!"
2,Useful and easy-to-understand,As an English teacher I need many resources to help students write better. This book as given me multiple exercises that reinforce my lessons and really drives home the messages. I'm glad I bought it! It's saved me hours of putting together my own notes.
2,Good basic printer,The reason I selected this printer is for the fact that the paper is enclosed in a covered area rather than just being left out open on a paper-feed tray. This helps keep the paper from becoming damaged by having the edges bent which would cause paper jams or the paper becoming dirty. (you'd be amazed at how many people eat stuff while hanging around the office printer while waiting for their documents to print.)
2,Awesome Action Movie,"This is perhaps one of the best ever action movies, of all time. When the king of Sparta wishes to defend his land, and his people against overwhelming odds of the incoming Persian army. He is avised that he cannot send the Spartan Army, so he ""Goes for a stroll, with 300 bodyguards."" In order to defend all that is at their core, to the death if that is what it takes. Breathtakingly stunning visual effects, and some cool as hell battle sequences that are on par with special effects like the matrix. Extraordinary! On this edition, the only special feature is commentary if that is your thing, if you want more, seek out another version, like the 2 disc sp edition. Otherwise this is one fantastic movie, that goes on my list as a best, favorite!"
2,Linguistics textbook,"I bought this book for my ""Languages in Pluralistic America"" class. I found this book very informative presented in a very accessible manner. Each chapter deals with a separate topic doing a great job in outlining the key points giving the reader a wonderful overview without deviating into boring and needless details. Though one can not consider it a literature book, it is nevertheless not like a traditional textbook either, which certainly helps in keeping the reader entertained."
2,Pedometer,Decent pedometer; only complaint is that the belt clamp is small enough that the meter falls off easier than expected/desired.
2,"Feisty, fun and highly entertaining",This book is great for someone with a little imagination. It talks of dragons as if they are real creatures of today. It is almost a field guide to dragons. It's fun for all ages.
2,Very comfortable sandals,Love these. Super comfy. They stay on. They're quiet. They go with everything. Can't wait to buy more in all kinds of colors.
2,baby gate extension,"shipped on time, received in good condition, product is effective and looks great."
2,Amazing book,"My review on this book: amazing. This book is incredible and a must read for any Disney lover. I had never read a biography and was hesitant because I thought it might be boring. But it was very interesting and I couldn't put it down. I am a huge Disney fan and this book incredibly made me love Disney more. It gives a detailed look into the life of a great man and a good look into how Disney movies and parks were made. I just wish it was longer because I want more!My review on amazon: Terrible. They took very long to ship the book, then it took even longer to get here. I paid extra to have a new version and I do not believe it was new. There were some marks on my book and the other one I ordered. The book was so good though I have gotten past the terrible service."
2,Way to Go Kelly!!!,"I love this album! Kelly has to be the best American Idol! She has been so successful in her music career. This album has very powerful, meaningful lyrics along with Kelly Clarkson's amazing voice! You just want to keep listening to it. My favorite songs on the album are Never Again, One Minute, Sober, Haunted and Yeah. If you love her like I do, go out and buy the album! You wont be disappointed!"
2,Great and Detailed Book!,"Definitely the best book on the Austin Healey 100, but not just because it's the only book. When it says IN DETAIL, it means it. A lot of information I was unaware of, particularly with the 100S. I owned a 100M, sold it when cheap and regret it now that they're multiple thousands of dollars. But I still love to remember the ""good old days"". ;-)"
2,the perfect combo!,"I couldn't be happier that these Aussies hooked up for a program. My 2 year old loves the Wiggles and the Crocodile Hunter. The songs are all about animals and are catchy. My only complaint would be that she loves it too much! Even I find myself singing the songs! If your children like the Wiggles and animals, then this is the DVD for you!"
2,I only know one song,"I only just learned today who sang the song""First day of spring"", but I had to write and tell people it is probably the best song in the world and I am currently trying to find the cd so I can listen to this group in its entirety."
2,great book,very interesting and good. so many years and still true! looks like statistics never change. should be read by everyone.
2,Best Dressed Pooch,"My dog was slightly larger than the measurements, but I just put some velcro on the flap under his belly and it fit perfectly. No sewing, just attached the velcro to each side."
2,Foot Pedal Power Supply,"This is just what I needed for my Digitech foot pedal. Great going. Hooked it right up, worked the first time. Still working."
2,I recommend this book,"I like Lemony Snicket's books because they are full of suspense. For instance, at the end of The Hostile Hospital they are in their enemy's car trunk! I believe the mysterious Beatrice is the Baudelaire's mother. Compared with Harry Potter, it is sadder because bad things keep happening to the Baudelaires but the stories are still very exciting."

2,Remember this is FICTION!,"I am almost through the final chapter of this book and want to remind readers that this book is a work of fiction! So any discrepancies or expansions on the truth were the author's perogative! Who cares if lions don't live in this part of Africa? Who cares if the savannah and the rainforest cannot exist in the same geographic area? It works with the story and makes it a spellbinding tale if you remember to give up any need for total factual reality. Perhaps the author is trying to make political statements; if you take the book as pure entertainment (however gutwrenching it can be at times), it is worth the read. I am reminded of the Clan of the Cave Bear series, the proverbial caveman soap opera, which was also criticized for its lack of accuracy. Who cares - did it keep your attention and did you enjoy reading it?"
2,great presenters with annoying audience,"Brilliant and amazing information. But right when it gets interesting, someone in the audience has to cough or sneeze or move papers, or do something to distract from the presentation. Frankly, Im suprised that all these brilliant people dont move their symposium to somewhere in the US, where they have better facilities with more advanced graphics, and able to not have to hear the rude audience's bodily functions."
2,I didn't know and now I know,"I think that Mr. Gore has really placed ""environmentalists' foot in the door"" with this book about the truth of global warming. On started the book not having much previous knowledge about the issue of global warming, but I believe that Gore really backs this ""inconvenient truth"" about global warming with abundant charts and statistics legitimizing it. I have to admit that in the last election I voted republican, but this issue extends further than the lines of political parties because it involves the fate of the whole country much less the world. If you are at all skeptical about the issue of global warming I dare you to read this book and learn why it truly is a problem and why scientists' opinions are starting to converge more and more that global warming could have devasting effects on the future of the world if it isn't controlled."
2,Worth a look,"Not quite PURPLE RAIN, but noteworthy to devotees like myself. The soundtrack is 60% flawless and the re-appearance of Morris Day and the Time, and Jill Jones made me so happy. And Tevin Campbell and Mavis Staples...totally worth a golden Sunday afternoon's viewing despite all of the eggs and tomatoes thrown at it..."
2,"Watts k-1 Icemaker Kit, 25-feet","Easy to install, and came with all the parts i needed and then some. I had no trouble tying it into my newer model Kenmore fridge and would highly reccomend the kit for any ice maker installation from any manufacturer.My only advice is not to be afraid to really tighten both connections; They aren't designed to be gingerly tightened, you are securing live plumbing! All i needed were two adjustable wrenches."
2,best tool i've bought,"I do a lot of handmade jewelry work, and this tool has been the best i have bought and/or used. Very sharp, durable, and precise. You can get very close clean cuts with it. Well worth the money."
2,Mindblowingly wonderful! Buy this album!,"From the haunting music of Track 1 to the magestic flutes of Track 4, the entire soundtrack utterly floats with the magic of Avalon. The music is very reminscent of England and the original story of The Mists of Avalon.Each track will take you to a different point in the movie. You will celebtrate with Morgaine, and you will cry with her. If you liked the movie, or even the books, I highly recommend this album. Holdridge has captured the magic and mystery of Avalon."
2,"If you only know ""Carmina Burana"", shame!","Aug. 99 marked the 50th anniversary of the first performance of Orff's ""Antigonae""; it's just as beautiful and fresh now as it was then. There are many musical gems to be found here, but first and foremost this setting is musical THEATER; there is an enormous reliance on the unaccompanied voice to carry the weight of Hoederlein's classic German translation of Sophocles' original. Austere and beautiful at once; not soon forgotten."
2,review of trickster's choice,"The book is about this girl named Alianne.She wants to be aspy like her dad, but her mom doesn't want her to follow thesteps of her dad because she said that her dad is unique.This book is really interesting because it talks about thisgirl that talked to godesses, she made deals with them and shefollowed her dreams. She had many adventures and we can seethat she did what her dreams told her to do.I would recommend this book to those people who like storieswith a lot of adventure and imagination, it's reallyinteresting and fun book!!!!!!"
2,Al is Back!,"This CD is a must for serious Al Jarreau fans. Al is back and he has some top musicians along with him. This is my favorite recording since ""Breaking Away"" He has the same type of groove on this CD. I've seen a lot made of the duet with Vanessa Williams on ""God's Gift to the World"" but the cut that makes this CD for me is ""Something That You Said"". Al uses his incredible singing gift and adds some songwriting prowess to take an instrumental song that I already loved and put words to it. If you know ""A Remark You Made"" off the Weather Report ""Heavy Weather"" album, you'll know that Al has outdone himself on this song. A must listen, it is absolutely fabulous. Al's other composition, ""Flame"" is also great. I'm glad Al is back."
2,"Ja Rule, Rules","Ja rule drops another great cd, with songs such as 6 feet underground, the rule just won't die, this cd should be on everyone's to buy list"
2,Shades of our childhood; found it entertaining,"Choppy narrative, jumps from one scene to another, but found it fun to watch, happy, entertaining. Our grandchildren found it equally entertaining--upbeat music, colorful scenes and scenery, dancing, singing, totally light-weight entertainment and just fun."
2,"A long way from a ""downer""","Okay, so that was a cheesy title. But the book was not chessy! I was intrigued by the premise - four very different people meet on the roof of a London highrise on New Years Eve. They are all there for the same reason: to commit suicide. All four characters have different reasons for wanting to off themselves. Some situations are certainly more dire than others, but none are treated as insignificant. In spite of the humor and wit, Hornby does actually manage to illustrate the point that when pain is your own, it seems insurmountable...and then as the book goes along, it drives home that nothing is worth jumping to your messy death. I laughed out loud a few times, even when I wanted to smack a couple of the characters. And Maureen, bless her heart! That's all I've got to say about her.A perfect book? Of course not. So few are. But a very good one, especially if you enjoy Honrby's sense of humor."
2,Great protein,Awesome product to use as meal replacement or after a hard work out. I've tried a lot of of protein shakes in the past and I have to admit that this has to be on of the best tasting ones.
2,Just as good as I remembered it.,"For being one of the first musicals I say, it's still one of the bests. Especailly how all the kids are choreographed perfectly. Great movie for all musical lovers."
2,"""Who's the bimbo playin' on the damn phone?""","""Turpentine"" rains down like beautiful rage, and ""Retard Girl"" is one of the saddest, most raw Hole tracks ever with cutting lyrics(""...lookin' for the friend she made""). The pictures are worth the price alone, but hey the music is some of the best of the 1990's, so you can't go wrong. Hole is no more, I'm sorry to say, but hopefully Courtney won't keep her mouth shut for long. I think the music-biz needs her desperately."
2,More than I expected....,Overall an excellent read. The book not only provides a chronology of the epidemic but also provide a good quick overview of the evoloution of modern Western medicine in the late 18th and early 20th centuries. One criticism: the author overplays the heroism of the protaganists versus the ignorance of government officials and the public.
2,"A fine edition for scholars, students and the general reader","This is another first-rate critical edition from Norton. The text is cleanly printed with careful and accurate annotations. Both the critical and the backgrounds and contexts essays are well chosen. Sections on performance adaptations on stage and screen and on literary, scientific and sociohistorical contexts are particularly useful.One of the best critical essays is the editor's own. A detailed Stevenson chronology and an accurate selected bibliography conclude the volume."
2,Corky's Rub,Smoked some ribs with Corky's rub because I didn't have time to make my own. I may never make my own! The ribs were AWESOME!
2,Virtually fool proof,I have been looking for the RJ45 plugs that allow you to push the wires through the nose to be trimmed off after you crimp. That allows you to confirm each wire is in the proper slot and none are doubled up or held back by the slot dividers. This style is different... it offers a little insert that you slide on the wires before inserting in the plug and crimping..... a very slick feature that speeds assembly and avoids getting two wires in one slot or having a divider push one wire back. Not quite what I was looking for but better than the standard plug end.
2,SS pressure Cooker,"Replacing a old unit from Presto that I can not get a gasket for now. Old 6qt unit was just to small also so this is great in size and in being SS so tomato products can be cooked in it where old aluminum pot was iffy.Great finish and with the new safety locks another worry many have of opening with pressure still in unit can not happen. Handles are spaced far enough out for easy grip, no problem handling the pot even when full and hot."
2,Harmless fun,"This calendar is a staple in our family. I run a ferret shelter for abused and hospice care ferrets, and I enjoy this calendar each year. Ferrets are wonderfully intelligent creatures that love to be played with, coached and trained. They get bored easily, and enjoy interactive playtime. There is nothing wrong about staging photos for a picture. Most of these pictures are done with treats to pose, and lots of computer manipulation anyway. So the calendars are harmless to the ferrets, and actually stimulate them through touch and handling time. Brovo to the photographer!"
2,A war of disaster which created tremendous bloodshed.,"The Killing Fields, introduces the horror that the Cambodians experienced when Khmer Rouge troops invaded their government. Close-up reports on the war was written by an American, Sidney and his Cambodian side-kick Pran. The film contains real images of war, and horrible scenes of flesh rotten skeletons, blood and disgusting sights. This movie is very educational and interesting to watch, but not on a full stomach!"
2,Best Breath Of Fire!,"When I first heard of this game I was skeptic at first, this is because I had beaten all the other BOF games and those were okay, some of them kinda boring (3) but I was wrong! This game is amazing, one of the best RPG's on the playstation. This game is for people who like their rpgs simple but have certain quirks, like the fishing game, which you can use a special fishing rod control, and learning the enemys ablities. Also the plot and the characters rule, to the silent Scias to the funny robot thing, Ershin. The plot is great too, going between two different dragons. Buy this game right now, but, after you beat Final Fantsy IX ^_^"
2,Baby chick goes visiting,"This is a fun and cute little board book. Little Chick is the last chick to be hatched, but the first chick out of the coop. Join Little Chick as he visits the other farm babies and find out how Little Chick gets back to mama. A short and good story for young children with lovely illustrations by the author."
2,Excellant!,"BUNN makes that best coffee maker in the world! This is my third unit over the years and I would not buy another brand and highly recommend it to everyone. When you need Great Coffee FAST, get a BUNN!"
2,Great message delivered with great humor,"My wife and I saw this video at church and loved it. We then bought it and have watched it over and over. The humor is so great and lessons are very informative. I would recommend this video for anyone married, dating, courting, or just want to know something about yourself and the other gender."
2,great starter book,"i have always been really interested in the wiccan religion and since this book had alot of good reviews i started with this. my conclusion is that this is a great ""starter"" book. i enjoyed the book and it answered alot of my questions but it also opened up alot of other questions and i wish it had more info. the book was easy to read but a bit boring in some parts."
2,Viv,"This was one of the best movies I've ever, ever seen. Even though this movie is quite long, It worth seeing again."
2,Comprehensive but totally overwhelming,"Since most of you are probably required to buy this for class like me, this review may not be the most useful. But anyone thinking of buying this should know that it has every possible bit of information about Ancient Greek--and every tidbit, every little comment, is numbered. This means the student ends up reading a chapter, say, on verb stems, and reading numbers 1024 to 1112. Since the data is so organized, you'd think it's an easy reference, but no. If you're looking for something specific, it'll take some wading through numbers and symbols. Whatever you want is definitely in there--it just might take some time to find it."
2,Daughter loves it,"My house is a typical battle of the schools! My husband bought our daughter this as a gift from her grandfather, who Im pretty sure bleeds Maroon & White. Its a little thin, but she loves it."
2,Fantastic,"I have now bought eight X BOX games, and this one is my favourite!! I love it, three of us here in the house are adicted to it, you can each have a career, and then comepete against each other, the graphics are great and so is the game play.. I normally only like racing games, but this one has changed my way of thinking. If you get it you won't regret it."
2,very graphic,"I wasn't sure what to expect when I picked up Travesti. All I knew was that I would be in for a treat just by looking at the cover. Kulick who is an anthropologist who studied the lives transvestites in Brazil as he became friends with them he got all of the inside scoop and included it in his book. He talks about the travestis that come from Italy to do business in Brazil where these things are more acceptable. Some of the people he interviews talk about how they started in the business, they talk about the ups and downs of their jobs. I found some of the stories to be very graphic. The lives of these men are sometimes beyond their choice of living. Some of them believe they were born into it. The stories are very realistic and in some cases tragic. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone whose clsed minded. However if you find it initeresting to read about the harsh realities of the world then this is the book for you."
2,LOVE IT!,Another must read for pregnant women to know all their options about birth. Gives you a beautiful outlook on the birthing experience.
2,"As usual, a very good read.",I really enjoyed it. It was difficult to put down. It even entered my dreams in an intense sort of way. It was a very good read.
2,Awesome movie and quality,"This is one of the best movies I've seen in a while, and the HD DVD quality is awesome."
2,Perfect pair of earrings,I get more compliments on this simpe little pair of earrings. Everyone should have a pair! These fit great and feel wonderful on.
2,Great product,"I have owned many GPS' and this acquires a signal faster and under more cover than any of them. Recorded data doesn't include drop-outs or random points like some other models. I bike to work every day, as well as bike recreationally and competitively. Excellent product at an excellent price."
2,Moby Dick,"It's an old book & a Great story! I started reading it when I was in school but put it aside, now I'm finishing it."
2,A Great Story,"What a great story! I pray that it's true. I was spell bound by Aaron Becker's answers to several questions that I have had about the untimely death of Princess Diana. The novel's complex plot, highlighted with facts and set mostly in Europe, is fresh and thought provoking. I can hardly wait for the movie."
2,Good game.,"I recommend this game. The graphics aren't good, though, they're actually kind of weird, but I guess that doesn't matter much if you're a true poker player; you're basically looking for a challenging match. Well, this game is pretty challenging, and has plenty of tournaments, including the WSOP main event for ""10,000"" entry fee. It has more than 10,000 players so it will take you many hours of play to finish it. I have tried both the PSP version and the XBOX (both are good), but haven't tried the PC one, which is probably pretty bad. All of the WSOP versions are translated horribly to PC games."
2,OH EM GEEEEEE,"this movie is amazing....i actually bought it a while ago. i think EVERYONE needs to see this. dont call yourself punk unless you've seen this film. i would give it 49735847598074867089567958670467 stars.have fun, kids."
2,"Action, action, action...","Characters are developed well, plot is good and the movie has a nice high quality sheen to it. There's been a string of child abduction, molestation cases in Korea and there have been movies addressing that issue. This movie is satisfying. The action is one of the best I've seen since ""Bittersweet Life"". Definitely worth watching."
2,got rid of my broadleaf weeds,Got rid of all the wild strawberry and violet that had taken over my lawn and provided a nice base for planting grass seed.
2,"Not very factual, but extremely FUNNY!!!","Rocketman was an awesome movie that you can watch 2,000,000 times and not get tired of!"
2,Music from Deadliest Catch,"Some good music, but not everything you hear on the show. Worth the purchase however."
2,Gripping story,"Victor Hugo is brilliant in his portrayal of life. His story is a wonderful classic. I was introduced to the musical first, and reading the book is such a joy. Love, loss, struggle - it's all there."
2,Great book!,"I love this series, especially the fact that many of the unique characters carry forward into each book!Angela is not having a good time! Her cheating ex-fiance left her to move to London with his new girlfriend, her strange parents have just moved back to town and she has to argue a case against annoying (but gorgeous) John Franco. John isn't having a swell time either. His grandmother keeps getting arrested, his family is mad at him for representing clients who are fighting against his own family and he has to argue a case against annoying (but gorgeous) Angela DeNero.Needless to say, sparks fly, in all kind of ways! Don't know how many times I've woken my husband when laughing out loud through these books! I lend all the books of this series to friends and we pass them around. They always come back dog-eared and this won't be any exception! Millie Criswell has done it again!"
2,An overview for the new woodlot owner,"This book provides a good background for the subject of woodland management for both timber and enjoyment, blending the two subjects well. It does not provide much in the way of specifics, as the subject is too broad, and often recommends professional help rather than suggesting ways of helping yourself (i.e. further reading)."
2,Ages Review,"The first thing about this game is don't get a player's guide. It will be too easy. Try and get the other Oracle game, so you can get cool stuff like the Master Sword and the Mirror Shield. Not as good as Ocarina of Time but certainly up there. Although the last boss is easy there certainly are hard puzzles. It has a unique bunch of characters including Dimitri, the swimming Dodongo, Ricky the boxing Kangaroo and Moosh the flying Bear. It also has some sweet weapons like the Cane of Somaria, the Seed Shooter and the Switch Hook. Most importanly it's defiantly worth it's price."
2,Works very good . . . for the moment,"For years I used a Wahl clipper for home use. I usually bought a mid-priced model ($40 to $60) and was generally happy. However, the last Wahl clipper I bought did not hold up well and became useless within a year. After reading many reviews, I decided to try the Oster (paid $55 for it). So far I like it. I have used it for about 2 months, cutting 3 heads of hair every 2 to 3 weeks. It cuts very smooth and, contrary to some of the reviews, does not vibrate much at all, and is fairly quiet. I use it on thick hair and it plows right through. It seems to me that it has more power than the last Wahl I had. On the down side, this clipper gets hot to hold after about 10 minutes. I am not a professional so I take my time on a cut, running the clipper about 15 minutes. Many reviews said the clipper stays cool, but I am not finding that true with mine. This worries me for the long-term use for this clipper - only time will tell."
2,Ok piece.,"I like this piece well enough, but I'm only going to give it a 4 out of 5 because off the picture. The picture doesn't reveal that the pendant's sides stick out about a centimeter or so. The visual effect is somewhat unpleasent and the picture they show doesn't reveal this spect of the pendant at all. Still, it was ok."
2,Jump With Big Bad Voodoo Daddy!,"Big Bad Voodoo Daddy are not of pioneers of Neo-Swing, but they made it big. When I first heard that album I was impressed. I like Scotty Morris vocal and jumpin' arrangements. Please Baby is the only track on album that may not be one of your favourites. But album is very good."
2,A must!,"Dexter Gordon was one of the great tenor players and leaders, and this is probably his best album. The warmth and richness of his tone and his invigoratingly live rhythmic sense made all the cuts on this session outstanding, but on ""Soy Califa"" he outdid himself, with Billy Higgins and his great cymbal work matching him every step of the exhilarating way. Dexter told the truth here--he was ""Califa""!"
2,My Mama done told me....to bring this DVD home !!,"What a great, great collection. Bringing back the memories. You remember the lines.....you probaly even remember the characters, try these:....My mama done told me to bring something for dinner......My Little killer, go out and get a rabbit, or something...Ah, nope, nope nope, nope, Ah, ah-ah, nope, nope, nope,nope........(How many Lumps?). Ohh, threee-orr-fourrr .......Monsters are such INteresting people.......I say, I SAY, boy, Listen up when I'm talkin to ya....The great classics of all time, backed up with a full symphony orchestra !! Greats such as Mel Blanc(Voice), Carl Stalling (Music), Chuck Jones, Friz Freeling (directors), etc. You just don't get that with todays cartoons. Also, you can't beat the animation. Sure, Pixar in the movies is great. But have you watched saturday TV cartoons lately? 'Ol bugs and company blows 'em away.Treat your kids to the best, you'll enjoy it too."
2,Simple & Clean,Nice design. Easy to set up. Great price. Go get this if u like to play emulators on your comp.
2,Biggest surprise of the year (at least so far...),"Having seen these guys live, I really wasn't expecting too much from this album, though I know their studio work is far more polished and coherent than their shows might lead you to believe. They seem to have been permanently tagged by one track that's now five years old, Fahrenheit Fair Enough. Which was what caught my ear the first time I heard them. Just a one-track pony?Nope.Remixes Compiled is a streamlined sonic surprise. Many of the tracks are vocal, the musical styles of the tracks are wide-ranging, yet the whole album feels totally cohesive, glued together with clicks, blips, and glitches. There's such immense detail in every track-- layers of sounds, sweeping and fading in and out, beautifully timed, always fascinating. It's like listening to imagination.I'm sold."
2,A Bit Corny But.....,"I loved this show when it was on TV and when I found it on DVD, I just had to have it. I love the humour in it. I also like the actors...Bruce Campbell and Kelly Rutherford, both of whom have moved on to bigger and better shows. Bruce Campbell is now in Burn Notice and his acting has just improved more and more over the years.Anyhow, although it might be a bit on the corny side, it does have some humour in it, too, and is worth watching.....once, maybe twice...."
2,Blazing Angels,"Two major revelations; my kids enjoy this so much they miss meals, I found out how motion sick I can get. Not a good day when your wife cooks dinner!"
2,Pricey Replacement,"The carafe does the job, but is expensive for what it is. The glass could be sturdier. I had to replace the original carafe because it cracked after being set down too hard on a granite counter."
2,Good,"For those of you who've read Jim Morrison's poetry and gagged like me (and I'm actually a big Morrison fan), you might expect the same tripe from McCartney. Morrison was a bigger student of poetry, but Paul's the better Poet. Granted, Paul has had more decades to his life to read and write poetry, which cetainly is relevant. But Paul's actually a decent poet. I just read a line of Paul's ""The critics don't like this poetry."" I haven't read any of the criticism. But I think it's decent poetry. Yes, in a perfect world you'd be buying a volume of a starving young (or old) poet, instead of this one. But, if you're going to blow money on a celebrity vanity project, you could do worse than BLACKBIRD singing."
2,The DVD we've all been waiting for is worth the wait.,"This DVD is produced by NESN, and as a result it has coverage of the entire, incredible 2004 championship season of the Boston Red Sox through to the World Series sweep over the Cardinals. Minus extras, it runs 80 minutes. I wish there was more detail but it certainly hits all the high points of the season, and in fact begins the story with the crushing defeat in the 2003 ALCS. It concentrates for obvious reasons on the 2004 games against the Yankees, and because of that minimizes some other great games and performances. There are some good interview snippets with Terry Francona, Curt Schilling, Jason Varitek and all the key members of the Red Sox executive staff. The extras are moderately interesting, and although the background music is only ok, at least it's not annoying."
2,This is the book I've been looking for...,"The selection of quality men's fasion books generally leaves something to be desired. I looked for quite some time, and picked up a couple books at the local library. I came across this book one day by chance at a Barnes and Noble, in the bargain section no less! This was exactly the book I was trying to find. Classic men's fasion, grooming, lifestyle tidbits, it's all there."
2,Big fan,I am a big fan of Taylor Swift. She is such a great inspiration to the younger generation. She has found fame but is still down to earth. I love the fact that you can see two vidoes when you play this CD in a computer DVD player. All the songs on this CD are destined to be top singles and Taylor is a great song writer as well.
2,A surprising gem,I havent been an Ultravox fan but I bought this after revisiting them via Live Aid. This is one of those serendipitous discoveries you make when you take a risk.It is just a really great concert. Midge sings with great emotional expression and the music is really full-bodied and up to date - even those older hits he covers really well. His words are poetic and reminiscent to me of David Grey.It is well filmed and there is really not a weak song on it.It also has one of the strongest starts I've seen to a concert.I am now won over and will be keeping an eye on him in future.He is also someone who would appeal to a wide range of agegroups.This is a 'Wow' rating from me.
2,Pure Eye Candy,"with full length photos, detail shots, and eye popping color. In addition to clothing, the book is full of accessories such as shoes, belts, jewelry, and handbags."
2,Hi,You getto battle 10 different characters in a great game. You can modify your deck and battle your friends with the link cable. I think it is just a fun game.
2,"""Shut the f**k up Donnie""","This movie was recomended to me by of all people my father. He said its a good stoner movie. Well right off the bat I was committed to seeing it so I went out and bought it. The first viewing of the movie I was confused and wonderinf if in fact I mean well.... um if I liked it man, Then I watched it a second and third time... It started slowley growing on me man, My fourth and fifth viewing of the movie well ... umm... like I had been smokin some Tie stick man.... and like it was just far out especially the Halusination scenes. With every viewing I have picked up stuff that I had not noticed in previous viewings man, like everytime you watch it you will too. The movie will definitly grow on you man, so grab a white russian man, and just go and pop in the movie man, and pretty soon you will be calling your self ""THE DUDE"" you will be saying ""SHUT THE F**K DONNIE"" etc. One of the true Stoner movies glad I saw the movie, I highly recommend it man."
2,"Mouse is excellent, keyboard design is a bit messy","Well, the logitech wireless mouse and keyboard is realy cool. the black color is eye catchy and the mouse sensitivity is excellent. the keyboard is very good too, with a lot of controls, but i would have preferred keys with softer touch and a better design to rest my hadds. u can do away with the extra wrist rest though, and then it works fine."
2,Something a little different.,"This British double CD set has a mixture of Christmas songs from America & England. Most date from the 30's & 40's, with a few that are earlier than that. You'll hear some of the usual, popular songs from that era including Bing Crosby, Judy Garland, and Nat King Cole. What's really fun about this collection is everything else! Lot's of oddities/rarities that you'll most likely not find anywhere else. So if you like vintage Christmas songs and are looking for something different to listen too, then definately check out this CD. My only complaint is the sound quality is somewhat uneven throughout."
2,Excellent book on the nature of the inferior functions,"This book explains the nature of the eight functions in their inferior roles when they're exerting an uncharacteristic influence on a person. It briefly summarizes the nature of the functions when they're in the dominant role for purposes of contrast, but that's not the focus of the book. This is to my knowledge the definitive book on the nature of the inferior functions, and together with Lenore Thomson's ""Personality Type"" which deals with functions in their dominant role, it covers the most important aspects of personality theory. If you're new to personality theory, I recommend reading Lenore Thomson's book before this one. They're both roughly the same quality (excellent), but knowing the nature of the inferior functions isn't as urgent as knowing the nature of the dominant functions. These two books are a must read for anyone interested in personality theory. Naomi L. Quenk (the author) is INFP. I am INTP."
2,Simply The Best.,"Fellow Musicians and Educators,GET THIS!! I have NEVER seen and heard anything like Pat Petrillo'sLearn How to Read Rhythm's Better!!IT IS #1 in my studio and I'm positive many more for getting drum studentsto do something many are a tad intimidated by: READING CHARTS!!If this had been out in 1999 when I attended Music College(Now McNally Smith)my reading teacher would've given me an A and not a C.Utilizing this WILL WORK for readers on ALL levels.Way to Go, Pat !!!Sincerely,Marc D.White(Marco')"
2,"Uncomplicated, exactly as advertised","My wife wanted this for very simple tasks in her Thai restaurant. She opened the box, wiped/washed the vessel clean, dumped in some garlic and fresh chilis, and hit Play. It worked like a charm, and is still doing it a month later, heavy-duty, even though it is not specifically rated for such commercial work. It is precisely what she wanted, and does exactly the task it says it does. There are no drawbacks, actually, but I give 4 out of 5 because - be careful washing this little baby, the blades (surprise!) are sharp."
2,"Excellent content, however a board book","This book is excellent in content, however it is a boardbook, which was not in the description. I bought it to use with a group of preschoolers, which was kind of hard to do because the pictures are so small, it being a boardbook, not a picture book for sharing with a class. The content is appropriate for preschool, and the primary grades and is EXCELLENT."
2,Great resource.,"If you haven't read this and you are a health practioner or just someone interested about living a more healthy lifestyle then you should read this. It has cured so many different diseases and it just once again proves how much nutrition and our diet really shape the way our health will go. Great read, great recipies, good overall buy!"
2,The Dreamer,"This is truly a story of love, commiment, heartache, and triumph. It tells of a man's dream to to build his own rocketship to go into space and orbit the earth. He accomplished this with love of his family depite government interference, and the prospect of foreclosure on his land. Totally wonderful movie to see over and over again."
2,On of Patrick's best works.,"Wow! What a powerful statement this CD makes. The dark overtones, smooth movement,and relaxing but stimulating synth textures, can get you lost in a world only limited by your imagination and the quality of your headphones. A must-have for any newage electronic music lover."
2,One to think about....,"This movie starts with an engaging whodunit and in the last 30 mins or so turns into a moral question I still don't honestly know what the right anwser is, yet the film gives both sides equal time. Very good film that deserves a look and it will stick with you long after the end."
2,Great shoe,"I really like this shoe, especially since it comes in a wide width which is difficult to find in a quality shoe. They are very comfortable and stylish. Only suggestion that would make it more comfortable for me would be to have a less pointed toe."
2,Excellent,"An excellent textbook of medicine. Covers both basic and clinical. Could be difficult for beginners but absolutetly interesting for doctors and senior students. I look at it as bridge between (Davidson, Kumar) in one hand and (Harrisons, Cecil Textbooks of medicine) on the other hand."
2,Easy work,Assembly was not difficult even for an old codger like me. Operation is smooth and appears to be equal to the very expensive units at the local Spa. Both my wife and I are pleased with the unit which is performing exactly as we expected.
2,EXERCISE FOR ALL!,"I have found Leslie Sansone's videos make a difference in my life! It can be at beginner level, intermediate, or super body builder level, they have done exactly that....made a difference in my life!"
2,The usual ...,"The story is a run of the mill extra-marital affair. Stunningly beautiful Zoe (Barbara Mori) is married to a wealthy businessman and they suffer from a bored marriage. The vulnerable Zoe falls for her husband's younger (playboyish) brother who is an abstract painter/artist and they enter into a short-lived promiscuous relationship. However, very soon Zoe gets pregnant and her promiscuous lover suddenly loses interest and calls for an abortion. Zoe's husband (who has inclinations towards being gay) redeems the ailing relationship by accepting the yet unborn kid as his own.Nothing special about the movie, except for the stunning presence of Barbara Mori. If you remove her from the movie, then the rating drops to a single star."
2,jimmy roselli neapolitan songs,"I you like Jimmy Roselli you will love this cd. It's sung in Neapolitan dialect. the quality of cd is not the best. first few seconds of the best song, anema e core, is missing."
2,This CD is TIGHT!!,"Eve is the best new female hip-hop artist to hit the scene since Lauryn Hill went solo. Eve has the flow, the beats and the originality to become a major player in this rap game. If you like fresh lyrics with original beats (only one sampled cut) and a CD that will be impossible for you to sit down and listen to, you want EVE!"
2,Great Workout Partner,"This vacuum has a lot of power for being so small. The noise level is akin to a baby crying on an airplane, so wear some noise cancelling headphones or some earplugs while you clean. The vacuum does a remarkable job of picking up small particles, dust, and even larger/heavier items on the floor. It has many attachments, many of which I don't use, but as for the one pictured (the long extension arm with the roller head in the front) it rolls/sucks great! I have 900 sq. ft. of wood flooring in my apartment which I clean about once a week and I haven't had an issue with this product since I purchased it 6 months ago. You will work up a sweat, however, while you clean since it's manual. This vacuum uses a bag, and it's very easy to pull out and install a new one. I highly recommend this item for it's utility, but I'm downgrading one star based on the noise factor."
2,Straight Up Old School Wu,This CD passed the test at a party last night. Straight up old school Wu hits you from the start of this and doesn't let go of you.Track 8 shook things up and track 14 kept us goin.This one is worth the $15.Hook it up.
2,a good book,has some very helpfull tips i would recommend this book for anyone who is doing their own home or just starting out
2,Provocative yet Entertaining,"Although there are many facets of this book worth mentioning, I feel that Hofstadter's analysis of the evolution of the Agrarian myth to be most interesting.Also, Hofstadter's ""The Age of Reform"" is (in my opinion) extremely broad and philosophical in context. Written in 1955, this Pulitzer Prize winning work traces the development of Populism and the beginnings of Progressivism from the 1890's to the rise of WWI. However, this book is in my opinion ""primarily a study of political thinking and of political moods"" and, therefore, suffers from a major weaknesses. Put simply Hofstadter's book is largely devoid of primary regional sources, and his work pays lip service to the crucial values and strategies of key Populist leaders. I recommend Lawrence Goodwyn's account over Hofstadter for this reason...otherwise, a well written and intellectual achievement...worth a look."

2,You'll never forget it if you went to go see it!,I went to go see this play in New York when it was previewing! I couldn't belive it that it was back on broadway after sixteen years. We were walking around New York and I looked down one of the streets and I screamed with joy! I never saw this show in my whole in tire life. I listened to the new cast and it was amazing. The show is amazing as well. I'll never forget it! Mr. Cerveris is just amazing as the demon barber and Mrs.LuPone is just amazing as him. They were so great I wanted to leave my seat and go and give them a big huge Hug...but that will be a big problem! This was once in a life time for me! I will want to go see this show again and again as I did with Phantom. Sweeney Todd will give you chills after you saw it. Don't forget to go see it. Sweeney Told me to tell you get your cd today.
2,Best Photo Paper,I found this to be the highest quality photo paper at the best price out there. It beats more costly paper hands down and you get 100 sheets instead of 20 for the same price. How great is that! Works great with my Epson printer.
2,Big Fun,"This is a massive, fun book, but it's not very condusive for travel. It's also frustrating that they don't tell you which puzzles are ""Mondays"" vs. ""Saturdays."" I like to do crosswords while I travel, so I ended up ripping out some pages and carrying them with me. It may be better to get a smaller book."
2,Up is the best,Up is the best! Bought it as a gift who loves the movie and he was thrilled to see it in 3D
2,Making it cool to be a Christian!,"DC Talk's ""Jesus Freak"" is probably one of the most influential albums to come out of Christian music. By crossing over and reaching out to audiences who haven't been blessed by Christian music, ""Jesus Freak"" mixes hip-hop, pop and alternative flavors to bring us an album that makes it cool to be Christian or better yet a ""Jesus Freak."" Perhaps one of the best reasons to buy this album is for their rendition of Charlie Peacock's ""In the Light."" It sure to have you singing along at the top of your lungs. An added bonus - Charlie joins the guys on the end of the song. This is a great album to buy for any teen struggling with their relationship wtih God or those who need to know God. The music alone with capture them and the lyrics will change them."
2,Great for morning and evening prayers!,This book of psalms is a great addition to any prayer time. Music is also easy and understandable!It's definitely worth it...
2,Mastering the Secrets of Yoga Flow,"A+ for Dougs new book, ""Mastering the Secrets of Yoga Flow."" This book is a great book for any Yogi. I love the way Doug flows in and out of asanas. And in this book, he shows you how. He also has alot of information on diet and nutrition, which many yoga books don't. His book is filled with so much information. I am co-director of Seaside Yoga, and I strongly recommend this book to all of our students that come to our studio. It has something for everybody and for every level."
2,Worth watching,Very interesting documentary. The story is clearly remarkable but the amount of planning that had to occur was even more amazing. Gives you chills seeing the footage of him on the wire between the two buildings.
2,Interesting and Intelligent Look at Being Lost in the Woods!,"This book exemplifies King's ability to thoroughly develop and interact with his characters. By the end of the book, King had brought me to the point where I really cared about what became of Trisha. The story was not as exciting or imaginative as some of Stephen King's other tales, but the book was still very entertaining considering it was 90% monologue. I definitely recommend this book to anyone looking for a great character novella (also it is easy and entertaining reading for the beach or poolside)."
2,Nice recording. Doris in good voice but sappy arrangements,"This is a nice recording of standards by Doris Day, who is still in very top vocal form, even though this was her last recording. The arrangements are a bit sappy and the energy a little droopy, something that seems to happen whenever Day is allowed to the slow the temp and indulge herself in ultra-soft warbling. What really bothered me about this recording which was sold by a flagship seller and fulfilled by Amazon is that I received a copy marked ""Promotional only - Not For Sale"". Clearly this was a promotional album and Amazon should not allow a promotional copy to be sold on their website. It's just wrong."
2,The Incredible Walking Dead,"Here's the thing: this show is amazing. To say anything less means you are a terrorist. And Americans hate terrorists. Are you an American? Or a terrorist? The acting is superb, the drama is exhilarating, and the suspense is so thick it can be cut with a knife and served with Thanksgiving dinner. I can't think of a better TV show at this point. Waiting the two days to get this in my mailbox was two days too long. We really need to develop teleportation devices so when you buy this award winning, face melting, life altering show, it can immediately pop itself into your DVD player and play itself. Why are you still reading this review? Buy it now! Only you can prevent the zombie apocalypse."
2,Masterpiece!,"Man this game is great!I would recommend this game to anyone!This game has it all. If your a shooter they have 9 different guns! Including the classic stormtruper gun,the disrupter rifle (for all you snipers),Rocket launcher, and even the Wookie bowcaster. If your a demelition man they got trip mines,Thermal detinators (granades), and detonation packs.You just wanna go hack some baddies just whip out your lightsaber. They have awesome force powers that add strategy to the game like pull, lightning, and even grip (strangle). They have a fun single player game as well as a fun multiplayer game.Sojust to sum it up (for thoose lazy people) a great game to play if your a star wars fanatic or just a let me just hack kind of guy"
2,It just gets better while you listen,"About 35 years ago I made my first pilgrimage to Chicago in part to hook up with my first love and more importantly to hear the blues up close and personal. I tried to hear Arvella on Maxwell Street, but despite what it said in The Reader, he wasn't playing that one day I had set aside to try and catch him. Although the first love petered out, the true love is still there, and I recently came across this cd. Admittedly after the first track made me think that I had stumbled onto the wrong Blind Arvella Gray, the cd just picked up from there--the songs get more bluesy, the slide work more gutsy, and the experience made me glad that this lifetime gave me enough days to finally hear Arvella sing."
2,Linda's good as usual,I love stories that flow into each other - this really does it. Linda Howard knows how to keep true to old characters while bringing you along into new wonderful characters. She sizzles!
2,Wonderfully Informative,This book offers great insight to the reasons behind the symptoms that are experienced when going through the change. Wonderful nutritional information as well as supplements that asssit in alleviating some or most of the symtoms. This is a must read for all women!
2,"cars, trucks & trains",My son just turned 3 years old and is obsessed with trucks and construction equipment. This cd is like a dream-come-true for him. I would highly recommend it for any children interested in construction equipment.
2,Dragon Tales Original Television Soundtrack,"It's about time that a cd for children is made in the style that adults could enjoy as well. The music is hip-hopping, hip swinging & fingers snapping rockin tunes. The music makes you want to get up and dance!!!!!"
2,A Great Adventure,"The best part of this fantastic work, in my view, is the dialogue. Truly, this might be Moore's greatest effort at creating believable interactions between characters. I especially liked how he does this at the beginning of the story. The illustration work also is incredible, and leaves a reader fully in the world of the United Kingdom at its peak."
2,Just what I needed,I needed the camo shirt for a race. It came in the time frame it said and fit fine. It was affordable.
2,a must have,"I collect and read photography books. This one I got as a Christmas present, and it's super. Whether you're into celebrities or just great photography, this book covers it all. I also like his reasoning and history behind some of the people he photographed. A great book to have in any collection."
2,A light and amusing Hamish MacBeth,"The eighteenth book in the Hamish Macbeth series was not so much a mystery but a compilation of several little mysteries in the daily routine of Hamish Macbeth. It was a good book for light reading as Hamish is very likeable character.While Hamish solves these little mysteries, such as the husband batterer and the nursing home scandal, but his attention keeps getting drawn back to the village of Stoyre where strange happenings are occurring to the townpeople. Is this village truly haunted, or is it something else more sinister? It is up to Hamish, but not so much as to draw attention to his heroics - because then he might get promoted.Hamish wants to stay in Lochdubh with his dog, Lugs. He definitely does not want to be promoted in any way.How he does solve the mystery of Stoyre, and how he gets non-promoted makes for a delightful book for all Hamish MacBeth. A great light read!"
2,Quality product,"This device was surprisingly easy to set up and we use it every day, effectively. The signal easily goes through two walls. The only downside is that there is some periodic interference. It seems to be coming from a neighboring unit in our apartment building. This has still been much easier and cheaper than having a cable technician come and install more wall jacks or running long cables everywhere!"
2,Great for South Beach Dieters,This book gives a great explanantion of Glycemic ndex and helps you understand why it is important to eat low on the glycemic index. The pecan crusted chicken recipe is absolutely wonderful my whole family enjoyed it. If you are on the south beach diet make sure that you read the nutritional calues carefully. Not all of these recipes will work for the South Beach diet.
2,Maxilos and Spinax,"Maxilos and Spinax is a good set. I like Spinax because he is very poseable. Maxilos is tall and sometimes he wobbles back and forth because of the way his feet were built. His waist bends, an improvement in BIONICLE."
2,Awesome!,"Hi,I am a chiropractor. I carry this book in my lending library and have had them taken out dozens of time. the response form my patients is phenomenal. Coconut oil is truly a miracle, and this book ONLY BEGINS to reveal it.82 year old patient after a month of using it - ""My hands look 20 years younger!""68 year old patient - "" My blood sugar is under control for the first time.I don't know if everyone would achieve these results, but so far, I am impressed!"
2,The US is missing out!,"I'm not sure which of the Parachute Band's albums this actually is, their New Zealand releases are You Alone, Always and Forever, Adore, and Love. I presume its the most recent one. Anyway, they're all good and have changed the shape of praise and worship in NZ over the last 3 or 4 years. Their songs are real and honest."
2,Possibly the best modern Party Movie of All-Time,"I'm a total film nut and have seen just about every movie out there. I saw The Boys & Girls Guide to Getting Down several months ago at a special screening in Hollywood...It totally blew me away. Raw, hillarious, true to the lifestyle. One of the best party films ever. Brilliantly directed and shot, some great unknown actors, and a clever narration vehicle to move the story forward at an upbeat pace. It's like I was watching a collection of the funniest stories from my nightlife experiences in LA. And honestly, for those green newbies to the LA scene...Very informative. Almost educational. You will probably never see this film in a major theatre, but great gem for the personal DVD collection. I'm def putting it on in the background next time we have a rager.As an indie filmmaker myself, this is the kind of film that keeps me inspired.Glad you guys finally got this bad boy to DVD.Good Luck with the Film."
2,Review of A Gypsy Lady to Die For,"Zane M. Smith has created a book that the reader cannot put down until the last page has been devoured. I picked the book up to read on a plane trip and after I started reading, I never looked up to eat, drink or use the restroom. I felt like I would miss something if I stopped . The story is an intense detective fiction, and Smith has created some memorable characters with his vivid and witty descriptions. The plot is twisted and keeps you guessing until the last page. This is one book that ended too soon!!! I strongly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys action, humor, suspense and mystery. This book has it all and then some."
2,"Not as good as T2, but close!","This is one fun movie with plenty of action to boot. After 12 years away, you gotta hand it to Arnold: he still looks great for his age (in his 50's now!). Although the movie, like Matrix Reloaded, is extremely fatalistic (our destiny is unchangeable), it makes for a great popcorn flick nonetheless. Arnold's performance this time out, however, is lacking something that I could not quite put my finger on. Perhaps it was James Cameron's direction, who knows? In any event, it's one movie that I'll probably buy when it's out on DVD. Gotta have the complete trilogy, you know."
2,Great volleyball,Great ball I've used it in a pretty competitive setting for about a month and it is proving to be awesome.
2,Young Spock's story is more interesting than Pike's,"Certainly one of the most impressive TOS episodes is the 2-part ""The Menagerie."" I can't say that I was terribly intrigued by Captain Christopher Pike in that episode (he was basically James T. Kirk all over again), but when I learned that this book fleshed out young Spock's backstory, I decided to give it a read. I wasn't disappointed. Vulcan's Glory shows a side of Spock that is both plausible and surprising, mainly because it focuses on his very complicated love life. The mystery surrounding the gemstone is almost as interesting as the love story. Christopher Pike still didn't do much to set himself apart from Kirk, but I did enjoy reading about his first mate: Number One, a woman bred to genetic perfection.As for the physical book, I found the font to be of a very generous size, bigger than most paperbacks. My eyes were not strained in the least, and I found it an easy, enjoyable read."
2,A Must,"This box contains all of Artur Schnabel's Schubert recordings. Schnabel's reputation for intellectuality and musical integrity sometimes leads listeners to expect a kind of joyless Teutonic paragon when they hear him; in these Schubert records, to the contrary, one hears immense joy in the music, rhythmic freedom, insouciance, ecstasy. One of the great things about this box is the sound quality. Schnabel created a bell-like sound at the instrument, a lyrical, and to my ears, deeply affecting sound that is often lost in modern remastering. Not here. Some of Schnabel's pupils felt that his Schubert playing was even greater than his legendary Beethoven. Don't miss this opportunity to discover if they were right."
2,First Single off Warnings/Promises,"This is great song and a great opener for the forthcoming album Warnings/Promises. Fans in the US will have to wait until August before it released in the States, so imports are all we have. The album is already out in the UK. I have have listened to the album for a month already and it is fantastic. The album is already one of the best of 2005."
2,The best!,"I bought this CD the day it came out and I listened to it and one word came to mind: WOW! Not only is she better as an ex-Spice, she looks better as well. For once, we get to hear her real, true self."
2,"it was, my wish","Hi, I cannot to spellit to easyly in my poor English, I need to write so much, but I like this radio, but, it is not to good."
2,This was better,I like this one because it has a great deal of affection and just more affection. I do think this one is one of her more better novel. This had a hero that i rather liked and the girl was alright....in this book it was fun seeing how the main characters played off each other. So I do recommend this one.
2,The best mixing bowl!,"I bought this bowl 2 weeks ago and have used it numerous times. It's great! It doesn't slip across the counter when you are mixing stuff by hand, and is very easy to grip with the rubber on the side. The spout on the side also comes in handy when pouring stuff into pans for baking. The design of this bowl is very ergonomic. I highly recommend it!"
2,A very stimulating book with superb illustrations.,This story was so good it inspired us to write our own Winnie adventures. The story was fun and made you feel warm and cosy at the end. The illustrations were fantastic - a cartoon witch that was not too scary! Every time we read it we saw something new.
2,What Makes a Classic Classic,"The starkness of the black and white film photography adds to the mood and captures the essence of life in the mining towns of Wales and the social conditions that continue to impact the lives of countless of millions on our planet even today. The strength and integrity of the characters add a realism we no longer find in contemporary film with all of its superficialities which unfortunately reflect much of what passes for relationships in the current milieu. The character actors take over this film because it is a film and not just a ""movie"". The moral tone and message is not overbearing and the deeply spiritual character of the Welsh people is exempliefied in their ""chapel"" and their local choir which was the contribution Methodism made to the life of the people of Wales."
2,A superior product.,"When I picked up The Fall of Reach, I expected a fairly amateurish attempt to make a prequel to Halo. I was pleasantly surprised. Eric Nylund obviously put a lot of thought into the thing, and it shows. The book is a believable and knowledgable, staying close to the story of Halo while adding in interesting background information."
2,Towering Epic on the potential of Mankind,"Not a small task to attempt, the reading of this tale is a must for everyone. The depth of detail makes the impossible seem actual - have you ever considered how the ecosystem of a waterless world works? The characters are bold sketches of heroic ideals as in the great works of the ancient Greek tragedians, but with the insecurities of 20th century life as we all know it. It is the tremendous and complete effort that Herbert put into the creation of an entire society of the future that ultimately gives this book its value and appeal - from religion to recreation, we are taken on a fascinating journey into an fantastical yet paradoxically realistic future. Not one for you 'blaster and quick thrills' fans."
2,live is good,"I just went to ""Reggae in the Park"" in San Francisco, and to hear them live it is something else. A great band with great musicians..."
2,Amazing,"Really makes you think a great book for everyday man going through hard times. In time like this, this book can really open your eyes wide to alot of things."
2,MY 17MO. OLD LOVES THIS DVD,"I will make this short and sweet.My daughter is 17months old and knows numbers 1-10. She had found this DVD in its case about a week ago and wanted to watch it. So i let her of course....and from that DVD and practicing with me she now knows her numbers, 1-10.Great DVD. Buy, watch and reflect on it with your lil ones! ;)"
2,Beautiful Book,"This is a beautiful book with lots of nice, colourful pictures of the Nepal Himalayas. Almost every single trek that I know of, from Humla, Mustang to Dolpo, Manaslu, Dhaulagiri Circuit and Kachenjunga is mentioned. Even the trekking peaks are covered. Of course, the usual areas like Everest, Annapurna and Langtang are also covered.Every trek that is being described comes with a box telling you the duration, access, highest point, trek style (whether camping is required), restrictions/permits and sidetrips. In between the treks, there are also information on Nepalese culture and traditions.However, if you think that all this is too much for a small, glossy book like this, then you're right. I find the info on some treks quite sketchy. You'll probably need additional references if you're going into a restricted area. Another problem is that this book looks more like coffeetable book than a rugged reference to be brought into the outdoors. I would hesitate to bring it on my trips."
2,Why is this not on DVD???,"Another movie that is only available on Instant instead of DVD. It's very frustrating.What about all those people who love to watch movies on the big screen TV instead of a tiny computer screen and who want a DVD that they can watch more than once?Please make a DVD from ""Fraeulein""!!!"
2,Life is too short for hate,"Hate... Hate and love are the two most powerful emotions in the world. The two of these emotions can be taken too extremes, and when they do, very powerful events can happen. In American History X, the feeling of hate is overwhelming. Derrick radiates this hate to all that surrounds him. He holds this rage inside, and lets it consume his life. He is so blinded by his hate that he does not take the time to see all sides of the story. The death of his father just seemed to justify thoughts that were already implanted in his head. American History X, shows this powerful emotion of hate like no other movie has been able to do. The reality and no nonsense presentation of the movie are what touches each person so deeply. To capture the essence of hate is a very powerful thing. The movie was able to capture the idea that hate can take over and run your life. You become blind to what you are actually doing, and become desensitized to all other human emotions."
2,BEST book ever!!!!!,"This is the best book ever. I couldn't put the book down. I finished it in 3 days. When I was reading it, I was imagining what Wes would looked like. I pictured him as Trent Ford the guy from How to Deal. Then I searched How to Deal and I didn't know this, but Sarah Dessen also wrote that book, which later became a movie. I was so mad when the book ended, I wanted to read more. I hope she is writing a ""The Truth about Forever 2"""
2,all time favorite,"This is my favorite Christmas CD. The choir is amazing, the trumpet is inspiring, the song choices are really cool. There's a mix of traditional American and some English songs that I hadn't know and have really come to love."
2,AT&T EP590-3 Accessory Handset,"I like this phone because, if you have internet phone service this phone is a good one to use."
2,We are loving this new Cannon Power Shot,"This new camera is very easy to use, even my three year old is enjoy taking pictures with this camera. I would recommend this one to anyone who is new to digital cameras. Aside from the fact the it is user friendly it also takes great pictures.I am very pleased with the Cannon all around."
2,Great movie,"I really enjoy this movie because it illustrates the stupidity and tragedy of war, and brings home the message that when we take away the propaganda and hatred, we find we have more in common than we have to fight about."
2,"A Note from the Future: WOW, BEEEAUUTIFUL!!","This CD IS the beauty of DnB. If you like the atmospheric side and the positive vibe of DnB this CD should have been in your collection yesterday. I really can't say enough about it. From the first track on DJ DB takes you on the famed ""journey"" that most mixed CDs strive for but don't reach.On a ranting note: I can't understand why more DnB like this doesn't own the proverbial airwaves. How has DnB strayed so far into the Dark Side? The apocolypse has already happened...a new and beautiful day is already dawning...so let it go already and embrace a positive future.--ModelCitizen"
2,Great reference,Very detailed. Great reference for grocery shopping. It is interesting to learn about all the science that goes into product marketing.
2,Sinatra darkest moment,Indeed a suicide album but a must for those that need to know Frank and his dark side.
2,One of the Best Folk-Soft Rock albums ever!,"Neil Young has made a lot of classic rock albums through the years: Everyone Knows This is Nowhere, On the Beach, Tonight's the Night, Rust Never Sleeps, Sleeps With Angels, etc.But I don't think Neil has ever made an album as beautiful as After the Gold Rush. ""Tell Me Why"" has gorgeous vocal harmonies and an achingly lovely lead vocal from Neil. That last statement is also true of the title track and ""Only Love Can Break Your Heart.""And this album also contains one of Neil Young's best extended rockers to balance out all of the mellow songs that dominate this cd (Southern Man).There is also a cover of ""Oh, Lonesome Me"" and a tender ""I Believe in You."" The tempp picks up with ""When You Dance You can Really Love,: and the cd concludes with a song reminiscent of the Band (Cripple Creek Ferry).This is a short, but sweet Neil Young cd. It is worth your dollars."
2,cheesemaking,I am so psyched to make cheese! The instructions are clear and easy to follow and the entire book is so appealing.
2,Great movie,"This was a lot better than I thought it would be. While I didn't like Kristen Stewart, like usual, I thought everyone else did an amazing job. Charlize Theron was AMAZING! Not many people could have pulled off such a psychotic character so well. It was so believable. Also, I loved the story. It wasn't just your basic Snow White tale. It went further. Plus, the dwarfs were adorable and heroic.The only thing I didn't like was **SPOILER** in the end, you don't know who she chooses! I have a feeling it was the Prince, because he's a Prince, but it definitely should have been the Huntsman. Also, I didn't feel much love from Stewart in this movie. She didn't do a very convincing job with either the Prince or Huntsman.Anyway, I would recommend it :)"
2,sly....no one else like him,gotta love stallone...I got this after watching the new Judge Dredd and this one is wayyyy much better than the new one.
2,Punk Fun,"First started playing this game years ago. It is still a very fun game of Cyber-Future where life is cheap and Corporations rule. If you have never tried it, you should. If you have ever watched Bladerunner or the Bubblegum Crisis anime and enjoyed, you will like this game."
2,This is THE best book,Oh my gosh. I just finished this book and it was so good. I loved it. I would reccomend it to anyone who likes to go see romantic comedies at the movies. It's so good. I couldn't put it down and it only took me 2 days to read it. I hope that everyone else who reads this will emjoy it as much as I did.
2,Great Stuff!,"Got rid of my strep throat!!!!!!!!! I took it in a capsule full strength every 3 hours for 5 days. That's it, didn't need to do my regular anti-biotic."
2,Great value for dollar,Exceptional quality. Can't ask for more for only a little over 20 bucks. Quailty product and very classy looking. Would highly recommend!
2,Perfect even after the 20th time.,"I wish I could give this 100 stars. Even after watching this numerous times, I laugh and cry every single time. The performances are flawless, the story is heartbreaking and at the same time, uplifting. A beautiful story beautifully acted by everyone in it."
2,Great sound for compactness,"Having used studio over-ear headphones for years, I was skeptical that these in-ear earphones could do the trick. After experimenting and finding the right sized buds to use to get a good ""seal"" in the ear, these earphones delivered superb sound. The best part is because they're compact, you can sleep with them on, walk around without looking ""geeky,"" and easily just chill. The downside of in ear earphones is that you can't chew, hum, and sometimes breath without hearing yourself - loudly. (It's just like putting your fingers in your ears and humming.)Haven't tried in a noisy environment like an airplane, but they definitely seal out the sound! If you have the extra change, I'd definitely recommend these if you're serious about music."
2,A Bold and Unique First Novel,"UNDO THE DEED is a bold and unique first novel. Even more importantly, it is a true resource for sufferers of domestic abuse of all ages. Although the storyline is rooted in many hallmarks of science fiction, I believe it is more properly appreciated when approached as a contemporary fantasy. Not to imply that the story is in any way wispy or easy, as it is anything but that. AMJ deals unflinchingly with the abusive episodes, and in the resulting emotional turmoil that all the characters feel. I would also particularly recommend this book for young readers - the teen and young adult, whom I think would find a particularly empathetic connection to the lead characters and the teenage centered storyline, and would be most likely to derive and apply the important messages this book has to offer."
2,"Fantastic, simplistic way of teaching.","This book has captured the perfect method to teach someone the C programming language. Many beginner books are very fluffy, others much to advanced. This book explains everything you need to know in a very simple, and extremely thorough manner. An excellect purchase."
2,used 2x -does good job,we replaced a rival brand that was not easy to clean. this one so far has sliced well and is easier to clean.
2,great light,"This light worked very well for a few weeks. It works well now except every few minutes it goes dull, and I have to hit it against my hand a few times to bring it back to full brightness. Great price though!!! I'd recommend it."
2,A necessity for young eaters...,"This book is great to start your children to a lifetime of good eating. My list of toddler foods was limited and they wouldn't eat much of what I gave them. This book changed all that. They like most everything in it and I know that they are eating healthy, tasty dishes. At first it can seem like you are cooking all the time, but most recipes can be frozen for later use. You will be surprised at what your child will eat! I recommended this book to my pediatrician who thinks it's great. I couldn't get along without it."
2,Comprehensive up to date map,"I've used several Costa Rica maps over the last few years and found this one to be extremely user friendly and up to date. Not only is it a good map it also has legends to indicate key tourist activities--zip lines, wildlife, etc."
2,I've enjoyed it!,"Don't know what all the complaining is about. I've had mine about a year and have never had a problem with it. Maybe I'm just lucky-but it's still fully functional, including the cd player."
2,A very good story,"I recommend this story because it's funny, touching and meaningful. I'm very glad that I read this and I bought a copy for my family to read too. I don't read young adult literature often, but I'm glad that I read about Sal, Phoebe and the whole cast of interesting characters. Huzza Huzza!"
2,Absolutely Worth It!,"I loved this show when I first saw it on Comedy Central, Me and all of my friends used to gather in expection of a new series of AbFab. Then Comedy Central seemed to run it 24/7 and into the ground. But, I thought, I hadn't seen it in a while, and I have a gift certificate, sooooo.Everyone should run right out and get this right now; the transfer is great, as usual, the DVD version shows far more detail, (if you have a laptop, look at it on it, the screen is small, but shows far more detail) and the extras are fun. A great show, and I am glad that Ms. Saunders has decided on a new series. That will give Ms. Lumley less time to do her weird travel show shown on Ovation, and give us more of the adventures of Pats and Eddy, who have all of the binges we'd rather not live through, but love to watch."
2,GREAT,THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT AND THE TIME VS QUALLITY EXPEDITION WAS EXCELLENT. I RECOMMEND IT TO EVERYONE WHO IS LOOKING FOR
2,Hard To Find,"Never thought it possible to find this outrageous Don King (that was probably redundant).flick . If one has great memories of those times to relive and is not ""language sensitive"",go for it!"
2,Qucik read for wet weekend,"Aldor quests from one exacting branch of magic to another; with the rewards he earned always going to others. Finally, only the branch of Wizardry remains - the great, almost lost art of controlling demons. Adventure and supernatural escapade in a fantasy setting, good for a quick read over a wet weekend."
2,Please change the description,"I bought this Bible based on the description provided. It is not hard cover and it does not have Christ's words in red. Please change so someone else doesn't get the wrong bible. Otherwise, I'm sure it's a great bible. Thanks."
2,Easy to install,"I was a little nervous installing my own rear light. But is was very easy. Product came quickly, instructions not enclosed, but also not needed."
2,It serves its purpose.,"I bought this to hang up a vinyl window curtain in the shower. It serves it purpose; I don't love it because, well, it is a pressure rod. It is sturdy and easy to use and for that it gets 4 stars."
2,Loved Painted Picture,"I absolutely loved this book, not only did it capture the life of a heroic young woman a little before my time but it also told the story of so many young women in the world today. Alicia left home a girl but definately returned a woman, with knowledge and a story to help others. I have told many about this book. I read this book months ago but picked it up again and could not put it down. It was even better the second time around. I look forward to Sheila Peele-Millers follow up book.."
2,A handy edition for the Sanskritist,"This book gives the Sanskrit text in Devanagari (without transliteration) of 1700 shloka or couplets from the Yoga Vasistha, followed by rather literal English translations that should help clear up any difficulties readers of the Sanskrit may be having.A disturbing phenomenon has been occurring recently at Amazon with many sellers asking crazily inflated prices for books that are by no means rare, are still in print, and can be found at normal prices if you check around a little.The present book, for example, is in print and can be found along with many other reasonably-priced Indian titles at various online Indian booksellers.For other editions of the Yoga Vasistha more suited to the general reader see my Listmania list. It's a great book that you don't want to miss!"
2,An oldie...,"Surprised to see this still listed on Amazon. It's an oldie, but still a goodie. MP3 players are so cheap now that we have half a dozen around the house, one superseding another as prices drop and functions increase. Knock on wood, I've never had a problem with mine. It's always worked and the quality has been good."
2,"This is a good Cd, What I would expect from a Ruff Ryder!","Well The Lox returns with some smash hits on their new album, We Are The Streets. I think that this Cd is better than their first release. When I first heard the Lox on Dmx I didn't really like them, but after listening to their Cd it turns out that they are a really talented group. I think that you will really like this Cd if you're a big Ruff Ryders fan. The best songs on ""We Are The Streets"" are 2,3,5,9,15, and 18."
2,alfred eisenstaedt photographer,very good video of a all together person and photographer.Very inspiring about his life.Good coverage about candid type photography.
2,"Stunning, I'm telling you","Side ways or straight forward? Muted or florescent? Crockpot simmered, or raw from the crisper?If you chose the former in each pair, not only are you right, but you will love this subtle, simmering addictive cd. They have a gift for complexity, and layering of sounds and meaning, and it does not get old. A little dark maybe, but you are getting used to that, after all."
2,Basic communication,I wanted a basic phone that would allow me to have phone service during a power outage. I find my self using it a lot because all I need is a phone jack no electrical outlet needed.
2,Memoir,Matha Beck's second memoir. Has her unique style. She's very conflicted about her family and religion of origin and was very brave to publish this. Should shine a light to others with similar circumstances.
2,Decent product,"This is the second one of these I've owned. The first one leaked gas out of the carb, not sure what the problem was. The second one worked fine. I dislike the ""spring assist"" pull mechanism. It has a weird feeling to it, and eliminates the quicker ""snap-pull"" that helps two strokes start up when it's really cold. I don't agree with the other complaints I've read. Control placement is fine and everything is quite accessible, even with one hand. The 10-1 mulcher works decently, and I don't think I would want the bag to be too much bigger. It would be nice to have more capacity, but weight would get to be a factor. It is loud, but I wear headphones that double as earplugs, so I'm not bothered by this. My only complaint is the zipper on the bag. Gave up before the end of the first season.Even still, if it blew up today, I'd probably buy the same one tomorrow."
2,Perfection,So far I've only been using it to record movies off the television and it's worked perfectly. I even recorded a pay per view and the quality was great. No coasters here! I'd reccomend these to anyone and I'll be back for more when I finish what I purchased.
2,Don't miss this very special book,"As a 17 female I have read this tantalizing book a number of times. Basically the other reviews say it all, how magical this book is, how inspiring, and just plain special. I just wanted to add one thing however, and that is that this book is not only just for girls, my father read it and loved it, and so did my brother. Certain scenes like when Francie goes fishing with her father are drop dead hilarious. This book is a must read for all, old and young, female and male."
2,Logitech Speakers,They work great - use them all the time. GREAT speakers for the money. I definitely recommend them.
2,A must for all Modesty fans,Great fun. The interviews and introductions by Peter O'Donnell are worth the price alone.
2,Christmas present,"My daughter said she liked it, Very pretty and mine did look like the picture. I did think the price was a little high."
2,Is the defector telling the truth?,"Stone heads a secret intelligence organization operated by the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Its function is to infiltrate Russia if the need to do so ever arises. So far, it hasn't. But when Stone debriefs a Russian defector who has offered information about Russia's position at upcoming arms reduction negotiations, he questions the defector's authenticity. Stone infiltrates Russia and impersonates a KGB officer to find the truth, enlisting the help of a prostitute and a Stalin look-alike.The Debriefing is tightly plotted, Littell's writing style is crisp, and although the characterization is one-dimensional, the story is fun. It isn't as good as his first book,The Defection of A. J. Lewinter, nor is it as enjoyable as my favorite (so far) of the Littell books,The Sisters, but this brief novel is one that fans of espionage fiction should enjoy."
2,Enjoying the series,"I read book 11 first before I knew about this one. I am so glad I read it. It was like going back in time and getting to know the characters from the very beginning. My heart went out to Ian & his wife as the struggle through a tough time in their marriage. I also got to know Grace better and how she came to own Buttercup.I also cheered for Justine when she finally followed her heart, and how Oliva and Jake met and fell in love. I defiantely recommend these books for those who like light romances."
2,Great Author,"Mariah Stewart is one of the best authors on the market today. This final installment of the ""Truth"" series was a good read that I found hard to put down.My only problem was that I thought the culprit was a bit obvious due to one scene early in the book where they didn't seem to fit.Other than that, there was a great cast of characters and it was a good wrapup to the ""mini-series."""
2,Wonderful,"This introduced a new generation to the Transformers and honored the Inner Child in many Adults.The Autobots and Dicepticons were alive, smart and individual. Bumble-Bee and Jazz were excellent comic relief.Iron-hide was a warrior. Optimus Prime a leader and a warrior. Megatron a tyrant. Star-Scream an ambitious fool.The battles were vivid and intense, emotionally and physically - for transformers and humans.This gave Megan and Shia their careers. The audience experienced the transformers through their eyes,and the chemistry between them was irresistible.This movie was wonderful."
2,It's about time,"What can I say about one of the greatest heavy metal CDs I've ever bought. Zakk if you see this I want to tell you to keep up the good work, because The Blessed Hellride kick serious butt with a capital B. Bleed Black Label Society. Long live the SDMFers!!"
2,"Praise for ""Special Delivery""","This is a deluxe album with everything a jazz lover could desire. With ear-teasing arrangements and limb-shaking solos, ""Special Delivery"" is one that surely cannot be overlooked. Maynard Ferguson, Hilton Ruiz and other masters of the trade are at their very best here. Both ""On Green Dolphin Street"" and ""Autumn in Rome"" are gems. Two thumbs up! Five Stars! Ten trumpets!"
2,Great bell biking on busy trails,I use this bell for mountain biking on busy trails and it does job. The magnetic silencer works good and you can set it block all the noise or just make it sound less intruding by positioning the magnetic strip differently.
2,It's great,Sherlock is a great modernization of the classic Sherlock Holmes genre. The acting is superb and they story lines are captivating.
2,"Good, but the manga is even better.",Fantastic movie that suffers from adapting an incomplete story in progress.Gorgeous visuals and animation. Music like nothing else. A must see for fans of anime and animation in general.
2,It's like sun and shadows,"OK. I've heard better versions of the 1812 overture. This is slightly different because it has choruses where other versions doesn't have them. (Just for making you know, the best 1812 is by the Chicago orchestra, conducted by Sir Georg Solti. The label is Decca). But, the Wellington's Victory really kicks butt! You really feel in the battlefield, surrounded by guns, cavalry and infantry in the infamous battle were Napoleon was utterly defeated. Altough Beethoven despised this work, is one of his best orchestral compositions. If you like warlike music, this is for you."
2,great,Movie was fantastic and my daughter loved it to :) I'm almost more excited to see the new ones they are having come out.
2,Definitely a blast.,"Chief Brian Skelley is supervising a bomb search and diffusion training exchange exercise in Scotland when a strange relic is discovered. One that explodes and sends Skelley man back in time to 1301, the time of William Wallace's rebellion. Caira Mackenzie is struggling to keep her secret (both her husband and her father are now dead and Castle Kilbeinn is without a laird) from the nearby British. Can the recently discovered Skelley help or hinder Caira? A Blast to the Past is brisk, breezy fun, with the adventure aspects getting just as much attention as the romantic story. All in all a short and satisfying read. Recommended."
2,A film you will see again and again,"BACK STREET is one of those films one wants to see over and over. It is good melodrama and Susan Hayward is, as usual, superb in it. As other viewers, I keep waiting for it to appear beatifully restored in DVD format. When will this dream come true???"
2,It's about time!,"A great satire of Victorian England and most especially Victorian era Hollywood movies. Lots of laughs in most unusual settings. Who would have guessed Bismark would make such a comic subject? Hard to imagine why this has taken so long to make it to DVD. The only thing too disappointing about this movie is that it was the only one done to date from the immortal Flashman series, certainly Flashman in Afghanistan would be very timely and on target today, but at least the author Fraser and the director teamed up again on the Three Musketeer movies. I'll be happy to challenge to a duel anyone who dares to question my devotion to the books as long as they allow my friend to load the pistols."
2,Chuck Berry at His Best,What Memories. I've purchased Chuck Berry CD's in the past and was disappointed. Not this time. Excellent selection of hits and high quality sound. Add volume 2 and you've got all you'll ever need.
2,One Of My All Time Favorites,"One of my all time favorite bands, and one of my all time favorite albums. Gravity Kills kills all other industrial bands out there. Truly classic stuff."
2,Totally opens your knowledge to new Horizon's,It will change your point of view on how to finish your models forever. It made a 100% improvement on my painting and finishing skills. It gave me courage to try new techniques withoout fear or remorse in doing so. Every page is full of interesting content. A pleasure to reffer to again and again.
2,Great toy!,"This purse and items seemed to be really cheap online, but I wanted my daughter to have her own purse and felt that even if it was junk to me, she would love it. She loves the purse and everything in it. She plays with the phone just as much as her Vtech phone. The debit card and wallet are sooo cute. I love the material of the bag, it has a leathery feel to it. The toys are also a better quality than I thought. I would buy this again as a gift for other little girls. She also walks around applying and reapplying her plastic lipstick. I don't know where she gets that from. :) The big plus for me is that she now constantly turns over her own bag and replaces the items instead of mine."
2,I have Celiac Disease,I am three weeks into the diet and am hopeful this is my ticket to renew my health. I am four years past diagnosis and am faithfully gluten and dairy free and still have big digestive issues. I do feel different on this diet and will continue it for a year.
2,Works as expected,Easy hookup works great and no problems. Price was very good. Why would you pay more for the same cable else where.
2,Raffaella Carra Import,"I think this CD is very interest, and I would like to view the list of the tracks. Thank you"
2,Take me far away from the mucky muck,"I have seen the future...its name is ""Tenacious D"".I'm embarrassed that I payed only $14.00 for this DVD.I wish I could give more money to JB and KG after watching this awesome DVD. I watched the entire DVD in one day. At the beginning of the day, I was wearing socks. They were immediately rocked off. The concert...awesome. The videos...awesome. The extras... awesome. Buy this DVD immediately."
2,Great music,I love the diversity of Faith Hill's sound on this CD. She always makes music for any mood and her songs make me want to sing along!
2,A really great book,"""Under the Apple Tree"" by Lilian Harry is a really great book. The book starts out in 1941 Portmounts with the Taylor family being bombed out of there home. Family moves to April Grove, where they become invovled with the war effort. This is a great book, as with other by Ms. Harry the reader feels that they are in the action and the reader is able to feel the emotions of the characters. This book does use characters from other books by Ms. Harry, but does not required the reader to know these character whole story. ""Under the Apple Tree"" is a great book"
2,Great Story,"I'm hooked. The story is great, if drawn out in some spots. You feel you really know the characters after the first book! My biggest problem with book two, on my Kindle, is the number of publishing errors per page! Wish Amazon had worked to resolve those errors, made the reading just a little aggravating."
2,Startech 6ft Premium USB 2.0 Ab High Speed Certified Device Cable,Most Excellent product for the good low price! Get it at Amazon.com and save money. No need to purchase the same product at a HIGHER price at a big name store; USB Printer Cable.
2,My Son Loves It!,I bought this clock for my son's 5th birthday! He loves being able to tell me what time it is!
2,Great Ice Crusher,"This Ice Crusher works very well. The machine, itself, is quiet.. only the actual crushing makes some noise. The crushed pieces are a bit larger than I expected (not fine at all like sno-cone ice, which I didn't want anyway). This is the type of ice you'd see at a restaurant buffet with the cold salmon sitting on it). It's great if you like to chew ice. I make double-strength sugae-free drink mix (I use raspberry lemonaid),freeze it into cubes, and crush them. I pour it into a tall glass and eat it with a spoon. It's become a favorite treat in our house... great for losing weight if you're on a diet, but probably not so great for the teeth. It's easy to clean by just pouring a couple of glasses of warm or hot water through the feed tube. then dumping out the tray.The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that occasionally a very large cube gets stuck. I've always managed to get it going again by stopping and restarting the machine a few times, and maybe giving it a little tilt."
2,Works great!,The only problem is the save and loading time is slower than a nomal card.Games than already have slow saving time will be increased.This card is good sports and racing lovers.Its' take a while to fill up this card.Buy it now!
2,Served the purpose,Made by check-engine light stop (due to fuel vapor emissions from the tank) and saved me a few tens of dollars I would have spent if I went to a shop.
2,"A decent overview, good for people switching from non-Visual","Sometimes too many details, sometimes not enough, but overall a good balance. And the methodology of walking all the way through one project works."
2,Brilliant,"This is one of my all time favorite albums Its so mellow and relaxing and I have a copy in work (restaurant) that I play a lot and the customers love it and always ask me who it is. I highly recommend it,"
2,Just awesome!,"I am so impresed by the art work that this company provides for their PBN kits. Beautifully drawn and professional, this view of a sunset cabin really gives you a feeling of peace. This is a paint-by-number that is actually worth your time to complete. When you're done, you've really got something worthwhile.If you are looking for something to do to reduce stress, or know a friend who wants to try his hand at painting, Sunset Cabin Paintworks is a super one to start with.Have fun! ('Cause that's what it's all about!)"
2,A loving and thoughtful portrait of an uncommon artist,I feel better for watching this video about the life and work of this wonderful artist. I'm envious of the director that she got to know this graceful and independent woman whose work and spirit I think will inspire you as much as it has inspired me.
2,Great basic laptop.,"I purchased the Laptop from a local Best Buy about a year ago. Since then I have had absolutely zero problems. If you're looking for an inexpensive laptop for basic stuff, this more than fits the bill. I mostly use it for audio/video playback, audio/video conversion and overall web surfing and basic MS Office.The battery life is average at best (with WiFi turned off and screen dimmed). It should also be noted that I threw in an extra 1gb of RAM. A bare minimum of 1gb is needed no matter was OS or hardware configuration your using.Overall it's a great ""beater"" laptop. This thing has taken so many hits / drops and has always bounced back (literally)."
2,wow...just wow,wow!!!!!!!!! this album is sooooooo cooooollll!!!1seriously i must say that iam the biggest fan around for the killers they are sooo rad an hot!!!!!they are wykd.and i think that brandon flowers has a great voicewords cannot describe how cool this is!!!!just buy it u will love it to bits.trust me
2,Get it for free,"Good companion to Stop The Clocks CD set. Don't spend 11.99 for the EP, it's included free with CD purchase of Stop The Clocks at Best Buy. Don't know how long the EP will be available as a free addition, so hurry! Get it at Best Buy for free!"
2,Feel good movie,I had heard great things about this movie and had never seen it. Good movie...very old time but good.
2,Excellent Study Guide,Read the book for two weeks straight. Passed the exam with no problem. This is a must get for anyone looking to get A+ Certification.
2,Another Catwoman?,"Chloe King is a girl with cat-like powers (sounds familiar???) that also includes having 9 lives. As part of an ancient European species called The Mai, she is now a target of an organization called The Order of the Tenth Blade, out to destroy the Mais. Good pacing, but the cat woman idea has already been played out. Not the best super power books for teens, but alright. For those who like super power teen books like Buffy, this is recommended along with Queen B Superheroine and Fearless."
2,Indispensable travel companion,"I spend a lot on time on the road, and it is always a pleasure to plug in the i-Station so I can enjoy the music in my hotel rooms. The sound is amazing for the size and price, although it does hit its limits at higher volumes. It can use more lower frequency response, to play the notes in the lowest octave. Also limited by the size is the stereo imaging. If only the speakers can be separated.I bought another one for my 85 year-old mother, sent along with my older iPod, to use as a jukebox. I think this is a great application for someone in her situation, because she would not need to fumble with all the CD's. What would be great improvement would be a screen that shows the display in larger type, so an older person, (including myself) can read the information without putting his nose on the iStation. Or better still, buttons to control the iPod while plugged in."
2,"My 4 year old loves these, and is learning from them","My boy can't get enough of these magic school bus books. They are cleverly written with layers of detail, allowing you to make it a long read or a quicker read. I couldn't ask for a better way to make him look forward to kindergarten (although he will be disappointed when they don't have magical adventures!) And as a PhD scientist and former science teacher, I have not yet found an error in a dozen books. For the sticklers, they even debunk the pretend parts of the story at the end. This electricity one is great, and the senses one is superb (but long). My only quibble is that with the paperbacks, the pages soon fall right out. But they're good enough to tape em all back up!"
2,"Good novel, strong woman!","A disclaimer: I'm a *VERY* critcal reader and I'm a feminist.Now that that's been stated, let's get on with the review.Good romance novel. I love the cover. I love that the heroine is a strong, warrior who can hold her own. My only problem with the novel is that she (again, A WARRIOR) goes ""to the kitchens!!!"" Ugh!Still, the love story is strong. The characters have depth and are well-developed. The author certainly took the time to research the time period...always a plus."
2,star wars radio drama review,This is an outstanding audiobook...it is in an audiobook form and so that what i call it however the special effects the sounding of blasters and the musical score take it way beyond any audiobook....It's worth the money and i would consider other radiodramas because of this oneStar Wars: The Original Radio Drama
2,Very Nice,"Great collection, great packaging! First movie just has English subs, but the other two have the option for English dubbing (which isn't bad, but the voices just don't fit the profile).I would recommend reading the books before watching the movie so you have a good idea of the dialog and what's going on.Can't wait for the English version of The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo with Daniel Craig (Dec 2011?)."
2,Great Game,SEt is a great game that is fun for kids and adults alike. I like it because you can play it with turns or you can play it by who sees the set first. I think this is a great educational tool because it uses both sides of the brain. I like to take it when we travel.
2,The best socks for your young one,"I love these socks. Yes, they're adorable, but more importantly they stayed on my infant's feet during the winter months. I've since given these socks to all my mom-to-be friends."
2,A Classic with a Lasting Message,"I liked this book because, even though it is a historical classic, its relevance spans decades. Perhaps its a bit eccentric in its view of the future, but none in that genre would be readable without an element of exasperated disbelief. I enjoyed the book, but I would recommend 1984 or Animal Farm, for their similar messages, before I would recommend this book."
2,My favorite flavor,"Perfect size for work. Just fill with water, stick it in the microwave for 1 minute, and enjoy. Has bits of apples in it, which makes it yummy. The maple flavor is my 2nd favorite, but a bit to sweet for my taste. The cinammon roll flavor is bringing up the rear. This is probably about the size of 2 regular instant oatmeal packets. Fills me up and it's good. Order a case and you'll be set for a couple of months!"
2,wow,this music may sound boring at first..but the lyrics are so cool..and very peaceful..and they have great voices..and right when i heard it i fell in love this music..wow.wow.wowbuy this cd!!!
2,Excellent Filters,"I've put K&N filters in every car I have owned, and always notice a different in throttle response and horsepower. Love them."
2,Proceed with extreme caution,"So you're a Poppy Z. Brite fan? Read Drawing Blood? Read Wormwood? Read Lost Souls? Consider yourself able to handle anything she could possible deal out? Think again. Do not read this book just because you loved her other work, and certainly don't read it if you've never read her other works. There are things in this book that you can never un-read; she makes you feel things you can never forget. Granted, all you hardcore fans out there won't head this warning- I certainly wouldn't have. So do go right ahead, and when you are done you will know what I'm refering to. All of which is not to say that this is not an incredible book- as always, Poppy Z. Brite is the master of descriptions so vivid that they make you feel, smell, or taste her words. And that is what makes this book so profoundly disturbing and so utterly unforgettable."
2,Has worked 100% of the time for 3 years,"I've had this pedometer for 3 years now and it has always worked, despite the many times I have dropped it on the ground. I wear it every day, almost all the time and it still works well whether it's in my bag, in my pocket, or clipped to my belt. I would definitely buy this again or buy it for someone else as a gift."
2,Great jeans,"Great fit on these jeans. True to the style of ""slim"" and not ""skinny"". And hang comfortably on the waist without feeling like they're falling off. Sometimes I think I'll buy another brand of jeans but always come back to Levi's."
2,Well done,"I have been a fan for years, and was pleasantly surprised by this documentary.To see how many other rock musicians were influenced by Rush was surprising."
2,Very nice,"This shirt looks even better than the photo. It is a high quality shirt, and gets a lot of comments. I would recommend it to any fan."
2,Great camera,"Excellent camera, highly recommended. Only 4 chilis because it would be nice if they made the same with a larger display. I'm saying the same, not one with lesser optics like the SD200/SD300. I've taken almost 8000 pictures with it, very good."
2,The Punisher!!,"ummm I dont know why you guys are saying ""the punisher gets barely hit""....well if you watched the movie you'll know why. Second, I have played this game with my freind and its really great. The graphics are actually awsome, especially game play. The best thing to do is go RENT it and decide on your own if you like it or not. Everyone has different opionions. I give it 4.5 stars our of 5."
2,meets expectations,The cable does what its supposed to do. I ordered this after reading CNET review which said that this is no different than its expensive gold plated counterparts (monster cable etc.) Loved the price and it delivers.
2,The most effitiant book of blair witch ever!,"This book is a great book. It is perfect for blair witch fans.It has evidence, journals, happening, a timeline, goverment papers, a picture of the blair witch and much, much more!"
2,Cave of Forgotten Dreams,"Beautiful photography and very interesting narration literally illuminating the lifestyles of 30,000 years ago.I found it very touching and uncanny that the people enjoyed art and music as we do today. The idea of creating art and music while struggling with survival is truly an amazing human trait,"
2,"Good value, works great.","The first thing I noticed about this shaver is that it weighs half of the 10 year old rechargable Norelco 300SX it replaced, due to it not having batteries inside. Also, this shaver is much quieter and is less irritating to my sensitive skin than the old shaver."
2,Good product,Got by recommendation of acupuncturist for my husband. He hasn't used it but I have and it is a good product
2,The shining rocks!!!,"Excellent item ,great picture.Quality is awesome.An old classic presented the way it should be.Totally worth its money"
2,3D Connexion SpaceNavigator,I am using the SpaceNavigation to teach airspace for the Federal Aviation Administration with Google Earth. It is fantastic viewing Google Earth providing a very smooth movement during tour recording sessions.
2,New Look is Nice and Easy to Use,Wow what an upgrade...been using the old version for well over a decade and very happy with the new version...It took a little while to figure out how all the bells and whistles worked but well worth the investment!
2,From a grandmother,"When our two-year-old grand-daughter opened the package and found the darling ""suitcase"" of miniature books, there were squeals of delight. From all the adults who were familiar with Beatrix Potter. She, of course, doesn't yet know. But it's a fine gift to give, knowing she will find out for herself."
2,"Trujillo, and his team of sadistic sycophantic goons","Beautifully written historical novel that not only exposes the Trujillo regime (1930-1961), but also weaves in a narrative of a daughter who cannot forgive her father. You'll have to wait til the end of the book to find out why. Also included is the story of the rebels who took Trujillo out.To think that some people in the Dominican supported Trujillo is sickening. Of course, he enjoyed US support for his his ""anti-communist"" stance, all the while, brutally torturing and killing those who questioned his regime. Toward the end, the US put pressure on him because he fought with the Catholic Church."
2,this brlliant album smokes!!!!!!!!!!,quadrophenia is one among the all time best hard rock records of all time.buy it.
2,Summer Breeze Sugar and Creamer,"A great price for the set, about half of what you'd pay from the retail stores. No visual flaws in the stoneware. Beautiful set!"
2,Wonderful book,"This book is an illustrated biography of one of the most well known psychologists of the 20th century. Fromm had a varied career and his fame spread far beyond the confines of traditional psychoanalysis and sociology. This biography, written by his literary executor, Dr. Rainer Funk, outlines the life and work of Erich Fromm in a good way."
2,FROM A CHARACTOR IN THE DREYER( authorsgrandaughter),"hi, i am Krystina Morant (NO LIE) i would like to give would like to take my tweety bird hat off to you, because u have written 3 books without drama or anything. i would also like to say keep up the work. Aggie: WOW OMY GOODNESS 3 books. thats alot even i couldn't do it. Tick: Mr. Army guy (lol) you've done it! I would like to also say thanks for putting me in the book. I love you guys very much even if it means for me to wirte the dreyer part 2 the aftermath. lol anyways call ya gurl sometimes buh bye"
2,Perfect for Traveling,"I read a lot so when I travel I must take along several books. On my last trip I ran out of books. Someone loaned me their first gen kindle so I could read a short ebook. It was a lot more pleasant than I thought it would be. It doesnt ""feel"" like a book, but the pages do ""look"" like a book.After that experience I decided it made more sense to have 1 Kindle with several books on it than to carry multiple books and mags with me on each trip. I bought the second gen kindle and it has an even better layout than the first. I reccomend buying a kindle cover when you purchase your kindle to protect it.Although I LOVE it I gave it 4 stars because to my knowledge you cant ""share"" the books you have purchased. Which is frustrating because if you liked reading a book you'd pass it on to a friend, not tell them to go buy their own copy. Also, I get a lot of books from the library and there is no way to ""borrow"" library books on the kindle."
2,Awesome?,"This is my favorite perfume ever!!!! I am so glad to find this link, because I can't buy it in the stores anymore."
2,Chipper lawn bag,"Again, looked everywhere for a replacement bag for the chipper. This one is an exact fit so we are up running again."
2,I was expecting better...,"I love Maxwell, I really do, but this album is going way out there. WAAAAAAYY out there. He still brings the same sweet groves that make you want to melt (including whispering Spanish over an enchanting beat) but it doesn't seem to have the same energy as his previous albums. But.... I will always be a Maxwell fan. The album is good, but look for a slight change in The 'Fro to sound a bit different. Still the same sexy grooves that made you love him in The Urban Hang Suite, definately worth the dough."
2,"Love the music, the Latin flair, and the beat",This is the greatest Santana song to ever come along in my opinion. Great for dancing cha-cha to and really puts one in a Latin spirit. Not surprising that it is number 1 on the charts.Thanks Santana and Rob Thomas for all your efforts. Keep up the good music.
2,"It's an SD card, what can i say?","I bought two of these SD cards. These are very big cards, and they do just what i want them to do. I bought one for my Nikon D40, and one for my new Kodak Zi6. On my D40, on the highest settings, i can shoot 2,200 shots, and that's a hell of a lot of high-quality photographs. I do not know exactly how many hours of HD video i can get on the Zi6, because it doesn't say, but i know it has to be a lot. These are good cards, and the frustration-free packaging is great, and just that- frustration-free. You will like these cards. Just to note: owing to these being SDHC cards, you can only use them in SDHC tested electronics."
2,"The only book I have ever read twice, back to back","Bill Bryson's A short History of Nearly Everything rates as nearly the best book I have ever read. He takes complex subjects and renders them readable, understandable and highly entertaining. While I am an avid reader, I learned more from this book than I have from nearly anything else. A must read!"
2,I totally agree,ok i like both bratz and my scene dolls.why do u people even fight we are diffrent!!
2,"Uneven Storylines, Perhaps? Appealing, Maybe? Perfect Summer Fun, Absolutely!","Not sure if this show would work as well October - May. However, I start thinking about football in July. The upcoming selection video my FFL does every year, running hundreds of mock drafts, the trip to LV for the actual draft and loading up my offshore account for the first weekend of NFL.The point to my rambling tangent is that this show is first and foremost about the relationship that Dani has with a football player (""T.K"" King) and a football team. Someone once said ""life is all about timing"".What this show does well is to go behind scenes into the life of unbalanced players and their collective sense of entitlement.The show is not overly thought provoking, nor is it an adrenaline rush. What this show is-is light hearted summer fare, which happens to be broadcast during the network ""dead zone""."
2,It works.,This cable works as intended. Not much to say other than it's constructed very well and I have no doubt it will last for a very long time.
2,Hysterical !,"I recently made a trip to Britian, and caught this show while I was over there. When I got back to the States, I was quoting lines from the show constantly - (i.e. ""I'm a lady, you see"" or ""I know, I want that one""). So I decided to buy this DVD set. I hesitated about being the complete set, but I am so happy I did - hours and hours of enjoyment."
2,a pleasure to watch,"This is the film adaptation of the first novel by Sue Monk Kidd, The Secret Life of Bees. Set in 1964, this is the story of Lily Melissa Owens, who lives on a peach farm in South Carolina. At four years of age, Lily accidentally killed her mother. Her father is a harsh and cruel man, and Lily craves her mother's love. She does have the friendship of Rosaleen, a Negro servant, but when events put Rosaleen in jail and in danger of her life, Lily decides they need to escape. Lily follows the scant trail left by her mother and they end up living with the eccentric Boatwright sisters, farming honey and learning to understand the world and themselves. Queen Latifah does an excellent portrayal of August Boatwright; Lily is superbly played by Dakota Fanning, and a special mention to Paul Bettany as the troubled T. Ray and Sophie Okonedo as May Boatwright. The screenplay is mostly faithful to the book: a pleasure to watch."
2,Love it.,I just loved this book. It had me from the start. It was different from some of her books. But I loved this story. I love Diana Palmer.
2,Great Product,This is a great product and works great. Thank you for having this product on Amazon! I'm using this product for my computer. Easy to setup and use.
2,Remington heavy duty hedge trimmer,"So far works great. I recommend it for people with lots of shrubbery to trim and want to do the work themselves. Keep the cutters well oiled. It's much larger than a regular hedge trimmer. If you don't think you can handle the weight and size you shouldn't buy it. It has a feature that will keep it powered on even when your hand isn't on the trigger. That makes it more convenient, but could be more dangerous also. Overall I'm really happy I bought this tool."
2,good value,"I've owned this light for about 5 years. There is no set up time when you go to use it, just pull it out of your truck, plug it in and go. There is a convenient carrying handle built in and an outlet to plug in an additional tool. One of the best features is that it sends light in all directions so there isn't that constant repositioning that there is with most work lights. The other thing that's really great is that it doesn't produce fire hazard heat so it's both safe and cooler to work around. I wouldn't say that it's indestructible, but I've been very satisfied with this light."
2,Best sim ever,I started off about 3 years ago playing silent hunter and it blew me away it was so good. On silent hunter the graphics were pretty bad but the gameplay was amazing. Silent hunter 2 has fixed all the problems of silent hunter. This game is amazing the gameplay is great and the missions are pretty hard so it wont take 2 dyas to beat. I have been playing about 2-5 times a week now for 2 months and i am not bored of it. The graphics in silent hunter 2 are better than silent hunter but are still not amazing but even with that the game is awsome. The missions range from recon to sinking enemy troop transports. I always enjoy playing the game. To sum it up: amazing game with better graphics than silent hunter.
2,Funny absent-minded romance.,"I'm a big fan of Laura Kinsale's romances, but not all of them. This one is on my winner column. Midsummer Moon made me laugh on several occasions. It was almost like watching a Lucy/Ricky ""I love Lucy"" where the heroine, Merlin, is absent minded and not aware of her dangers to her circumstance but pursues her passion of creating a flying machine with utmost diligence, while the hero, Ransom, who is trying to do right with her, can't help but be terrified and appalled by her antics. But, he is unrepentedly devious and works to curb her ""nutty-professor"" pursuits and tie her to him instead.Then there's the hedgehog who is unforgettable in his own right.Midsummer Moon is a fun and funny romance full of antics and a memorable cast of characters."
2,just like jurassic park,"i freakin love this thing, i was robbed and worried for my cash so i decided to get one of these because i am a jurassic park lover as well, it could be a little heavier but for the most part it is very well made and will fool most people"
2,Must See!,"If you are interested in knowing what is going on, in general, behind the curtain of our government, then you should see this movie. If you choose to be blind, then don't bother."
2,Great,"Anything to make fixing my three little girl's hair easier I'll buy! This was a good buy. Not a miracle worker, but helps for sure. The flexible bristles give when going through tangles on wet and dry hair. Nice and smooth for drying too!"
2,"Tyrone, Tyrone RIP","This was certainly one of Tyrone Davis CD'S that did not get the attention that it should have I feel it didn't. I have been listening to Tyrone Davis since I was 9-years old. He has always made great music. It is real simple, these Music artist, that I have spoke about in most of my reveiws, They will forever be very 'IMPORTANT' to me. Because I have listen to them just about all of my life, you cannot go wrong with this CD. It has a lot of great songs all through it's entirety. You will find some songs that some artist have produced, and the entire Cd or album does not have a lot of great songs. On this CD of Tyrone's it has many great songs. There is no one like Tyrone Davis. And I am so sure that many will agree with me.I miss him a great deal. Soon we will all be done with the troubles of this world. 'RIP' Tyrone."
2,GOD MADE ONLY ONE DEX ROMWEBER!,This man plays some AMAZING stuff! He is one-of-a-kind. I have been following him sence 1985 and love everything he does. Dex is Rock N Roll!
2,"David Trottier's ""The Screenwriter's Bible""","David Trottier's ""The Screenwriter's Bible"" is absolutely the best book I've ever read on this subject. He inspires you to write and tells you exactly how to do it. His advice is explicit and current, his examples well-chosen and illustrative. Thank you, Mr. Trottier! I couldn't have written my spec script without you! - V. Kneifl"
2,Just funny...,"Wonderful stuff.I first heard Sean Cullen on XM radio, who regularly play excerpts.This is simply very, very funny stuff.He is having a lot of fun with the audience, who seem to be having a ball-and you will too.The comedy can best be described as ""playful goofiness"" - with intelligence behind it.Much of the set has a very spontaneous quality which is just infectious. There are some great songs, set pieces and non-sequiturs. Mr. Cullen's mind is marvelously limber.Overall, this man is funnier than a good many of the more popular comedians out there.Highest recommendation."
2,What makes TNA better. The X division.,"O,kSo incase your new to TNA maybe you want to know why it is unique. Answer: The X division.The x division is no limits high flying AND technicly sound athletes. No wieght limits( Amazing red- 175 pound, Samoa Joe- 285) Its all about skill.And in this DVD you will see some of the greatest matches in TNA history, including several 4 star matches one or two 5 star matches and some very good ones. Not a bad match on this dvd. Trust me, its a great buy.And to the kid reviewer: Obviously you have never seen TNA because wwe is much more of a ''porno fed'' than TNA."
2,Dewalt XRP 18Volvt,This is without question the best battery drill I have ever used. I have been drilling treated 4 x 4's with 1/2 inch drills and the battery has the best use time I have found. The 500 foot pounds torque is great when the material is wet and there are knots to naavigate.A lot of stores sell the 18v DeWalt but not all of them have the XRP. This is a superior drill in performance and battery life. I am really sold on this product.
2,Wonderful,"I'm no expert, but I thought this book was wonderful. I started reading it because my step daughter chose it for a book read in school. I wanted to be sure she was reading it. I laughed out loud many time while reading. Thinking how many adults I knew should read this book to remember what it's like to truly believe in something. I thought it was incredible, honestly. Little Primrose goes through some really big stuff and she always has a deep sense telling her, everything will be ok. Many people are against her and think she's crazy, and again, she handles it like a champ. Personally I bought this book for people I feel need to remember that no matter what life deals you, you'll be ok. Believe in yourself and always believe in your gut instinct."
2,Great,"My naturopath recommended this to me for a leaky gut (reactions to food, slow digestion ect.) I'm really happy with it. The bumps on my arms (which I've had as long as I can remember) started to go away after just a few months. I guess this means I'm absorbing more nutrients!"
2,Changed my life!,"Now a days, you hear it everywhere...change your mind, change your life! Well, I first heard it from Seth in 1985. Personal Reality changed my worldview and caused a complete paradigm shift for me. Since then, I revisit this book often. To be honest, it was my first Kindle purchase! And why I keep my Kindle with me always!"
2,Excellent Product,"I have to say I bought this size dish after I bought some smaller Le Creuset dishes at TJ Maxx. The other reviewers are right about the clean up. I bake chicken a lot, and trying to get the burnt chicken grease and gunk off of a glass dish is very difficult. This almost wipes clean with a paper towel, and what doesn't come off with that comes off when you soak the dish in water for as little as 10 minutes. I see no reason to not buy more Le Creuset now. Just look for it at TJ Maxx first. They are much cheaper there. For some reason there have been 2 or 3 price increases here on Amazon over the last week or so. I love the Kiwi color vs. red, blue and even white."
2,Back belt,"Great sale. Was just what I needed. Would buy again, if I lose weight and need a smaller one. Thx!"
2,great for skype,works graet skype the only con is that is too big but sounds goodThe price was right and its better usb than analog
2,It Made my day.,"I saw Chris Sligh on American Idol and I immediately became a fan. When I heard he had an album dropping with his band, Half Past Forever, I knew I wanted to check it out. Well, the album did NOT disappoint!! Chris has amazing song writing abilities, not to mention vocal genius. Adam and Cole are fantastic musicians! The band operates as a single unit allowing an incredible sound to blast through the speakers. Each song on this album has a different flare, but it all falls under the same category of good rock. The lyrics are meaningful and the music is catchy. I find myself singing ""Know"" all the time, and it's not like one of those bad songs you get stuck in your head and ruins your day...It actually made my day to find myself singing the pleasing song!!Overall, ""Take a Chance on Something Beautiful"" gets 5 stars and hopefully we'll see these guys make it big! They deserve it!"
2,Perfect,"I love this ball... It's just the right size for me. And can hold me... Its probably a bit small but it makes it a bit harder for me.I agree that the plug is a bit of a hassle to get out, but if you work at it. It will come out."
2,"Hippies, Rock bands, Drugs, and Murder","The novel covers two cases, the first the murder of a young woman at an outdoor rock music event in 1969, and the second a young male writer working on a novel in 2005. As first the cases seem separate, but then links develop as Banks and his assistants investigate.The main problem I had was with the structure of the novel, i.e., a few pages in 2005, then a few in 1969, a few more in 2005, then back to 1969, etc. They are not really flashbacks, but an intermixing of the two cases that make it hard to concentrate on the plot. I finally skimmed through, ignoring 2005 until I was finished with 1969, then went back and read the 2005 sections.There are some side issues about various people's attitudes, and contrasts between time periods. Kev Templeton does not come across well in this novel; and Banks has a new supervisor, an ambitious woman who views herself as a new broom."
2,Entertaining Children's anthology,"With poems grouped winsomely into categories of animals and a great selection of works by Christina Rossetti, Lewis Carroll, Rudyard Kipling, Kenneth Grahame, Emily Dickinson, Hilaire Belloc and other notable poets, I find it a shame that this little paperback is out of print. It is wonderful for early elementary aged children, who can find many different moods and descriptions for amusement and appreciation. Dover please bring it back!"
2,Richter's Agenda,"I really liked this show, it's something that could really happen. Makes you stop and think when your playing on the computer who may be watching or tracking you."
2,Fun punk at it's very best,"""Fear of a Punk Planet"" by the Vandals is by all accounts a punk anthem and a definate classic. With funny songs and great guitar by Warren ""Mutant Boy"" Fitzgerald (whom's father is actually a rocket scientist), the Vandals pump alot of energy into this album and it shows when you listen the the fast-paced hilarious songs that the Vandals have recorded. One of their first albums, a prelude to their 5+ other albums."
2,Scary Movie - The Greatest Comedy Ever!,"Scary movie is simply in one word...hilarious. When I saw this in theaters I couldn't stop laughing. The mocking of movies such as Scream, the Matrix, I Know What You Did Last Summer, the Blair Witch Project and the Sixth Sense is incredibly funny. This is a movie horror and comedy fans cannot go without seeing!"
2,"My Favorite ""Pirate""","I have to admit, I originally went to see the Pirates of the Caribbean because I wanted to see Orlando Bloom. But when I saw that Johnny Depp appeared, his careless and casual way attracted everyone to him. He was witty and funny-looking, making me one of the millions of the fans obsessed with Johnny Depp. On the other side Orlando was an expert swordsman and later he and Johnny Depp made the perfect pirate pair. Also Orlando Bloom has wonderful love with the heroine. I have to talk some about the skeletons because they are so powerful. They got cursed from the missing coins, so they must find the coins and correct them; otherwise they would never die, so they gave lots troubles to Johnny and Orlando. So it made the story became more interesting. Formerly I never liked a role so quickly and so profoundly as Johnny Depp's role. So it's a recommended movie for anyone who likes action, humor and adventure, and it's a good entertaining movie. I hope you will enjoy it."
2,Good quality,"The pictures do not really tell what the ""Oil Rubbed Bronze"" looks like. It is a good looking semi-gloss black with a brown undertone. The manufacture of this unit is well done."
2,A gem,"Bulmer's book is deceptively simple. You start reading it thinking that it belabours the obvious. But as concept after concept sinks in, you realize that you are in the presence of a true master of the field. Every word in every sentence is there for a reason, and with care, the book becomes an amazing guide to mathematical statistics, presenting the heart of each issue without unnecessary fuss and with great elegance.I have read the book from cover to cover three times, and each time I dip into the book I learn something new. Compared to the heavy tome by Snedecor or the procedural texts intended for social science majors, this is a breath of fresh air.But beware: you have to read this book with care. Don't skip anything. Convince yourself you understand each sentence before you move on! Otherwise you will surely get lost."
2,Loved it!,"Good read .. Kellen and her friend Lee are the like the friends we all want to have,if only to live vicariously through them. They are not twenty somethings either..they are mature women.. and smart ones. Kellen trained to be a doctor, chose another path.Once upon a time she lived on a lovely horse farm with her partner Bridget. Then bad decisionson Kellen's part ended that. But the love never ended.This is a murder mystery and most of the important parts are played by good, strong and lovingwomen. The inspector is a treat, I like him. I especially liked him when he showed up with Tir, anotherstrong smart female. Some might call her a b*tch, but she wouldn't mind that a bit.How satisfying to be the one to look for the one who did harm to loved ones.The ending came too quickly. A worthy read. A series of course. I look forward tobook #2. It is no Three Pines, but I sure wouldn't mind visiting..."
2,"Yes FIVE STARS , For an action/revenge movie most definately a great pick","Great movie. From the beggining too the very end. You get attatched too each charachter. And whats better then revenge movies ? This movie will have you on the edge of your seat untill the end. Yes there was a few holes in the plot. But then again too people who got a normal head on there shoulders will realize the plot is simple. It is about 4 brothers mother being killed and they come back alltogether too find and bury the killer and go threw everyone and everything untill they catch him. Pretty simple for the people who were questioning that. But on the real subject. Great movie , Great Action , The acting was well done especially on mark whalbergs part. Like i said will have you on the edge of your seat untill the end. Well Done."
2,Great Learning Tool,"This is a fantastic tool to increase your knowledge of the blues. It includes full transcription, chord progression, and a nice write up about the details of each piece. I've never seen something presented in this way and was very pleasantly surprised with this. I have attacked this by spending a day on each song because there is a lot to digest aside from the normal pentatonic and blues scales that are typically associated with the blues. The best part to me was being able to hear how some great players approached the song and then being able to follow them with the backing track. Great!"
2,portable printer,purchased 3 of these and love them all gave for gifts two of them and the people simply love them.
2,ROCK AND ROLL BLOODBATH,"Although this record is not nearly as great as Meatloaf's magnum opus ""Bat Out of Hell II"" it still has some redeeming qualities. For instance, how can you resist the Sloan boys' off-key caterwauling in the chorus of the song ""Losing California?"" Or Jay's pip squeak girlie-man vocal stylings in ""Waiting for Slow Songs?"" This band continues to grow and conquer new musical horizons. This record is a machine gun paced tour-de-force hauntingly reminiscent of Kreator's masterpiece ""Flag of Hate."" If you're into late night, drug-induced sessions of air guitar and devil worship you'll be pleasantly surprised by these four Canadian guys with cool hair and an insatiable hunger for all out, mind-numbing, unadulterated rock carnage."
2,Great Vietnam War Story,"Regardless of your political opinions regarding the Vietnam War or any war, the sacrifice and courage of the soldiers portrayed in this epic story are honored."
2,Good book,"Well, first I have to make it clear that I didn't read or use this book. I bought this book for my daughter who is in a high school band. She said that it helped her a lot with technique and her band director once asked me if she was taking private lessons because she's very good in his opinion. As the matter of fact she doesn't take clarinet private lessons, so it does say something about the book, huh? :)"
2,Outstanding Sophomore Effort,"If you liked Brushfire Fairytales, you are sure to love Jack Johnson's second release - On and On."
2,Best Helios Overture,"I have waited many years for this recording to come out on CD. It does not disappoint. The ""Helios"" Overture is simply the best, most life-affirming version I have ever heard. This is the Chicago Symphony at the peak of its powers, all the lead chairs filled with legends. As a horn player I stand in awe of the opening horn calls, perfectly pitched with a radiant, clear tone. The two symphonies are also quite amazing, if perhaps not Nielsen. Or Nielsen on steroids, maybe. Or hearing an LP at 45 RPM (for those old enough to know what I'm talking about.) It's as if Martinon was taking the orchestra out for a test drive and pushing it for all it to its limits. It is obvious he was dealing with a Maserati, not a Yugo. The results are stunning to listen to, and well worth the small price of admission."
2,HAPPY!!!!,I LOOKED AROUND FOR A GREAT DEAL & I GOT 1 . IT WAS FAST EASY MY ORDER CAME VERY QUICK IN A FEW DAYS & IT WAS BRAND NEW I LOVED IT
2,The most creative Rock CD I've ever listened to,"With this ""Smells like Children"", Marilyn Manson has probably made one of the most inventive and new ideas bringer albums since NIN's Pretty Hate Machine, remembering a dark-sided Pink Floyd. All the ""non-musical"" sequences (which are the bigger part of the album) create a dark, heavy, dense, almost impenetrable atmosphere of pain, decay and delusion. Not recommendable for the straight-music fans, this album is a must-have for every lover of the musical experimentalism."
2,"This may be deleted as inappropriate, but until then...","At $164 minimum, I will not purchase the book. I am sure it's worth 5 stars, though.But, I strongly recommend the inspiration for it, as acknowledged by LeGuin herself: the chapter Rebellion (or Mutiny) depending on the translation, in Dostoevsky's Brothers Karamazov. This precedes the chapter ""The Grand Inquisitor."" I have both of them on my website in PDF format: http: [...]As LeGuin tells it somewhere, her title was taken from a road sign seen in a rear view mirror as she left Salem, Oregon. Thus: Omelas. My essay ""Ivan's Take on NAFTA"" is derived from Mutiny also: http: [...]"
2,New Whorf manuscripts available,"As of Summer, 2008, there are new Benjamin Lee Whorf materials available, to include articles on linguistics and an entire novel written during the trial of John T. Snopes. Also available on thisCD-ROM are articles and book-length works about Whorf.See THE BENJAMIN LEE WHORF LEGACY CD-ROM, Ed. Peter C. Rollins.It is fully described at www.petercrollins.com"
2,Double Duty Product: Best for Removing Long Last Lip Color,"I use these pads every day for effortless removal of long lasting lip color such as Cover Girl Outlast, Revlon Colorstay Overtime and Max Factor Lipfinity. The pads are very thin and are saturated with an oil-based liquid.They are also good for removing waterproof mascara, but they do leave oily residue around the eyes. For that reason, when I wear regular non-waterproof mascara, I prefer to take it off with the other formula of Almay eye makeup remover pads that are non-oily.Both of these Almay products are great for travel as they are lightweight, thin and you can put several pads in a zip-lok baggie without taking up much space at all. I've used both formulas for many years and am very happy with them."
2,Great case for my pearl!,Love the sturdiness of this case and of course the magnet that closes it to keep the phone secure. Great case for the Blackberry Pearl.
2,This bag means business,"I love this bag.It's utilitarian, rustic, and bold.Zipper is big, reliable and strong, not flimsy at all and glides along its track with easy precision. Never catches.Material is a strong canvas but it isn't scratchy or uncomfortable to handle.Interior is roomy with a rigid bottom piece that doesn't pop out or give in.The black shade is darker in person than in the picture. This is a major pro for me.It's unisex, as far as I'm concerned. Perfect for overnight visits, cosmetics, or toiletries."
2,A Must Have For Easy Gardening Help,"This is my second purchase of this book. I loaned my first one and never got it back. Great if you are new to gardening. My garden is looking better and better each year with the helpfull information. If you don't like pesticides and want to grow naturally this book is a great source of information that is easy to understand and put to use. I don't have a large space to garden in, but have managed to get a lot in a little space. It arrived fast and in good condition. The price was right and fee shipping-Yea!"
2,Great album- Great Independent artist,"This album is great. Especially considering I helped with the music!!! I really like the songs Road Rage, Johnny, Pu**y Mansion and title track.Amazing sound for an independent artist!"
2,Good But Not Top Shelf Like DA's Others,OK.I read it three times. In a row. Back to back. Each time I looked forward to picking it up. I learned a little more each time about what the heck is going on in the story.However.This book is not nearly as good as all of his others which I have reread so many times I could not even estimate how many. They are hilarious. Tea Time is good for a chuckle here and there but that is about it. I suppose those who have a bit more upstairs than I may find all the social commentary or what ever makes up for the lack of silliness and humor. In my case it did not.Glad I bought it. Glad I read it twice. Not really worth the third read. Wish it was as great as all the others. As some one once said the lack may lie with me and not the book.A great loss that there will be no more. I tip my ridiculous hat to you Mr. Adams !
2,Olga is Great,"I love this bra and I wear one daily. If you like comfort combined with beauty, then this one is for you."
2,The BFG,The book I'm writing about is called The B.F.G. The reason why I liked the book was because it was funny! It was really fun reading this book (though the teacher read it to us.)When it was an exciting part I shrieked. When it was a funny part I laughed. That was when the B.F.G said exactly to egjungkly! The book was very funny and I wanted to read it again but it was too hard for me to read by myself.
2,"Really, Really Wierd, but Somehow Prophetic.","After about 15 minutes of this movie you are confused, you ask yourself, ""should I turn this off"" but you just keep watching it. The more it went on the more I wanted to see how all these oddball characters would come together and culminate into the end of the world. My wife was disgusted and picked up her book, but I kept on watching and was glad that I did, I hate to tell her that I plan to watch it again. This is not a movie for everyone and a love of dystopia and apocalyptic vision is a prerequisite for watching this film. There were many of the old Saturday Night Live crew in the movie, the most notable is Cheri Oteri, the Rock is a poor actor, but it did not really matter in this movie. The best part, that really made this story come together was the soundtrack put together by Moby. This is destined to become a cult hit like Donnie Darko."
2,Awesome,Great Spanish book. Helpful tool for those learning spanish. (note; The words are in SPANISH ONLY there is no english translation.)
2,Great Book!,"This is a great book. I really enjoyed reading All of the Angelic, Ascended Masters and deceased family memeber encounters. This book has saved the best for last in my opinion, In the back of the book is detailed instructions on how you can connect and see your own Angels as well. I Love this book!"
2,All About friendship and Surfer Power,"This movie basically displays friendship and surfer power overcoming evil. Tyler befriends some young beach types, and falls in love with the sister of one of them, who is attacked, and the attack is atoned for heavily. Rarely do you see a film where the bad guys are the only ones to die!It's only real downfall is the lack of reasons why Tyler's family are in town, and a lack of information about his previous relationahip with them. Other than that, it's all around good."
2,"feature-rich, but a little flimsy music box.","I got it for my 2 mo old son, since i thought he was starting to get bored with the musical mobile on top of his crib. I guess he is still too young, but he didn't reach out to grab the hanging toys. He did, however, enjoy the classical music that plays for 10 long minutes. Now at 3 mo, he likes the mirror hanging at the corner of the gym, but still doesn't care much for the hanging stuff.About the only gripe i have is the flimsiness of the music box. After accidentally stepping on it, the music began to sound ""funny"" and ""synthetic"". After changing the batteries, however, the problem went away. By the way, the batteries don't last very long. I play only about 2 times (20 minutes) a day, and 3 AA batteries only lasted 1.5 week. also, when the batteries go low, the music again start to sound funny and slow.."
2,More please!,Ideal for anyone who wishes to obtain information on whole foods without arousing suspicion.
2,Amazing trills and musical thrills,"Gene Harris trills and runs his way around these amazing arrangements. The music flows and dances beautifully. I tried to use this as background music while I'm reading or studying, but it doesn't work because I keep stopping and LISTENING! Wonderful stuff."
2,works as promised,"I like the belkin pureAV cables (if you got them on sale) but the banana plugs stuck out far and made the cables bend which was going to be a problem sooner or later. These connect fine (contra the other reviewer) as long as you can get them in the right position and are not bouncing your speakers around. My speakers tend to stay put, so these do their job and help protect the cable."
2,Great pamphlet,"I have several books on this subject, but this little pamphlet beats them all. It's precise and to the point. I loved it."
2,Mediocre Video Quality,"The video quality on this 3-DVD set is at best mediocre. The film used for the transfer is flawed -- little scratches and squiggles run across the screen regularly. This is surprising, given that the film is only about 15 years old. In addition, the transfer to DVD is extremely grainy and the focus isn't particularly crisp. All of these imperfections are painlfully obvious on even a medium-sized TV screen.All that being said, this is still a fun series to watch. It's a shame it didn't last longer."
2,One of the best books I have ever read,"This book was amazing. It has the power to inspire all women, no matter who they are or who they think they are. It was uplifting because the struggles described in this book so commonly conquer people, but but they didn't conquer Delores, who seems so incredibly hopless. It certainly gave me hope! Also, I couldn't believe that a man wrote it, I had to keep looking at the picture of him on the back sleeve to make sure."
2,As good as I remembered,"I read this book years ago in school and decided to check it out again. It was as good as I remember it being! It's short, but very entertaining. I downloaded it right to my kindle and was finished with it within 2 short days."
2,Fantastic,"This game is one of the best I've played, and I'm picky. I adored the original Sims, and when this came out I bought it as soon as I could. After a little bit (okay, a lot) of hassle with upgrading my computer with memory and graphic cards and what not, I started playing, and it was way hard to stop. Everything about it is just amazing, but what really impressed me was the generations and the aging process, and also the much more detailed create-a-Sim choices. If you liked the first Sims, then you should definitely get this (although maybe only if you have a mac, since the mac version doesn't cost $123 lol)."
2,Classics,This truly is the very best of Dr. D!The scottsman and Star trekking and... well you get the idea. Buy it! you'll love it.
2,GGreat choice,I bought a pair of these before my vacation and immediately saw a dramatic ddifference in clarity between this and the inexpensive ones they replaced. I'm very pleased and will look for them again wwhen I am again in need.
2,great book,i love this book i have read it many times and it never gets old. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a good adventure book. I love the author he is such a great man and should win some awards.
2,Canon PowerShot A710,This is a nice size camera with a large view window. I am very happy with my purchase.
2,Its a fairy PRINCESS!,i like the long hair and cloe is just so cute like this!!I never liked the bratz babyz until i saw this cute one.i also like the yasmin one that has long hair.this collection is so pretty! this doll is adorable!!!!!!!!soooooooo cute
2,Nightwish Century Child,Night Wish Century Child is one of the great missing sound...which hard to find.If you are a real hard fan of Nightwish.
2,Yogi for EVERYONE regardless of creed,"It's difficult to say anything new about this masterpiece by PARAMAHANSA YOGANANDA. It's a book that EVERYONE SHOULD ATLEAST TRY TO READ. REGARDLESS OF ONE'S CREED, THIS TEXT INSPIRES THE SPIRIT AND EMBLAZENS (EVEN LIGHTENS) THE HEART. Written over one hundred years ago, this book speaks to the contemporary spiritual seeker.BUY IT! READ IT! AND FEEL YOURSELF CHANGED SOMEHOW."
2,Thank you Larry Robinson...,"Lyrical genius Rusty Cundieff's masterpiece is finally available again. I've been waiting 5 years for the re-release of this CD today, and I've not been disappointed. Full versions of all of the hit songs from Fear of a Black Hat. If you thought the bits you heard in the movie were dope, wait until you hear the whole album!"
2,Masterful,"Without a doubt, one of the best songwriters out there and this release does not dissappoint. Gorka weaves between acoustic folk and soulful rock with ease on this disc. Among the standouts are ""Good Noise"", ""Flying Red Horses"", ""Carnival Knowledge"" and ""Up Until Then"". Backup vocals provided by such notables as Mary Chapin Carpenter and Kathy Mattea. Buy this disc....you won't be disappointed."
2,One of the Top Ten Books of All Time!! A Triumph!!!,"One of the Top Ten Books of All Time!! A Triumph!!!Kershaw, eat your heart out, you are an amateur compared to Shirer.Shirer was actually there, during the rise and fall. He is not only a masterful story-teller and highly acclaimed journalist, but a witness to history. Of equal importance: He gets it right!Shirer, in this important book, explains not ony the rise and fall of Nazi Germany, but of Adolf Hitler. All other books on Hitler and Nazi Germany pale in comparison to Shirer's master work, which is truly one of the best books of all time."
2,GET YO SHINE ON,B.G. THIS CD IS TIGHT. EVERY SONG IS REAL AND THE BEATS BY MANNIE FRESH ARE HOT!!!! PICK THIS CD UP!!! NOW!!!!
2,Advanced fast yoga,"If you want this to be a real workout, and not just a performance routine, keep the pause button on your DVD handy so you can stay in the poses for a bit longer than Rodney does in this video. Otherwise, it seems to be an excellent routine in a market - advanced yoga - that it's hard to find DVDs for."
2,"Good sound, poor design","For home usage and other relatively quiet locations, this microphone is wonderful. It catches your voice perfectly; arguably better than some built in microphones.**One note of caution**The part that attaches to the cable is for thick cables, probably around 7mm or so. It fits well with large cables, but for those thin double cables (Like the one Bose uses), it will not fit. I resolved this by using the plastic housing that connects the place where the double cables seperate as the point of connection with the Zalman.Nevertheless, you don't really need it attached on the cable. I do just fine keeping it on the desk in front of me."
2,The best book I EVER recieved!!,"This book may have been ordered used, but it came in LIKE NEW!! I'm such a Kingdom Hearts fan that I cannot wait to own this whole series."
2,Great product - especially given the price,"No frills, just cheap HDMI cables that get the job done. No issues at all. I bought 3 of these for my various components and have had no problems with any of them. You'd be a fool to spend more."
2,"I Really Like The Theory Represented In This Book, BUT..........","No pun intended, BUT I have a problem with the word fart.As I teacher, we were told that was a word not to be used. I said Bort............. The book explains this subject well and when I found it at the bookstore today, everyone around me had a laugh. However, we all agreed that we'd have trouble reading it to our children and as I teacher, I would. I bought it for a gag gift for my older son.I thought it was cleverly written about a bodily function that happens to the best of us. As a matter of fact, it happened to me in the store today!!!! LOL"
2,A love epic with witty punch-lines,"Being a big fan of Prince it was an absolute must for me to see this film. I expected a slightly entertaining B-movie with an over-exposure of Prince, which was what I wanted. I was totally taken aback by the witty and clever dialogue! -I still have a quote from the film for every occasion. This is a true cult-film, which entertains, puzzles and amuses with a cute ""amore""-factor."
2,Tough Hat,"Six years ago I bought this hat model and wore it daily when on the streets, in the boonies and hacking through brush. It withstood more than thirty washings and held its shape and ScotchGuard treatment well. This is my second and should last just as well."
2,My boys sucks but this is hilarious,"I was really bored one day ,flipping through the channels and i saw King Baby,so i watched and about one second later i was ready to turn it,because it had someone associated with the show my boys,but after 2 seconds of hearing his camping bit I was a fan.He notices american stupidty and makes a carrer out of it. I hope there is more specials to come if they give Patton oswalt like 5, jim should get one million."
2,Great High Quality Case!,"I have purchased a lot of different cases over the years and most are OK. I have had some those large aluminum suitcases that are horrible they don't show your titles and the case falls apart easy. This case is solidly constructed and held 600 discs easily. The four buckles keeps everything secure and I can just open this up and go to the DVD or blu ray of my choice. The handle is solid and with wheels and the retractable handle it is perfect. I will be getting more of these soon, They are well worth the price."
2,Mark Twain Remembers,"""Mark Twain Remembers"" is one of the best books I have read in quite a while. It is entertaining, sensitive, creative and beautifully written. It is remarkable how Mr. Hauser, who is well known for his sports writing, could write a book of such delicate poetry. I loved it and I would recommend it to anyone. Bravo, Mr Hauser."
2,Extremely happy,An awesome multi functional iPod charger that fits my needs at home and on the go. Very affordable too. Very happy I chose this one to charge my iPod. Thanks so much!
2,One of the best moviies in the world,This movie is the best ever. Even though I own it and watch it all around the year I get teary eyed when the Sesame Street gang and Jim Henson show up. The is truly the best movie ever.
2,Pretty funny!,"My 4-year old son LOVES Richard Scarry books and LOVES fire fighters; so, purchasing this book was a no-brainer. It is pretty silly, but I've enjoyed reading it every night for a week! Enjoy reading it better than ""Richard Scarry's A Day at the Fire Station."" Wish they hadn't named one of the fire fighters, Squirty. Funny (and a little disturbing) that the fire fighting pigs cook hot dogs at their barbeque; I just imagine that they are turkey dogs! ;-)"
2,Great Book!,This was one of the best books I have ever read. It goes through the trials and tribulations of big city problems coming to a small town. Being from the area that the story takes place made the book even more realistic.
2,excellent self tanner,"When you want a tanning lotion that does not streak or make you ""orange"" then this product is for you. My son has been using this now for at least 8 years and continually uses it.............highly recommended ."
2,Great!,Very interesting and suspenseful. Brings a whole new twist to reality TV. Very fast-paced and keeps you wanting more. Surprising ending. Really good book.
2,Graphic SF Reader,"Oliver asks Roy to come with him on a trip to recover some things, after he finds out Catman was at his funeral. Roy is shocked when he finds out Oliver asked Shade to clean up, as his 'porn buddy', as Meltzer explains. Oliver points out Shade is immortal, and everybody else around him will eventually die.An interesting look at what a long established superhero's will might include. Brad Meltzer has again handled the transition to comics very well. Don't know how good his novels are, but he has a good thing going here, and being able to do both makes him a rare talent, and worth following.He even tracks down the truck from Hard Travelin' Heroes."
2,Excellent Product,We've used 7th Gen diapers since our son was about 4 months old - when a friend handed us the end of a size 1 package. We've tried many other brands and none work as well as these. We're committed to them and are very happy.
2,Excellent,"This is an excellent mp3 player. It has amazing sound quality. I really like the touchpad too, it makes finding songs easier. I highly recommend this product. It is better than any ipod, ill tell you that much!!"
2,Wish I had found this product earlier,"This product is great, it allows you to vacuum seal wide-mouth canning jars which are inexpensive, readily available, made in various sizes and are reusable. The device is used with the standard canning lids and is then removed so you only need one of these products. The jars are cheap enough that we do not limit vacuum sealing to long term food storage but use it for coffee and cereal as well.We found that our dried food would sometimes puncture the plastic material of the bags when sealing, which is not an issue with the jars. I have bent a couple of the lids when I put the sealer attachment on the jar, so a bit of care is helpful, but it is really easy to use and very versatile."
2,They are great!,I needed a bag for my Olympus E-300 with the lens kit. And this bag does its job quite good....they are protective and it's got few pockets around which are quite useful. I just wish if the height was lil more. With this bag I can only have both the wideangle & telephoto lens if the wideangle is fitted on to the camera(not the telephoto lens).
2,Excellent true-to-nature bird sounds ..,"I stumbled upon this CD at a ""nature store"". Based on past experience many of these so-called Nature CDs are far from genuine. I was surprised by this production put out by an outfit called North Sound. The quality is very good. The selection of bird songs is quite varied and will give you a broad spectrum of this beautiful gift of nature. I am VERY pleased that ALL the sounds on this CD are nature's music. There is no annoying instrumentation to bore you and render the work banal. The segment on Smoky (sic) Mountain Meadow is fantastic. The quality is so good that occasionally I will get a couple of birds (don't know type!), on my patio querying about! My one quibble is that the length is only 58 minutes. By the time one gets synchronized to the sounds, alas; the CD is over. All in all a great buy and well worth having."
2,An extraordinary writer's stunning first novel,"This beautifully written and haunting story is hard to describe and still do the book justice. If Ms Hepinstall doesn't win a Pulitzer for this book I would be amazed. The characters are richly depicted, the narrative is so lovingly crafted it was hard to set the book aside. I couldn't be away from it for very long. I think the people who rated this novel with less than 5 stars were taking the story too literally. There is a bigger message here than how a young woman survives a brutal attack or how a young man survives his guilt. It is about redemption and love and kindness. If they made this into a film and captured the poignancy of ""Cedar House Rules"" it would be a lovely, classic film for everyone who has a heart and a soul. Can't wait for her next novel."
2,A useful university textbook,"The 16 chapters with 30-50 pages per chapter make for an easy semester workload. The 80 exhibits include clear models, showing how the customer interacts with the brand. The inclusion of two chapters to the importance of the brand in the communications strategey and the linking of brands to each of the marketing communication tools in subsequent chapters reflects the appropiate modern approach.I would have liked to see a little more than the few pages offered on the use of interactive media but those offered did include examples of web pages and other useful visual information. As the authors rightly point out, not all communications will be interactive in the future and students must not lose sight of other forms of communications.Overall I found the short paragraphs and clear layout easy to use during lectures.A really useful textbook."
2,"Frederik Doci: soon to be a ""household word ..""","It's my privilege to know one of the songwriters who contributed to this album, so I've had a preview of Frederik Doci's amazing voice .... the question from everyone who hears this album is going to be, ""where has Frederik Doci been all this time?"" Well, he's arrived and I, along with everyone who hears ""Canterina"" will be cheering him on. Oprah, dust off the sofa!"
2,Why do people hate this album?,"I love Leonard Cohen's stark poetry. I love Phil Spector's overheated orchestral fantasias. Many negative reviews of this album lay blame for its ""failure"" at Spector's feet. True, the combination of Leonard's words and Spector's music may be unusual and even disconcerting, but for me the end result is a ragged, absurd glory. A fantastic, underrated piece of work. Don't listen to it with any preconceptions and you may appreciate it."
2,nintendo ds headset,both my kids love this and so do we.now we can drive along and not hear their games all the time. great invention!
2,Learning the past for the future,This is a wonderful book! Paul and Anne Ehrlich did it again! Everyone cares about the fate of human beings and our future generations should read it and take actions suggested by the authors.
2,A must read if you want to get better!,"I manage a car dealership, and our management team is going to have every employee in the dealership read the book and report on what they learned. It will change their thinking, just like it changed our thinking. It will change yours too. We MUST look at every transaction as a piece to a bigger picture puzzle, and this book reminds us of the the ""how's"" and ""why's.""PS. Even if you are not in the ""car business"", this book will change the way you think about interacting with people. Simply put, it makes you want to give 110% in everything you do."
2,Rastaman Steve,"Whether you love Steve Earle or whether you love reggae, this EP with The V-Roys is a can't miss. The mix places a big, booming drum beat way up front and Earle and The V-Roys just lock into a pretty authentic sounding groove. Earle continues to stray from the beaten country path and hasn't stumbled yet. Turn it up!"
2,Helpful!,Thank you for the excellent condition of this book and for getting it to me in such a timely manner. I WILL be ordering more books from you. The People's Bible series are my favorite and most helpful Bible study books!
2,Awesome,"This book, like the 4 previous is so totally AWESOME, I can't wait untill August when The Assasins is released. I just hope that it to is released early."
2,INTEX air bed,The item arrived on time and was easy to set up. It stayed inflated the entire night and was quick to deflate the next morning. We have always been Aerobed purchasers in the past and now find this Intex to be just as good quality wise.
2,Best of the best,"This is a fabulous collection, all these tracks were hand picked by Adam and Marco not some studio executives. You get album versions, single versions, demos and unreleased songs this set is simply marvelous going back to the old punk days of the Ants and into the most recent release by these amazing songwriters. I could listen to this set forever.Now if only we could ever get Persuasion released...."
2,"""IF I FELL""...doesn't begin well in this Stereo Remaster..!","In ""A Hard Days Night"" cd-- the stereo remasters are perfectly engineered except for the song ""If I Fell"" the begining of the song is very bad...and the ""..was in vain"" part of the song (at 1:43--listen to Paul's voice)...sounds like he choked.Don't throw away your old MONO ""A Hard Days Night"" cd...this is the only song you want to keep."
2,Good enough,I had a La Crosse clock before that died afer about a year. So I ordered this one to replace it. Hope I'll have better luck this time that the clock will last longer than that. Nothing to complain about the clock; it functions as expected.
2,Excellent discussion topics,"The best part about the book is the list of questions about the woman in each chapter, which makes you think a little deeper about the woman's story in the Bible. The questions are ideal for either personal or group study. The sections with background information were also very helpful. Since I am a little old-fashioned and prefer to use the King James Version of the Bible with its more poetic language, I gave the book 4 stars instead of 5."
2,Moon Handbooks: Costa Rica (3rd Ed.),"Having lived in Costa Rica and traveled there many times and, having purchased copies of most of the Travel Guides written about Costa Rica during the past ten years, I consider this by far the best, most comprehensive travel guide I have ever read. Many travel writers give you bits and pieces of information based on their preferences ... preferences which may/may not be yours. This writer provides a vast array of information about an exceptionally beautiful country so that you can make your own choices."
2,Great Deal for a great TV show,I really liked it specially that there is an offer of combining two seasons with one price....
2,Solid purchase,"The order arrived quickly and the ball was easily inflated. So far, it is holding up well and I'm pleased with the value."
2,HEART WARMING!,This book will touch the hearts of the readers as it touched my heart. The title sums it up. From the prospective point of a teacher it will be beneficial to all who read it. This book is one I recommend for all!!
2,Good start.,"A good start to the series, but the main audience is for teens. Adult readers will find the story lacking."
2,An excellent ethnic-Japanese/Techno collaboration.,"Uttara-Kuru's ""East Wind"" deftly combines traditional Japanese folk instruments - bamboo flutes, mandolins, and cithers (Shinobue, Shakuhachi, Shamisen, and Koto), sutra recitation, and free-style lyrics with ethereal Techno sound palettes to create thirteen tracks of original, ambient music. Essentially, the only disappointment is the sandalwood-scented booklet, which is written in halting, infantile English. According to it, the recurring theme is snow, and perhaps that is true about some tracks. To me, the music spoke of greater, almost ineffable things. ""Our Life"", ""Wings of the Eagle"", ""Niigata Okesa"", and ""Falling Through a Cloud"" are easily the best tracks on the disk, each taking a different approach to achieve great results. Boisterous flute melodies, sweeping synthesizer tones, hoarse chants, ululating lyrics, and nature sounds coexist to produce an enlightening, mind-opening effect. An emphatically recommended choice."
2,Simply beautiful.,"Rosana is one of the best-sellers singers in Spain, she has the power to decide to record an album every 3 years. Her selling status helps her very much with this kind of decision.She only has 3 albums and this one is the happiest one. Her letters are painful but beautiful. But ""Rosana"" has a little bit of everything, good lyrics, more flamenco rhythms mixed with that big talent that this woman has.Her music can be compared with Alejandro Sanz but she's much better.This album includes the hit singles: ""Pa'ti no estoy"" (I'm not here for you), ""Gira"" (Spin) and ""Hoy"" (Today)."
2,An excellent film,"Thank goodness this ""Thunder On The Hill"" is available now. This is an excellent film. Though set in the English countryside the film is made entirely on sets indoors. But the effect is convincing, not contrived, and made deliberately strange and compelling to reflect the theme and emotions of the film. It is a mystery you will not until the very end be able to guess ""who done it"". All the actors, most now deceased, are incredibly good. I recommend this film and urge viewers to agitate Universal, WB, etc. to release good copies of other classics from the bygone Hollywood era."
2,A good general overview and price guide,"Given the endless variety of costume jewelry, choosing which pieces to include in a reference book must be an overwhelming task. While not an encyclopedic reference, for its 150+ pages ""The Great Pretenders"" provides a good, basic overview. There is an adequate sample of just about every type of popular costume jewelry. The pieces are well photographed and realistically valued. If you need a basic costume jewelry reference for buying and selling, this is a worthwhile book to own."
2,A Real Compact Disc Of Greatest Hits,"This one is pretty good compared to a few other ""Best Of"" issues. Still a good one for the casual fan but by no means a substitute for a REAL best of collection (save that for ""This Is The Moody Blues"", Anthology & Gold). If your not sure about The Moody Blues & want just a solid collection on one CD, this one is the ticket.search ""Judemac Forever"" on msn,yahoo or google."
2,I will use my memory to remember only Thee.,"This is one of many dvd's by Self-Realization Fellowship that assists in keeping thought on God and Guru. With or without dvd's, book, cd's, let us practice the presences of God and Guru. Jai Guru."
2,A Diferent Viewpoint,"President Carter certainly brings a different overall picture of the problematic middle east. It seems that all of the information we get leans toward the Israeli side, whereas, Mr. Carter shows a more balanced view of the situation. A view that brings forth some justifyable reasons of why the palestineans have to fight the way that they do. I do not understand why our government doesn't push for a more equal give and take from both sides instead of being so one-sided with the Israeli's."
2,"""Contains information caregivers need to know""","""HOME CARE PROVIDERS may be interested in a new publication The Comfort of Home: An Illustrated Step-by-Step Guide for Caregivers written by Maria M. Meyer with Paula Derr, RN. We asked Rock of Ages to review the book and they were so impressed with it that they plan to begin using it in their MAIDS program."""
2,Scrapbooker's Organizer,"This is a must for organizing all your photos. This is easy to take to crop sessions, and it also allows me to sort and organize tons of photos."
2,"A little slow, but then....",The movie takes off and does not let up. I highly recommend this movie to people who enjoy Chinese/martial arts movies. The cinematography is really good and the fight scenes are superb.
2,A Bewitching Book,"Ive read this book a dozen times, easily. Each time is just as magical the last. As the characters develop they sweep you into their world. Every time you think you might be catching on to the story there is another plot twist or some small tidbit that you just know is a root for something to grow from, allowing it to pop up later in the story. An incredibly imaginative and complex book. If you read one book this year, make sure it's this book....just be sure to save the next two years for the rest of this chronicle."
2,Book description,"Enduring legend of the old philosopher who sells his soul to the devil in exchange for knowledge and power.Translated in a performing version by Robert David MacDonaldCover painting by Peter FarmerThe story of the philosopher-scientist who, in order to pierce the only mysteries unknown to him, sells his soul to the devil for a period of total knowledge and absolute power, is one of the most potent myths of our civilisation.Goethe's gigantic epic poem, the greatest dramatic work in German literature, has not attained the same degree of acceptance outside of Germany that such a masterpiece deserves.Now, at last, in a brilliant new translation, specifically made for, and already successfully produced in the theatre, the narrative sweep, shorn of metaphysical digressions and diversions is made accessible to both the reader and the playgoer..."
2,as advertised,"It works as advertised, used it to connect RCA 2 USB adapter to an USB flash drive.USB Gender Changer, A Female To Female"
2,Closer to the truth,"When I was young I had a passing interest in Japan - they had after all performed an array of miracles in their brief post-feudal history. I learned more of the same at University. And eventually I found myself living in Japan with a Japanese family. And the firm belief that everything I'd ever learned at home or in University was a complete lie.I've read a lot on the subject - and spoken to many people from Japan and overseas about the ""truth"" of Japan's history and future. Save yourself a lot of the hard work that I went through and just read Smith's well researched work. It tells all that the US did to bolster their own short term position in Asia - at the expense of the common person in Japan and the long term future of the country. The massive (insurmountable?) problems which Japan now faces are very well explained in this book.I only wish more Japanese people could read it. Then perhaps we'd see some meaningful change in this stagnant cesspool of a democracy."
2,"Great book, based my entire kitchen on it","I never took on a woodworking project before, this was my first, and I built an entire kitchen full of cabinets using this book as a guide. This is a great book very happy with it. Our kitchen came out great too."
2,The Sounds of Transylvania,"Awesome and most exotic and bizarre music ever heard and conceived by man.Hungarian folk music has a unique sound like no other in the world,excellent gift for a Hungarian friend or relative or for yourself.It will really remind the listener of the old country being so mystical and folkloric in it's sound.This is the music of Hungary when it was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire which lasted from 1867-1918 and has survived both World Wars and the Communist era.If you like Cajun music you just might like this as well,depending if you have an open mind and an open ear!:)"
2,Oasis simply rock,"If you truly love Oasis and if you can relate to their music, then there is no good or bad album, only slightly better ones. They haven't been voted the best brit pop group of the past decade for no reason!I am eagerly awaiting Stop the clocks!"
2,Great and undeservedly unknown,"This book is a fitting tribute to a great, self-made entrepreneur, whoset his goals on a daily basis, was highly self-disciplined and meticulousin carrying them out and above all, was highly ambitious in the bestsense of the word.Strangely enough, reading through Connie Bruck's Predator's Ball,which chronicles the takeover movement of the 1980s, and containsa considerable segment on TLC Beatrice, one of Drexel's majordeals, there is no mention whatsoever of Reginald F. Lewis. Strange.The writing in this book is not the greatest, and the author (not Lewishimself) has a habit of throwing around dollar words when it'sunnecessary and uninformative.However, this is the only autobiography of a great man, and one thatis also inspiring. Well Recommended."
2,Awesome Value!,"There were several reasons I settled on the Olympus E-500, some of which were due to the customer reviews from this site. I researched and read reviews, visited web sites from Canon, Fuji, Sony and Nikon. I also read reviews about the various lower-end DSLRs from those respective sites. For the price and features and quality/bang-for-the-buck - there could be no other choice but the E-500. I received mine on Jan. 18 of '07. The very first picture I took (camera on full auto) was my goofy face. I was stunned to see skin pores and little hairs I never knew existed! For better or worse, the detail I have seen with the two lenses are amazing. My other buddies (who also have more money than I) have a Canon, Sony and Pentax. I feel that the crispness and color are much better than the aforementioned DSLRs. This camera kit rocks! I received so much more for my $$s spent. Excellent!"
2,Klasse Stimme,"Ich habe mir eben ein paar AuszÃ¼ge aus dem Album angehÃ¶rt, ich find ees klasse. Auch dass Drowning wieder drauf ist, was schon auf dem letzten Natural-Album war.Er ist einfach talentiert und hat eine ungewÃ¶hnliche Stimme, die mir sher gefÃ¤llt. Live fand ich ihn auch klasse, als ich auf dem (vor-)letzten natural-Konzert war."
2,Good Buy,"I looked everywhere to find a tow bar that was both affordable and of good quality. I found both with this item. With free shipping, it was a no brainer. Thanks."
2,Buck fever,"Of course this is a classic. If you have ever been to deer camp, If you have ever had one too many, this is for you!"
2,Sizzling Hott Finale,"The Gang is back and this time more trendy, hotter, sexier and irresistable......I wish the show was never ending but nevertheless having a Collector's Edition makes me feel special..The show is groundbreaking and has certainly changed my life in some ways."
2,Best CD not just from Metallica but from any band,Metallica at their finest! They are probably the best metal band out there. This is their best album. All the song are awesome and Fade to black is sooo heart felt. I love this album!!!
2,the clock is ticking....,This book is a great read and very entertaining. The characters are developed well and the overall plot is unique (to me at least). I especially like the detailed battle scenes. Mr. Schaper obviuosly did his research. I would recommend this book to any one enamoured of military suspense drama.
2,Milwaukee's Best,"I ain't just talking beer.This is an excellent saw. I do alot of light construction on the side (friends, relatives, small jobs) and I've been through three compound saws. Bought the cheaper Rigid 10"" and it would never hold true. I returned this saw and bought a Bosch 10"" and this saw die on the second day. Thinking it was a fluke I exchanged it, but the new one left wavy cuts with the fine blade. Needless to say it was returned with a little bit of yelling.Well to make a long story short I got the Big Red 10"" Milwaukee and it's fantastic. Always holds true, slices like ""Hot Butter"" and is very rugged. The only reason I gave it a 4 was that it is spendy for a 10"" but if you do construction or just love having quality tools the ""BEAST"" is the one for you. This is a quality saw!!!"
2,It does exactly what it is supposed to do,"This device DOES sharpen knives like a professional sharpener would. It takes a little practice to sharpen knives using this machine. Yes, a little practice, but NOT a lot of practice. I suggest using cheap knives to practice with until you are comfortable enough to sharpen your good knives. I was not disappointed in this item and highly recommend it. Knives come our razor sharp. Plus the different stages allow you to vary the type of edge you like. Great item. But remember, a little practice goes a long way with this."
2,You Had to Be There!,"This was one of the Doors last concerts. Philly mayor (at the time), Frank Rizzo, said there'd be no trouble in ""his town"", refering to the recent trouble Jim had in St. Louis. This disc documents one of the most momentous shows ever. It was at the infamous Spectrum and you couldn't even cross the street to the venue without first showing your ticket and walking through a guarded maze of security (mounted police). Mr. Rizzo kept order but Morrison & Company delivered the good inside. How about the opening acts: Blues Image and The Staple Singers! If you were at the show, this will be priceless. Even if you were not, this captures one of the most energetic, electric concerts ever held! ""Philadelphia, the Music capitol of the world"", Morrison said as he looked out over the throng at the Spectrum. Yeah, that's even on here!"
2,Best Dark Tranquillity album ever!,"Without a doubt, an essential purchase for any heavy metal fan. A great album more similar to SkyDancer than their previous album. Great melody music with awesome clean vocals as well. Better than the new In Flames! Buy it!!!"
2,McCarty's Bach,"Patricia's performance of these suites is absolutely wonderful. Her playing is clean and technically of the highest level. I'm highly impressed with the amount of analyzation which has obviously gone into the preparation of each of the suites. This preparation has resulted in performances which admirably bring to life Bach's command of single line contrapuntal composition techniques.Of special interest to me is McCarty's use of ornamentation. Never overstated, her ornamentation enhances Bach's flowing musical lines in all instances."
2,A family movie at it's best,"I think I enjoyed this movie more then my kids. Funny, cleverly written with puns all though it. I was even surprised at the end."
2,Its the most helpful,"This book is in my view the best out there for anyone separating from the military. This is especially true in light of todays internet use for obtaining employment. In addition, the resume section is clearly excellent. As a retired commander from the Navy I recommend the book without reservation!"
2,"I was the dreamweaver, but now I'm John.","Here's a bit about me: I was not a Beatle fan until I saw this DVD. Beyond thinking that 'Day Tripper' had the coolest guitar part in the world, and that whoever produced 'The Long And Winding Road' did a good job, there wasn't much there. But my parents were big Beatle fans, and they had this around. This, along with Paul's book 'Many Years From Now,' turned me into quite a Beatle person. It's an awesome DVD, music videos for 'Imagine' and 'Oh Yoko!', some romantic scenes between John & Yoko, and just great fun. You must get the thing."
2,Good product,"Great video and I wasn't aware that Yoga was so hard - even the ""easy"" yoga. DVD in great shape"
2,The only way to read Shakespeare is with New Cambridge,"M. M. Mahood's treatment of ""The Merchant of Venice"", is both scholarly and readable. A fine list of illustrations, the lastest textual analysis, a balanced portrayal of the attitudes toward the question of usury and the Jewish faith,and the definitive text of the play make this a book worth reading"
2,It's pretty cool!,"This is a cool toy. It allows you to set up alarms in one of 2 ways. One has an infra-red beam, which makes a beeping noise when something moves in front of the beam and blocks it. The other has a sensor, which triggers a beeping noise when the sensor is moved. I enjoy using these to keep my family away from where they don't belong (my moms always going through my stuff)! The only reason i gave fun a 4 instead of a 5, is because sometimes the beam is hypersensative, and will just go off at random times. Overall, however, it is a really cool toy."
2,"Quick, in great condiition!",The item came quickly and it was in very good condition. I was very pleased.
2,Great Dividers,"I love these dividers! It works out great for my coupon binder. All my binder is, is a zippered binder with these dividers and trading card pages in it to then put the coupons by brand name or by product name. That simple. These dividers made it simple. I tried five-tab dividers, it just didn't work!"
2,Postcards to keep,Finding this artist's work in a coffee table book I found his work breathtaking. The vivid colors in simple every day scenes is delightful. Don't think I'll be able to send any of these postcard - they are just too beautiful!
2,Astounding!,"Ronnie Dio is the best live singer Black Sabbath has ever had. He is simply astounding on this DVD. The entire band is great, great, great! DO NOT PASS THIS ONE BY! It is an instant classic."
2,smooth,"It's not as dancehall as you might expect, but these grooves are still especially smooth, including the gorgeous new recordings by Nana McLean and Nina Soul."
2,WOW!!!!!,"I thought that this story was amazing!!!!! I didn't really understand the Civil War all that much but I completley understand it now. The movie really taught me to be thankful for who I am and what I have. The cinematography was also amazing. An the music really made the movie. There was a lot or racism issues that had to be dealt with and this movie also demonstrated the effects that racism has on people. All of the actors were great and they potrayed the troops/ soldiers from the civil was exceptionaly well. Overall, the movie was excellent. All I have to say is ""WOW"" !!!!! :)"
2,Woohoo!! It's a Hit!,"My 4 year old son got this for Christmas. He loves messing with my camera so thought he'd enjoy his own. He was at it immediately figuring out the 'how tos' by himself. Between him & his brothers (5 & 7), seemed someone constantly had this item.. be it snapping a photo, shooting a lil video, or playing a game. I was super happy it went over so well!! I read reviews so I knew it was one of the better 'kid cams' but was still impressed with it's durability & ease of use & it's just overall 'cuteness'. As you should expect - it's for kids so it gives kid quality photos which we all enjoyed just the same being that OUR KID(s) took them!! Plus nice to find a toy that won't be forgotten in the bottom of some toy box! I DO recommend this item!"
2,ALIVE...Everyday!!!!!,"I'm been taking these excellent vitamins since 2007 and swear by them. They make the difference in my everyday life. I take two each day (morning and noon) along with one omega 3 fish oil and nothing else. I have noticed a real healthy balance in my life, and can't say enough about the quality and price of these awesome whole food vitamins. LOVE THEM!!!!!!"
2,I love this book!,"I would definitely recommend this book to people. God recently set me free from the ""orphan spirit"" that I had struggled with for years and I didn't even know it even existed until I went to the Harvest Mission School that Iris Ministries runs in Mozambique last fall. This book is definitely a great timing for me to read because to shows you how to go from the orphan spirit of not knowing who you are in Christ to going into a new transformed life style of living as a son or daughter of the King and our Abba Father God. If you truly desire to know how God has always created you to live as His son or daughter then I definitely would like to encourage you to read this book. God wraps His royal robe of righteousness around you and His heart is just aching for you to live a life that He has destined you to live. Be blessed!!"
2,cute,"A cute little book packed with cool spells that work. Go and get this book, it's packed with spells and good info."
2,Great for low-back pain,"I am a personal trainer, & use this product for myself. 8 in 10 Americans will suffer from back pain at some point in their life. This helps keep the back supported in ab exercises that may normally aggravate low-back pain. Good quality."
2,Little Red Book Review,This book is well written! I love it! I'd read anything from this author. The illustrations make the book easy and fun to read.
2,AN EXCELLENT READ,"I thought this was one of Sheldon's better recent works. With his skill at handling many different female characters, the topic was perfect for him. The first third of the book and the last third were fantastic. The trial in the middle wasn't bad, but it wasn't really anything new either. Sheldon always impresses me with his capacity for research and his ability to create interesting characters. He's also fantastic when it comes to laying out a gripping plot, and that certainly was the case with Tell Me Your Dreams. Sheldon writes with style and confidence, and thankfully for us, takes pleasure in pleasing his readers."
2,Grade B Roth,This is Roth's effort at being Kafka. But the transformation made here does not have the striking originality and effectiveness that Kafka's does. Roth has a formula here which he plays out to the end. And the whole premise of the work is simply not very interesting. With Roth the effort to prove and justify is strong and this often leads to some of his worse fiction. This is mediocre Roth which means its language still has a vitality greater than most. But it does not convince and it does not move. It appears that the formula disappears once one seeks for true elegance.

2,A fantastic album! I just love OtherSide!,"This is my 1st Pepper's album and hope it's not my last. I bought this on recommendation from my friend and it's fantastic! Around the World is great, so is Scar Tissue and Purple Stain is fun too. Parallel Universe is cool, but my favourite song is DEFINATELY OtherSide. A wicked song with a cool video, Anthony's vocals are fab. Well done, RHCP, you've found a new fan in me!"
2,"This may not be Academy Award material, but I enjoyed it.","I suppose that you could say that this is a simple movie. It doesn't pretend to be some big budget, over the top, award-winning film. It also is not pretentious. It is a movie that simply tells a story of a family that comes into some money in an unusual way, and has to deal with the consequences of that windfall in the future. I enjoyed the story - even when the story seemed a bit farfetched. In fact, I found it to be a charming family-type movie."
2,Good,"Story good, animation incredible, characters interesting. Kids loved it and it keep their interest The thick brogue made much of the dialogue difficult to understand."
2,Sherbrooke bride,Good very romantic I loved it have read it many times everyone should read this book it's very captivating and just great
2,Great Gameplay and Story,The gameplay is great fun but the real surprise for me was the story that takes place between the levels. It's like watching a Star Wars movie that takes place between Episodes 3 and 4. There are many familiar characters as well as new ones that are very cool. I give this 5 stars because even if I wasnt a star wars fan this is a great action / adventure game.
2,DA BEST,this book waz really cool.....i luv david almond's style of writting......this has 2 b his best book yet! ! EVERY1 MUST READ THIS BOOK!
2,Good Earth Tea,I was familiar with the tea before I ordered it. We like its flavour. Lately we have had trouble getting it in our neghborhood stores and were delighted to see it advertised on amazon.
2,Fantastic pictures..Thoughtful narrative..Perfect design,"I can't give you a wordy, erudite critique of this book. I just know what I like. This is it! The pictures are beautiful to look at. And, if you want enjoyable reading for a child, or an adult for that matter, that doesn't 'talk down' to them, get this book."
2,"Good Design, Well Made, GREAT Price.","I had similar one of these units (was even an Xacto) about 35 years ago when I was doing a lot of ship & aircraft models and intricate painting of leather work accessories. My stepson has recently become interested in building models so I thought this might be handy for him. He is fantastically pleased with the unit. It holds small plastic parts and large ones securely without damaging them for both painting and gluing. The magnifier comes in handy at times for both. The base of the unit is heavy for such a small foot print, and if something heavy is put on one side, you can always balance with something of similar weight on other side. I have used it for couple of small electronics soldering applications and it worked well for those too.Great Price TOO -- Highly Recommend."
2,The Best Album Of All Time.,"They were the masters of their time, and still remain the kings, even today. If you don't believe my title and rating, ""Come Together"" and listen to Side B of Abbey Road."
2,This is his BEST!,"""Rodeo"" being my favorite song, made this CD a worthwhile buy in itself. Not to mention ""Against the Grain"", the first track, which is like the story of my life. Even though ""Which One Of Them"", ""Cold Shoulder"", and ""We Bury The Hatchet"" aren't the best songs in the world, they are not the worst either. Anything those three songs lack is easily made up for in""What she's Doing Now"", The quite brutal ""Papa Loved Mama"", and the exciting ""Shameless"". Not to mention the Dreamy ""The River"", which made a great ending to a great CD."
2,Joan M,I have had my AV500 for about 2 months. It's great and I can record my shows when I am not home. I don't have a DVD recorder plus I can take my AV500 on trips with me. And I keep my MP3s and photos in it. I am very please with it and have had no problems recording from the TV. Glad I got one.
2,This House is Epic!,I must say this is one of the best old school funk style house cd's i've ever heard. Track 5 on the first cd is my favorite tune called I Like It! I Really Like this cd it is one of my favorites now! I'm going to dj this in a club or a party someday. Peace Love Unity and Respect from Warren aka Dj Loco!
2,Wit and Suspense in one Package,"The golden age of mystery of the Christie era has been hard to match in recent times. The Deal Breaker might just change all that, it is a mystery set in modern times that for once is believable, the plot is cleverly thought out with the added bonus of making you laugh out loud from time to time. Myron Bolitar an ex basketball player turned sports agent is drawn into this murder mystery to help his client and ex girlfriend. Myron is tough, hansom, human and honest just what you are supposed to get in a hero, he also with the help of his less admirable cohort Win, delivers some of the funniest one liners ever written in a novel of this kind. I read it on the recommendation of a rather frail looking old lady working in a bookstore, although dubious at the time I cannot be more pleased to have done so. Try out a somewhat different but excellent approach to mystery writing."
2,"If you even were a casual fan of the West Wing, its hard to pass up this set","Its a beautiful set, the show is great, no problems to report. I highly recommend the show, you need to see it though in progression, its hard to pick it up if you are joining it somewhere in the middle of the building plot of each season"
2,One of a Kind,"This book is one of a kind....brilliant, great, adventurous, a classic. Words do not describe it. Isherwood lays evertything on the table. He shows all his cards. This is one of the most exciting books I've ever read. I'm a college student and I skipped all of the ten thousand other books I have to read in order to read this one. It was not a waste of time. Once you get into this book it's a blast. The best part is following Isherwood across Europe. If you want the definitive feeling about the Modern Era read this book. You will get to know such characters as EM Forster, W.H. Auden, and Virginia Woolfe.....Gee, ever heard of them? This is the last great classic Isherwood wrote. I was so entranced by the words that I stayed up all night to finnish it. It's defintiely on my all time favorite list."
2,beautiful illustrations,"I bought this book for my kids (ages 6 & 7 then) and they loved it, especially the absolutely gorgeous illustrations. I bought the hardcover and would suggest this as it is one book you will want to keep in your library!"
2,"Chubby Jackson, not Michael Jackson!!!!","Chubby Jackson, not Michael Jackson is who is on this excellent cd!!!"
2,A Pleasant Surprise,"This was not at all what I expected when I picked up this book. Reuvin and danny lead me into a world which I had never visited. It provided wonderful insight into the jewish culture, which I had previously been clueless about. A wonderful book for any season. Kept me hooked."
2,The BOMB!!,"The album is just the bomb!! I love the style and the entire essence of this group. They make me want to sing with them :-) This group captures what I feel is the mind set of the ""Joshua Generation"": They are at liberty to express a unique style of worship which comes by having a RELATIONSHIP with the living God, while sincerely presenting the true word of God! This is a hot CD!! Everyone should have a copy!"
2,Great 18 volt product,I read the bad reviews and most of them must have been about the 12 volt version. I bought the 12 volt version of this nail gun when it first came out 2 years ago. I had good luck with it using the 1.5 inch nails on most projects although sometimes had to use more force than I would have liked to seat the nails.When they came out with the 18 volt version though I was excited because the batteries were interchangeable with all of the other Firestorm tools I had. I managed to acquire one of the 18 volt versions and it is by far the best value for home owner cordless nail guns. Where the 12 volt would be slightly underpowered sometimes the 18 volt always had enough power to fully seat 2 inch nails. It seems to work even in oak. All in all great product for the money.
2,"Beautifully written, a page turner","This is simply one of the best books I have ever read. I really didn' t know that much about American communism and this book is helping me to piece it together. I also didn't know much about the Black Panthers. This part of the book reads as a 'can't put down' crime novel.I can believe this account of events because David was not only there for this part of our history, but he writes with such candor about himself and those around him. He lays himself bare in this memoir and writes with such beauty. It reads like fine literature.I waited for about 3 years for this book to come to the Kindle. I am glad I broke down and bought a hard copy. It was a wonderful read."
2,Works well,"Honestly, there is not much to say about it. We ordered it when we had to disconnect our dryer and connect it to another pipe. It works well for us."
2,Great bath toy!,My daughter loves this bath toy! They stick perfectly to the side of our tub and my daughter has a lot of fun with them.
2,Great bread and butter epidemiology/pathophysiology,"Third edition by author of proven merit in solving problems by context. Uses a think-along-with-me techinique which is annoying during rounds but very profitable in print. A must read, great review, regardless of specialty."
2,Hot But Lacking Something,"I got this as a freebie and it definitely packed a punch in the spice department, but it's not for the faint of heart. It is almost overwhelming at times like the author was trying to fit in every type of erotic scenario you can think of and I mean everything, including m/f/m f/f m/m and m/f. So heed the warning if that's not your thing. The writing wasn't anything spectacular and it did get dragged out and little overly melodramatic but if you're looking for some steam this is definitely for you."
2,Does the Job,"Unlike another product that I tried, this cold-starts my 6-cyl 1990 4Runner from a dead battery in no time flat. Sometimes I have to hook the negative cable directly to the battery node instead of the block.The absence of an on/off power switch wasn't as much of an issue as I thought because it comes with plastic covers that clamp on and off pretty easily. The voltometer guage is color-coded, so it isn't hard to figure out when it needs charging.The slim design makes for easy storage, but also means that it doesn't stand very well on its own without tipping over. I also would have appreciated an extra foot in the cable length (5' instead of the supplied 4').It feels pretty powerful to carry something like this and not have to hunt down another vehicle for jumping off. I'm definitely pleased with the purchase."
2,Great to get to the next level of programming.,"I can't say enough good things about this book. Mr. Connell is a pro, wrote professional programs that are running at companies such as IBM, GM, and others. This guy knows his stuff. Besides learning more than I ever did from a single book on databases, literally each page has a tip that can be used immediately. If you are a professional programmer, you will know what I mean from the first page."
2,70's Truck,"Installed in a older truck, moves tons of air, and looks nice with the new radiator. Keeps the temps where they should be, also make sure to use a shroud makes it work even better."
2,great condition,"awesome cd/dvd, in awesome condition, love the used. all the original stuff was in there including the used promos and coupons that came with the cd. very satisfied."
2,The model I received from DynaDirect via Amazon,"I was sceptacle about the order after reading the review here on whether I would receive one with the ability to disable the rocker switch, I actually ordered 2. The booklet states on page 11 how to disable this switch and the remote model number is URC-9960BJ4. Using information found on the net I believe my models have the ability to disable this 'battery eating' switch."
2,Got up for the down stroke,"This is the second comming of parliament as I knew it, and boys and girls it's funky.Get this cd and start with the original version then go directly to the Alternative version then start the whole thang over again. It's worth it!! You know the band was getting to roll. I love this disc. It sets the tone for the mothership and everything that would follow. if this isn't in your archives your just to finicky for the funk. It wasn't meant to be perfect like a showroom car. It's just good to your earhole. Dance around the house or kick back on it. A little side note... My favorite track is ""All your Goodies are Gone"" people that really know the funk,know it as the ""Loser seat"". Am I telling my age? yeah and who cares. Enjoy the Original funk/Rap/Dance crazy band. Yeah, I said it, ""The first Rap band"". Not Run D.M.C. Sorry!!!"
2,good stuff,"First shipment used for only a few hours then went bad. Calld the Customer Service and got replacement two weeks later, everything seems fine ever since. Easy setup, clear picture, I even recorded FOX's Prison Break and later viewed on the plane while I was traveling overseas."
2,Fresh and Fun,"I absolutely love ""Fragile"". Jen Marks unique song writing style shines in this latest album. A must have for your CD collection, you'll want to hit the 'repeat' button and play it all day. Then when you're walking down the street or riding in the subway, her lyrics will pleasantly run through your head."
2,A sociological study that reads like a novel.,"I was fascinated, enthralled and moved by this compelling self portrait of the Sanchez family. As a former resident of Mexico City I found it a revealing look at a side of life there that I was only vaguely familiar with. Even though the life stories being told were compiled fifty years ago, the book is still very relevant today. I'm not sure why Lewis's Culture of Poverty theory was so discredited - maybe it has to do with a sense that he is blaming the victim - but the evidence he presents is quite convincing, even though the reader does wonder how much he edited the data to make it fit his ideas."
2,Great container,"This container is great for storing dog food, bird seed, etc. The containers are clear and I love being able to see if I am running low on anything. The wheels make it very easy to move them around even when fully loaded with dog food. They appear to be very sturdy(I haven't banged them around though). I have always been happy with Iris products.We have put 30 lb of dog food in and have room to spare so the 36 lb capacity they list is accurate."
2,Good quality for the price,"These are pretty sturdy and have a nice weight to them. The handle is a little thin but definitely strong enough to do a great job. The spatula looks nice enough that it could be used for serving, although the logo is very prominent on the handle. It will certainly last much longer than the cheapo wooden spoons you find in big box stores. I am very happy with the quality for the price. You could spend a few dollars more and get something a little heavier if you prefer that feel but I actually like a more lightweight utensil so this one is fine for me."
2,"A Must For Any Sarah Vaughan fan, best place to start","This CD is an amazing compilation of Sarah Vaughan's best interpretations of classics like Summertime, It Might As Well Be Spring, The Nearness Of You. Personally, the lady does the best cover of Black Coffee compared to a lot of jazz singers. She is definitely one of the most amazing jazz singers we have ever seen in a lifetime and I would say, she is in the top three for the century."
2,Some great stuff here!,"As we have come to expect from OUP recently, there are some very good arrangements in this edition. Andrew Carter's arrangements of 'Teddy Bear's Picnic' and 'I Do Like to Be Beside the Seaside' are lots of fun, and the Bob Chilcott works display his excellent command of choral writing - some are simple, others more complex, but all are very effective. Grayston Ives' 'Name That Tune' is a hoot, but not for the faint hearted (difficult singing, if you're intending to do it properly).In my little vocal octet, we've tackled 'Sourwood Mountain' and 'Tequila Samba' with great success - they are certainly well written crowd-pleasers.I recommend this if you'd like some good encores for your capable community choir - they're very apt for that purpose."
2,"Carl Stamitz: Clarinet Concertos, Vol. II","Carl Stamitz: Clarinet Concertos, Vol. II is an EMI Classics from 1995 under the direction of Iona Brown who leads'the Academy of St. Martin in the Fields. We get to hear the amazing clarinette player Sabine Meyer. We also get to hear Sergio Azzollini on the bassoon on 3 tracks. Highly recommended. 5/5."
2,The perfect present for an MCR fan!,"A must-have for any MCR fan, these are now out of production and extremely rare, so finding Gerard at this price is the best deal you're going to get. Any true MCR fan will absolutely love this and it makes the perfect present!"
2,blood pressure monitor,"I like the monitor, the only think that I might change is the arm cuff is a bit stiff..however maybe that is the way it has to be?"
2,I'll make this short..,"At the time of writing this review there had already been 58 before me and they total an average of 5 stars. What more can really be said? I found this book very enjoying and thought provoking. Although Randall says to skip book one ""Transgression"" I'm very pleased I didn't. It added so much to the enjoyment of ""Premonition"". Great job Randall!!1 Star = I've been robbed!2 Stars = Why'd I finish it?3 Stars = Good4 Stars = Excellent5 Stars = Life changing"
2,Great CD,"I gotta say, this CD is great. I grew up during the 80's and these songs bring back some happy memories. My only dissapointment was the ending. ""Owner of a Lonely Heart"" has to be one of my favorite 80's songs. So when I heard what sounded like a ""glitch"" I immediately returned the CD to where I bought it and went to a different store to find a new copy. The first thing I did was play the last song, and, to my surprise, there was that ""glitch"" again. That was a very dissapointing way to end what could of potentially, in my opinion, been a 5 star CD. None the less, it is a wonderful CD including my favorite new song, My My My. If you can get past that ""glitch"" being there, then I say go out and buy this CD....."
2,This is NOT a western!!!,"This is a book written by a book lover, for book lovers. This is the chronicle of one man's efforts to learn, and the many unexpected paths that journey of self-education took.If you buy this book expecting a L'Amour novel of the frontier, you MAY be disappointed; but, if you love this author, books, history, travel, or especially the act of trying to live life on your own terms, this is a book that you will find completely fascinating (and may return to often through the years for insights and reading suggestions, just as I have)."
2,Great lens,"I just purchased this lens for my Nikon D50 that I had been using the Nikkor 18-55mm and Nikkor 55-200mm lenses on. These were good lenses but it was becoming very annoying to have to swap lenses constantly. The Tamron lens is worth it just for convenience but it also takes great pictures. I have been playing with it for a few days and all my photos have looked as good if not better than with my previous lenses. I decided on the 18-200mm lens over the 18-250mm lens based on recommendations from friends that are amateur photographers, the reason being that once you get up to and over the 200mm range you really need image stabilization at the longer ranges. If I decide I need a lens with greater than 200mm zoom range then I will probably buy a true telephoto lens with image stabilization. So far I can't see why some reviewers gave this lens negative reviews and less than 4 stars. I think it will be serving by photography needs for years to come."
2,The Man Who Came To Dinner,I am so glad that The Man Who Came To Dinner was finally released on DVD. The entire cast was great especially Jean Smart as Lorraine Sheldon.
2,"ADDICTING, FUN, AND POWERFUL","I have bought other work out tapes before but nothing like this. This is amazing!!! Not only do you get an excellent workout but you also feel more powerful, able to take care of yourself in any situation. You have to try it. What do you have to lose... except inches. Try it once and you wont want to stop. I've been doing it for 3 weeks now and have seen results in problem areas that no other work out tape has been able to give me! You'll love it!"
2,Great quick vacuum!,"If you need a great vacuum to take care of the light duty dirt on your floor, the Hoover Flair should be your choice. It has the power in a very light package to handle all types of floor and carpet. This is a great vacuum at a great price."
2,Very enjoyable for little people,All of the Baby Einstein movie collection is wonderful and enjoyable for little people. My 6 month old can't take his eyes off of the TV when those movie are on. Baby Van Gogh follows the rest of the movies and is fantastic.
2,"Very good reading, no gender bias","The PopSci magazine is a great science magazine. I always look forward to the next issue. It has many great stories relevant to life today. It also comes on time. They don't send obnoxious ""RE-SUBSCRIBE NOW"" flyers and it is an all-around great magazine."
2,Easy to use,"The Clorox Toilet Wand is an easy way to keep toliets clean. They are not as messy as other methods and leave the bowl clean and fresh. I would recommend this product to anyone who hates the chore of cleaning the toliet and wants an easy, effective way to complete the chore."
2,Good bulbs,"First of all this was a great deal for energy efficient bulbs. Second I really like these, my complaint about energy efficient bulbs has always been they are dimmer than ordinary bulbs and that they leave you with this weird white light, which is unusual when your used to the classic yellow light.HOWEVER, these bulbs while slightly hardly noticeably dimmer than a regular 60 watt bulb are a classic yellow light and I was quite impressed by this. I really like them, will likely order again when they burn out eventually."
2,Not what the title suggests,"This is a film about the Fryed Brothers Band. It's a good film and worth a watch, but it isn't about motorcycles. Although the Fryed Brothers Band is a biker band, so it follows the biker lifestyle."
2,Instant Start Season 4,"Season 4 was great, but it did not touch enough with Jude & Tommy. It seems so unfinished still. Oh well. Either way it was good and woth watching. Cheers!"
2,A must for any space lover!,"Wonderfully cast, written, produced, and directed. This movie is a must have for any space lover!! Some of the best work I've ever seen."
2,The Catcher in the Rye 3-ACE orange,"The Catcher in the Rye, by J.D. Salinger was a surprisingly interesting book! As a group we all agreed that it seemed unappealing at first, but in the end we found it to be the best book on the summer reading list. It described the experiences of a young man named Holden Caulfield after he was expelled from Pencey Prep School, a boarding school for boys. The author places Holden on a captivating journey through New York City and vividly describes every detail of it. These thoughts, adventures, and reactions are what make the book so easy for a teenager to relate to. J.D. Salinger created a story of excitement and intrigue that captured our attention and will do the same for you. We strongly recommend this book to people of all ages, especially young adults."
2,Oh my gosh! This book is AWSOME!,"I recently purchased this book and it is fantastic! It has recipes for hair,face, hands, feet, etc. I've tried some recipes and they actually work! This book comes with a spa box that contain 3 essiential oils and other items that are necessary. It also shows you to give a complete facial, manicure and pedicure! All the recipes are simple and you could find the ingrediaents in your kitchen! Enjoy!"
2,It does the job!,"I've had some great times with my Buzz <g>. Not too big, not too small (although it's a little on the thin side). Vibrations very nice. The only issue I have is the bullet does not fit all the way inside the base - this makes it not suitable for harness play. Can be a little tricky to remove the bullet after use. But, overall, it works for me."
2,This is a dictionary it is not that fun,This Is a dictionary it is not that fun and the rest is history and the world of their own way of their respective authors funny animated short term the first place f respective respective authors of this is history and the world to see if I had a lot of this article is history in the first to commentary on a dictionary medicine dictionary medicine and I had the world is not the world of a dictionary definition is a lot you have a good time fun and I have been a lot of their lives and I think the first time the first time since the world to see the rest of a dictionary it was not that the first to rate rating up
2,Excellent Product,This produc worked great. It greatly cut down the time needed for hinge prep. Make sure to order the proper bit for the job!
2,"Fun, fun, fun!!",Any music lover will love this game! Great for family vacations or just hanging out with friends.
2,"Anuphab Phraewphanarai - Bangkok, Thailand","This documentary on Marie Antoinette was superb. When I turned it on, I was glued to the screen. I accept the fact that this documentary does not show many actors completely acting out a scene, but along with the narrators and original paintings of the past, you can picture the whole story in your mind. In other words, the paintings and the pictures of Marie Antoinette and Louis XVI told everything of what had happened. It is just like reading a comic book without text. You can just weave the picture together yourself. I did not regret ordering this two hour film on Marie Antoinette, and I suggest that whoever is interested about France's history, should not miss the life story of Marie Antoinette"
2,Excellent,This book is just as good as Olivia and Jai. I loved every minute of it and I did not want it to end. I hope there will be another book about the Raventhornes soon.
2,Why O Why O Why O Did I Ever Leave Ohio?,"Well, gee, with music by Leonard Bernstein and lyrics by Comden and Green, and Roz Russell croaking out her tunes how could this be anything be great? The booklet that comes with the CD has with some nice liner notes about the production and swell photos.Not for the uniniated, but a must have for the collector!"
2,Tell me about cheese.,This is a book that gives you all kinds of helpful information re cheeses. It is an excellent reference source to have on hand at home.
2,Love this product! ( & so far all others that they make),"All of the Japanese bath salts are very nice. Very soothing and refreshing, The salts go a long way and I think that they are quite econimical if you like baths. I also like the orange and mint for summer. Great bath salts!!Fast delivery!"
2,This is a super cool Sci-Fi book!,"Who wrote that dumb Publishers Weekly review? My friends and I read this Captain Nemo book and listened to the book-on-tape. This thing is GREAT!!! We loved the giant sea creatures like Goliath and Hermes. Very cool writing. We are doing book reports on Jules Verne and we have read 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea and Mysterious Island. We have to admit Captain Nemo has gotten tougher, smarter and his Super Submarines: The Nautilus, The Trinity and The Avenger are works of genius! Just like the mysterious Captain Nemo. We hope there will be a sequel. This would also make a great movie or comic book. A bunch of us are artists and we drew a bunch of scenes from this book."
2,Alittle out there,"I got this CD because I liked the song from the movie, ""Unfaithful"". I like a couple of other tunes also..very unique CD..and love the guitar."
2,Wonderful Christmas music,Very interesting collection. I like all types of music so it was great to find something a bit out of the main stream. This CD blended well with my other Christmas music.
2,Lives on the Boundary,The book was in very good condition and didn't have nothing wrong with it. The shipping didn't take long at all which I was really glad because I ordered it not even a week before school started.
2,Beautiful and grand. An instant classic.,"One of the more complex and unique things i've ever come across. Very haunting and epic. Kaada and Patton will be remembered for a lot of their work, but this one will definitely be a career gem for both."
2,Nice Surprise!,"My husband heard this song on the radio and told me how much he liked it. I didn't want to have to go to the crowded stores since it was a Christmas gift. So, I looked up the name of the song/CD on Amazon, they had it, and I ordered it and it was delivered quickly and in good condition. My husband was completely surprised as he never thought I would remember the name, much less buy it for him! He loves it."
2,Excellent advice,"This was a terrific and extremely useful presentation. The steps discussed in this presentation were clearly explained, realistic and do-able. They are applicable to work or home. Being a teacher of middle and senior high school students, I found the informaiton particularly useful. I highly recommend this to anyone. I plan on listening to this at least once a year to refresh my skills."
2,dyson,DYSON DC 6 HANDHELDGave it as a gift to my mother-in-law for her stairs &/or furniture. So far she is very pleased with the handheld dyson.
2,Extremely sharp bluray quality,"This bluray boast a very sharp video quality. From start to finish I was very impressed at how good an old movie like this can look. Extremely enjoyed the extras which had interviews with all the cast. Pace of this director's cut was a lot slower than the original release as how the director intended. Along with it you lose Mel's character narration that was highly enjoyable on the previous release. Even for such an old flick, you can see all of Mel's wrinkles and see his age."
2,Gremlins 2,"Bought for my daughter. It was fun to watch when I was younger, and she likes it a lot now. Campy, and with a decent soundtrack, I expected nothing less."
2,Exelent,"I have the spanish language version, but even after translation it is still one of the great general physics resources, specially for the first 3 years of the degree on physics."
2,LOVE IT!,I am TOTALLY obsessed with this show and it was on a REALLY good sale when I purchased it (only $19.95!). I was able to get free shipping and I got it 4 days before its expected arrival date. Thank you amazon! Can't wait to buy the next season from you!
2,quality mix,"this is a quality mix, great tracks and great mixing. im a big ATB fan lately. if you like this, check out nightmusic vol 1 + 2, anjunabeats (whole series), and global underground 028, 030, 024 (nick warren)...cool stuff"
2,Magically Entertaining,"Hearing that the DVD of Harry Potter featured bonus scenes and additional insight into the making of the film, I chose to splurge on the DVD over the VHS version. Mind you, I did not own a DVD player when I ordered this film. The morning after my shipment arrived, I went to the store to purchase a DVD player and that night, we watched the movie. The quality of the DVD is wonderful and the sound is amazing (we hooked it up to our stereo speakers). The bonus features include a tour of Hogwarts as well as ""skits"" with the sorting hat and even web-interactive activities in which I have not yet particpated. All-in-all, this is a great way to watch the movie though the widescreen viewing makes my 20"" television seem even smaller. I suppose that is the only downside, now I need a TV that can hold its own with Harry Potter's DVD quality."
2,Washington's best work,"Training Day is a stunning drama about the mean streets of L.A. Officer Hoyt (Hawke) is a young eager cop who joins the elite narc division in hopes of one day becoming detective. His ""training"" officer is Harris (Washington), a street savvy cop. The movie takes place in one entire day and as the day goes on, Hoyt begins to see that Harris is a different breed of cop. He gets the crooks allright, but he bends the rules and more than often crosses the line.This role is a departure from Washington's clean cut good guy image. Washington's character is a twisted, shrewd, and manipulative cop. There are also cameo performances from Dr.Dre and Snoop Dog. In my opinion, this movie was about LAPD's infamous Rampart division."
2,Just right for grandchildren,"I prefer this chair to a traditional high chair with a tray because child can join us at the table. Some similarly designed chairs only have one vertical strap. The design of this chair seems better with an additional strap around the waist. Unlike other chairs we looked at for $200+, I would not trust a two year old to climb in and out of this chair without assistance, but the chair is certainly sturdy enough for them to sit and eat in it."
2,Good Product and price,Worked well out of the box. I am quite satisfied with the price and performance. There were no problems with the hook up and I would recommend to a friend.
2,GOOD ILLUSTRATION,This book will present you with the basics of computers and ever more techie stuff. The important thing more than just an actual book is hands-on learning.The publishers can improve this book by using colors and bigger font letters.
2,"Great Album , NOT HIS BEST....4 STARS.","This album is a great album, a classic because of Songs like:Bump Grind, Your Body`s Calling, Sex Me I & II and 12 Play track.Really this songs makes R.Kelly 12 Play ...But get me wrong this is Classic R.Kelly Bump N` Grind Album so you know what I talking. So go and get it."
2,nice one to control flashes,nice to control flashes and play with light for creative photography.. keep in mind it need batteries which is not included and you need to order them separately.
2,"Not as good as live, but worth the purchase","I just saw Amanda live at a local outdoor concert. The girl is an incredible fiddle player. She played nearly none-stop for 3 hours and ended the show with the same energy she began it with. I bought the CDs at the show and have not been disappointed. Most tracks are as good as the show, others seemed pushed. I've let my students listen to the CDs for several days now in my Louisiana history classroom and I still enjoy them. Check out her other CDs too."
2,Can't get enough!,"This is a copy of another reviewers thoughts, but it mimics my own so much I hope she won't mind. This cd is wounderful!"" Reviewer: Adeona98@aol.com (see more about me) from Sacramento, CA This is the first flamenco-style cd I've ever purchased and I'm sure glad that I did! All the songs, whether fast or slow, make you want to dance...it's just about the best cd I have ever bought from only hearing one sample. If you're looking for passionate guitar...this is it!"""
2,I WASN'T DISAPOINTED AT ALL,NIV'S 3rd cd has a great hardcore sound it rocks star to finish and if your fan you must check out this cd i hope rescue will reisuse the first 2 cds though cause they were even better than this one but NIV fans need check this 1 out anyway
2,First aid kit,The kit was fully stocked as described.I did how ever have to aquire a few things from my local walgreens to complete the kit for my needs like sanitary wound cleaner and extra gloves along with a c-collar and ambo bag to complete the kit.I think for the money this was a bang for the bucks.my total after the few addons was about $160.00
2,"How does one film a classic, starring birds, in 1973?","This is a rare, timeless work. I've been a fan of the book for many, many years. It took me until 2005 to track down and order the movie. While the film (30+ years old) doesn't live up to the book, I give it 5 stars becuase it stands alone as a superb movie. I guess I would give the book 6 stars if Amazon let me."
2,Worthwhile Reading,"The book came in good condition and swift shipping. Good seller, would use again. I haven't gotten all the way through the book, (it's for a class), but what I have read has been great. Everything is clear and well expressed, and certainly an excellent aid to anyone wishing to further their education in this field."
2,Great ink,"Product arrivent promptly in the time frame given. Nicely packaged. Easy to use and has worked very great, I will order my refills with them!"
2,Full Featured Film: Deep Impact Leaves a Deep Impact.,"If you don't like movies that stirs up your emotions, don't watch this movie. It is a very realistic depictation of what could happen if a meteor was discovered heading our way. This movie looks at the human implications, the human drama, the human effect such a disaster would cause. More than the physical damage and upheaval, it is the human damage and upheaval that counts. You may not like every character, but realistically, do we like everyone we meet? This movie is a fantastic combination of action, romance, and sci-fi FX. It's both a guy film and a girl film, which is why some don't like it. If you want your films to be only ""all guy"" or only ""all gal"" you may not like this one. But if you want a film to hit you in your heart, in your mind, in your soul, in your gut, this is the film for you."
2,Stroud is the real deal,"Les Stroud, now in the third season, again demonstrates why he IS the Survivorman. Keeping up his method of being completely alone and filming his entire week (as opposed to hotels and set-up wildlife encounters, a la Bear Grylls), Stroud takes us on another journey into a situation no one ever wants to ""really"" be in. Stroud's editing is excellent, and his tips on survival really may make the difference in living or dying, should one find oneself stranded. An excellent watch, well worth the time you'll spend, and relatively family-friendly. No cursing or anything, but he does occasionally kill and eat stuff."
2,Mine! After it's fixed..,"September 19 2011I bought this clarinet for my first time in band. I read how ""easy"" it was to play, so i got it. I LOVED IT SO MUCH!! It made a very good sound and always was good. Until.... it broke.One of the main keys that holds most of the clarinet together was sticking all the time. i just shook it off, hoping it would go away. It didn't go away, but got even worse! It got so bad I couldn't even play my clarinet without messing up. And without me, my band has 4 clarinets, who you can't hear over trumpets even if your life depended on it.My band director knew it was never my fault. I almost never mess up unless something is distracting me. He took a good look at it, but he couldn't do anything.About a week ago, he took it into the music store for me to get it fixed and I should be getting it back tomorrow.As soon as my clarinet returns, I will elaborate some more. But for now:ProsEasy to playGreat sound qualityNice Carrying caseConsIt broke."
2,Buy this book,"I bought this book on a whim, and I'm glad I did. I found the book to be hard to put down, I enjoyed reading it that much. I plan to buy the authors 1st book too."
2,Great Buy for the Price,I was pleasantly surprised by the heft and solidity of this inexpensive crossbar switch. It is well made and works very well. If you need a way to multiply and select input options to any audio device (e.g. computer or amp) this is a hard-to-find and highly useful device.
2,2nd best fiction ever written!,"This is my 2nd favorite fiction ever, right after Atlas Shrugged by Ayn Rand. ""Hideous"" is brilliant because it combines a pragmatic look at evil people and diabolical conspiracies with a wit and humor that keeps me laughing on almost every page.And in classic Lewis style, interwoven everywhere are religious allegories and symbolism. This book is a treat, like a creamsicle on a summer afternoon.I was confused at the beginning since the story seems to suddenly break from the 1st two in the trilogy, both in storyline, and in the fact that there seems to be no science fiction in Hideous. But everything becomes clear later on, and the trilogy is truly continued.This may become known as the most undiscovered book of the 20th century, but it's a classic and a literary jewel."
2,An emotional depiction of the reality of hate based bias in America,"This is a story of how some religious groups encourage and fuel the fires of hatred of gay people. It also shows the difference between religions being fair to Christianity . The story is quite real to life the depiction of a gay couple, showing the normalcy of their lives until the extremist hatred of the most radical Christians moves in next door . In America, this kind of hatred exists and manifests it's self frequently . A must see for all families . I believe this to be a good film for all ages. Other than a little adult language this is a great movie for the entire family."
2,Built Tough,"Its been six months now and this thing is built like a tank. Have it in the living room along with a bunch of antiques and it still looks in place. Had a lot of comments about it from guests, all positive."
2,Excellent warhammer 40k material,This paperback is in the same format as most of themanga out there right now(ex. tokyo pop manga).It is a compiliation of the3 titan graphic novels that were previously releasedand is entirely in black and white.The way the book was bound made it a bit difficult toactually read and the spine felt like it was boundtighter than it needed to be..unlike some mangathat i've read in the exact same format.Actually started getting cramps in my fingers and wrist.The art varies a bit from chapter to chapter..and some of it seems a bit rough but overallI got a very good feel for the story and charactersfrom the art.The story is excellent and has enough variation thatit will not bore you. I couldn't put it down and finishedit from front to back as soon as it came in the mail.I'd give it 5 stars but the quality of the binding leftsomething to be desired. I don't like cramps when reading.
2,Great deal!,"This bike was a steal for $50. It took about 30 minutes to assemble and my 7 year old could not be happier. The bike appears to be well made and has very good brakes. The kick stand and one set of pegs was missing, but amazon gave me a $15 credit. This bike is definitely a step above the cheaper Mongoose and Diamondbacks. And for only $35 total I am still laughing. Thank you Amazon."
2,so great,"RUN,DO NOT WALK! GET THIS CD NOW. RHYMES AND JACKSON RULE AND ARE BOTH SO TALENTED.""WHAT'S IT GONNA BE"" RULES I LISTEN TO IT EVERYDAY.I CANNOT GET ENOUGH OF IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Forks Over Knives,It changed my husbands life and my life. We went from meat eaters to vegans overnight. Our cholesterol levels have dropped significantly in TWO weeks. We both lost over 20 pounds just by changing our eating habits and we feel great. We have been living this life style for 10 months now. We purchased about 20 copies of the DVD and give it out to anyone that is interested. My husband is a physician and he recommends it to his patients.
2,When it says one Egg it means one egg,"It's not kidding about being able to fit a single egg.I was hoping to use this to make grilled sandwiches but it's cramped fitting a single slice of bread.It still works moderately well but only grills and heats about 80% of the sandwich.I use this in a dorm room with a hot plate burner and the amount of space the small pan saves is really outstanding.As far as the heating it heats quickly and evenly due to the circular ring pattern on the bottom of the fry pan.It has been easy to clean with and without grease or butter.When I have used it without butter or something of the sort, the no stick feature is pretty evident as well as nothing has burnt or stuck to the ban and everything has come off easily.Overall it's a great little utility pan for limited space or being on the go but it really is meant to be used for very small portions."
2,The way you love me,Faith Hill has chosen wonderful songs for this album. She glides through the lyrics with ethreal ease. Each song except for the first three and Bringing Out the Elvis were very deep and heartfelt. This is more adult contemporary than country or pop and allows her to expand her fan base. I bought this over the summer and I listened to it alot. Everbody who hates it should try to appreciate the depth of her voice and try to understand the meaning of the lyrics. This is a pretty good album and I reccomend it to anybody who likes Faith Hill.
2,"put your feet up, and get ready for a long stay","This is great read, a fun way to soak up meticulously researched history and to live with some very compelling characters. Robbins knows his stuff and he delivers the story with style."
2,A must-have for anyone who works with children.,My college students take turns choosing and sharing an affirmation a week from this book. This much-loved book is now falling apart after more than 300 students have taken a turn with it. I'm ordering a new copy today!
2,Savages,"I loved this movie!! There was only one part that I didn't enjoy & that was towards the end.*Spoiler Alert*The ""rewind"" at the end was annoying. They should've just gone straight through with the ending instead of rewinding part of the story that never happened. Great movie, A- would have been an A+ if they didn't have the ""rewind"" in the ending. Either way 2 Thumbs Up, *****s or however you want to rate it. I will be buying this movie on 10/23/2012 when it is released to DVD."
2,Great SLR like camera,"I have multiple cameras, including an Olympus Evolt 500 (SLR), and a Fuji V10. This S700 takes great pictures and is easy to use. I haven't tried all of the settings, but I know it works great outdoors on Auto as I took some pictures of hummingbirds that came out crisp and clear.This camera is small enough to wear on your belt, but I usually use an over the shoulder case with a strap."
2,An okay introduction,"This book is pretty clear for the most part. The authors present the material in a way that tempts readers to skip the proofs at the end of each chapter. For that, this book loses a star."
2,Peak DFD,"This is DFD's best album, with Committed To A Bright Future coming in a close second. Heavy, Melodic, groovy, sexy, rockin jammy jammage. I mean, what review for this album could REALLY sum it up? Find out for yourself and pick up the most exciting and original album of 2006 and prolly the rest of the decade. This album is a kick in the teeth to all the carbon-copy manufactured radio bands and the whiny, boring emo scene. Best songs are Dead Virgins Don't Sing, 100 Suicides, Rose Covington, and The Hitchhiker. Its time for this band to get some limelight and have some money put BACK in their pockets for all their hard work and originality. Still a force to be reckoned with, Dog Fashion Disco are back with their most GRIM, eclectic album to date. Get all their records if you can b/c they all rule, but Adultery is the cream of the DFD crop. Buy it."
2,the only product that really works,"I purchased Occlusal HP on the advice of my podiatrist for plantar warts. The pharmacy wanted to sell me on of the less expensive over the counter remedies, pointing out the salcylic acid content is the same. Those have never worked for me though, I was willing to pay the extra buck on the advice of my doctor.With patience and diligence, Occlusal HP has been an effective cure for plantar warts. A word of caution, it does take a long time, longer if the wart has gone untreated as long as mine had. It is also very helpful to purchase a ""scraper"" and scrape/apply medication routinely to the affected area.I have avoided going for a pedicure because I was so embarassed by my plantar warts. Finally, I can wear the strappiest of sandals and have my feet pampered again!"
2,I love it,I love this show. For Christmas I will be purchasing season 3 as a Christmas gift to myself. I love british comedy. Much thanks to my coworker who recommend me to watch it.
2,He and I,He and I is one of the most motivating books I have read in a long time. In reading this I have become closer to Christ and it seems in adoration Christ always shows me something that inspires me to live as the saints. It is simple yet thought provoking.
2,The best comic,"The words above tells everything about the comic. It's the best, better than Watchmen and Dark Knights. The comic that my mom read and love and it's the best thing i can say"
2,Very happy with the product & the service,I am very happy with the service from amazon and the product. Excellent & would recommend this to anyone.
2,"Tough, but goat heads are tougher","I wanted a tire that could roll over goat head thorns, but unfortunately I rode through a patch and one bad trucker of a goat head thorn managed to puncture my tire. Otherwise, it's fantastic. I can ride over fire trails, potholes, glass, sticks, and small children playing in the street without a single prob."
2,"""Everyday People"" mixed with some Kurt Cobain?....brilliant","I really enjoyed this movie. I haven't really seen much of Ryan Reynolds except for when he was in Smoking Aces, but it was nice to see Rachel Weisz. Ryan Reynolds has more than charm I think we will see a whole lot more from this guy, he really did some great acting, and to me this movie is definately more than just a chick flick/date movie."
2,ACDC ROCKS!!,"You see some original footage from when they first started,a must have for any ACDC fan!! I absolutely loved it!!"
2,Its more inky than others,"Amazon requested a review for this from me.. so here it is. Its great. Not sure what else to say, anyone using this printer knows this is the only ink you should use. Epson has high quality pigments that will last for years, Epson claims it will last even centuries before fading."
2,Great,First off this game is great awesome. The courses and great cars which can leave you playing for hours. You get to choose cars from all over the world form Japenese to U.S.A and the graphics are great.
2,Elizabeth,"This is a well researched and documented book which gives appeals to the reader who wishes to be both entertained and informed. It reviews the largerly overlooked portion of Elizabeth's childhood and her interaction with those that surronded her including her fight for survival as the throne changes hands. The book ends when Elizabeth is crowned and the reader is left with the question of what happens next? Fun, humorous and sometimes shocking this book is a sure way to become hooked on biographies."
2,Perfect mixing cup,This cup is the perfect size and shape for making my breakfast smoothie with a stick blender. It cleans easily and and is of good quality. I am very happy with this purchase from Amazon.
2,Great product,"Handy small bags that are strong enough to handle the big dogs ""stuff"". Fast shipping and fits into my handy leash container"
2,Decent,"I have always been a Left Behind fan ever since I read the first book. This book contain good enough drama, but that last two chapters were the most unique (in a bad way). Jenkin's basically gave the reader at visual rundown of the events to come, instead of having a cliffhanger. Overall the bestparts was the bomb at Petra and the magical healers."
2,Fun But Choppy,"Edna St. Vincent Millay, Dorothy Parker, Zelda Fitzergerald, and Edna Ferber are perfect exemplars of New York in 1920s and Marion Meade's book, Bobbed Hair and Bathtub Gin, captures that time in a somewhat arbitraryly episodic fashion. This is not the place to come to get a good biography of any one of these women (Marion Meade's book on Dorothy Parker is a delightful place to begin for that) nor does it capture its time period as well as some other similar books (To Be Young Was Very Heaven about women in New York before the First World War) but there is still great delight to be found in these pages as one skims through the lives of these rather amazing women. If there is not always much bobbed hair as promised, it is made up for by great heaping quantites of bathtub gin, among many other libations. As well as many romances, a few abortions, great literary successful, and some professional failures. It was a time and it still makes for a wonderful read."
2,"It has ""The Promise"" on it","Since 1980 I have loved the Bruce song ""The Promise"". I have countless tapes and bootleg CD's with poor versions on it. So when Bruce released Tracks and I bought it content unseen - I was deeply disappointed not to find it on the 4 disc set. Now I see it is on here and, for me, $18 or whatever will be a bargain."
