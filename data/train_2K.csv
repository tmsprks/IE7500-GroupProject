1,TOO SAD for young kids,"If you think that the cute unicorn on the front of this book makes the book a great gift for your fun-loving preschooler or kindergartener..... think AGAIN! This book is inappropriately sad. If your child is even REMOTELY sensitive, this book will knock her out. My kid bawled & we had to get rid of the book after only reading it once. It was traumatizingly sad & just WAY TOO MUCH. If you are buying this book, BE AWARE of its content before bestowing it upon some unsuspecting kid. We got ours off a library discard pile & then we threw it out."
1,Prince brat and the whipping boy,This movie really let me and my entire family down it was not even close to anything I or any of my family members would pay free money for let alone hard earned money that we through away on this bogus movie. Its bad enough the republicans steal all the money from the working class now were being taken over the coals by the movie industrie I can only hope this review gets to the poor sap who was going to buy the really bad movie next!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,The description is incorrect....,"The sleeping bag is ultralite, but is NOT warm. I was cold and sleepless at 50 degrees. I wish I had spent a little more and bought similar item from their competitor."
1,Depressed,"This is a hideous conflation of bad taste, inept singing and inappropriate orchestration. One of the worst I have ever heard. The screeching B flats in Casta Diva, the groaning 'scooping' in O Mio Babbino Caro will, I am sure, have made Puccini and Bellini turn in their graves. What on earth makes this woman think she can sing great music. Her arrogance is breathtaking. If she must sing, other than in her bath, could she please concentrate on areas that are not so convincingly beyond her musical and vocal capacity."
1,MAJOR let down,"I was quite satisfied after i initially filled the bags and sucked out the air..but within hours, air gets back inside the bags and you must re-vacuum them. This is the whole point of the product- keeping the air OUT so they stay compacted..Even after resealing and vacuuming multiple times, the air always gets back in- there is no permanent seal. DONT waste your money!"
1,an algebra refresher . . .,"If you had taken algebra a few years ago and need a refresher for your GED or ASVAB, this book will be fine.If you have never taken algebra, or like me, took it 20 years ago and have forgotten most or all of it, this book is almost useless.at best you get a short paragraph on the theory of the problem to solve, then you get the answer. very seldom do you get a breakdown of the indvidual steps that took you from problem to conclusion. this is the first ""Dummies"" book which I have ever thrown across a room."
1,it was a good thought,"I was very excited to see a Tool tribute album, but very disappointed by the time it was spinning in my cd player. The cd has great intentions..anyone attempting to pay tribute to an amazing band like Tool has great intentions, but these bands have nowhere near the musical creativity and technical talent that Tool has. Granted, their creativity and talent are very rare gifts, but the cd just didn't turn out that well, and doesn't appeal to me at all. My advice is save your money, but if your goal is to own every single piece of merchandise with the word ""TOOL"" on it, go ahead and pick it up. There are a few moments of faint musical enlightenment, but for the most part, I'm not liking this spin on Tool's songs."
1,Don't put your weight on it!,"First off, Rudy Ray Moore is not Dolemite in this so called third installment of the series. He plays an ex-cop turned DJ and Dancer named Tucker. Secondly, this movie has very little comedy and action both of which made Moore famous in Dolemite and Human Tornado. The most important thing about this you should know is that it seems to be one big repetitive mess based on ""Angel Dust"" and its terrorizing effects on the human brain. There are far too many scenes of hallucinating and the synthesized background music is almost nauseating. All in all the film is a waste of time and shouldnt be mistaken as part of the Dolemite series. Oh and by the way, Don Johnson and Madonna are not in this movie"
1,"You've been living underground, eating from a can","3/4 of the album is filled with songs as bad as 'Grace'. 'Vertigo' for example, was a hit single, and a terrible one. Cheesy, terrible song with dumb as hell chorus and pseudo hard-rock guitar. What else need the band of the guys who have lost their talent years ago to get some attention these days?.This soup is whole dull and has the most horrible lyrics in Bono's life. When the announcement of a new U2 album rang through media outlets, a question emerged as to whether this was going to be their best album. Unfortunately, it's sad to say that this very well may be their worst effort.The only thing missing from this album, with the exception of some actual rocking from what used to be a pretty decent rock band, is a label on the cover saying 'Buy an iPod.' Give it another video before little iPods are dancing around as Bono cries for world peace."
1,Disaster.,"This is one of the worst law books I have ever read. It was assigned for an upper-level constitutional class. Trying to decipher what the authors are attempting to impart through the near total use of squibs as opposed to full opinions, and their own cryptic notes interspersed among snipets of the cases, is next to impossible to accomplish. In addition, their particular method of editing is intrusive and annoying. Some of the brightest minds in the country have written classic opinions on the very important subjects in this book. Why in the world Sullivan and Gunther think they can do better is beyond me given their result. Avoid this book like the plaque if at all possible."
1,"The ""mystery"" remains a mystery","Unfortunately the assumed promise of this book, to determine if Russian-German actress Olga Chekhova was indeed a Russian spy during the 1930s and 40s, is never adequately discussed or even mentioned beyond a number of tantalizing hints. Instead what we have here is a family history of Chekhova's years in Russia during the Revolution through the 20s and Nazi years in Germany. It all seems rather skimpy and vague. Even for those wanting further information on Chekhova's career as a stage and film actress will find very little here, only a few names and film titles -- the same for any of her so-called ""relationships"" with Hitler and other top Nazis. A disappointment and not recommended."
1,Audio version is a disaster,"It seems all the reviewers exposed to the audio version had the same reaction I did. Mr. Roker self-narrates with only occasional hints of embarrassment all the banal details of getting to be a father, leaving absolutely nothing out. I tried to hang on until he actually gets into the kind of parenting situations alluded to by the title and cover photograph, but I just couldn't make it. One-third the way into the presentation, The baby's still not even born, and he and his wife are deciding how to decorate the nursery (they ultimately chose to sponge-paint the walls). That's where I bailed, feeling ashamed with myself for sticking with it for as long as I did. I've never felt so abused by an audio book in my life."
1,PIECE OF CRAP,"I COULD CUT THE GRASS FASTER WITH A HAMMER, IS DULL, AND THE FLAP BEHIND IT IS USELESS, THE HIEGHT AJUSTER IS A PIECE OF, IT DONT WORK ANOTHER TONKA TOY"
1,Infra Red!,"I had no ides this unit was infra red and could be blocked be walls. When I first tried it out I was shocked when I discovered that it stopped working when the transmitor was blocked by a plant on my TV. It seems to work fine if there are zero obstructions, but, as for me, I will try to get my money back.P.S. When I purchased this item last week it had four stars."
1,Don't buy this book,"This book says absolutely nothing. It has a few good pictures (the best one is one the cover by the way), but the text is utterly worthless and uninformative. My favorite quote from the book is ""Nonlinear means not linear."" Really? Don't waste your money. Now I understand why I found it at the used bookstore."
1,Leather Phone case for 7100i,"Said it would fit the BB 7100i, AND IT DOES NOT, Phone antenna hole dont line up, ear holes dont line up, mic hole dont line up..other than that phone fits after CUTTING A NEW HOLE FOR ANTENNA!SO PRODUCT DESCRIPTION AND INFORMATION ABOUT FITTING MY PHONE SUCKED............. I WILL NEVER USE AMAZON AGAIN......"
1,I hate this mug,This mug is hard to clean and does not keep your coffee hot. It does prevent spills-I will give them that.Oxo products are usually good. This mug is awful.
1,West African Rhythms,"I bought this DVD for my wife as a Christmas gift along with a Drum to begin learning on. Although someone beyond beginner status might find this video usefull, we did not and I don't recommend it for beginners.The DVD has no instuctional value for people just starting out."
1,Embarassed,"I STRONGLY dislike this product for 3 reasons:1. The tapes are poor in quality and will tear the briefs plastic cover regularly2. VERY NOISY- I swear the only people who won't be able to hear you walking will be at least 15 feet away or deaf3. LEAKS!!!!!!I was wearing this product earlier today as I was in class and I urinated and this brief leaked horribly! It was humiliating I was in the front row of my calculus lecture and I noticed a large wet spot on my shorts and t-shirt. Not only that, but when lecture was finally over and I attempted to bolt for the door I could feel the brief noticeably sagging.Also, this is not a product that was designed with comfort in mind, I was only in this brief for about 2 hours and it wasn't pleasant. It bunched and pinched A LOT!Basically, this product is NOT discreet, comfortable or effective and thanks to the sub-par design of this brief I have experienced one of the most humiliating events of my life."
1,English?,"I haven't seen this movie yet. Does it have English subtitles? I don't speak French. The only experience I have with this film is that I would like to see it, but I will not buy it if it does not have English subs."
1,Buyer Beware,"Seller's do not disclose to the buyer that this is only one disc in the set. Many will think it's a great deal, but buying one cd brand new for $15 and not getting the whole set is not a deal. Buyer beware."
1,HUH?,I received this as christmas gift from sister. Brand new in the box never been opened. I was so excited but that quickly dies when I took it out the package pluged it in and tried to turn it on. NOTHING!!!! The on/off button doesn't even work. It does charge my i-pod though.....But I can't listen to it or do anything else with it. Now I am off researching a new one!VERY DISAPPOINTED!
1,Do i buy or rent your books?,"Like many others, the fact that Amazon has not only built in the capability to delete your books as they want but has actually done it, is incredibly scary. I bought and paid for what I wanted but apparently Amazon's wants override mine.I'll rather have a standalone device which I control and I can use as I want, rather than what Amazon lets me do.That this happened with George Orwell's books? Laughable and incredibly ironic."
1,Revolting,"I really like the Peter Decker/Rina Lazarus series, but this book is an unmitigated *bomb*. I only made it through a couple of chapters when I put the book down with disgust. In other books, Kellerman occasionally concerns me--mildly--with her rather sexist and hypersexed portrayal of women (does every red blooded man *really* feel a tug in his pants when he looks at a pretty lady?), but Moon Music was over the top. While I do not consider myself a prude by any means, I was disgusted by the sleazy, one dimensional characters and their sleazy behaviour. If I want a rollicking mystery, I'll read Justice or one of the other Decker/Lazarus books, but I'm selling this one back to the used book store."
1,Not satisfied at all,"This product was of poor quality and did not come as described. Also, the item was already out of the original package when I received it. I was not satisfied at all with the item."
1,Do I HAVE To Give It A Star?!,"Yes, I mean that. I really hate to have to give this book ANY stars at all! My awesome friend thought that I should read it, and I did, and the whole time I was going through the pages, I kept reminding myself of my vow to finish it. I kept hoping that it would get better on the next page, and then on the next page, and then on the next page, BUT IT NEVER DID. The story was ridiculous, too far out there, and it was very poorly written. And there was even one part that was just downright OFFENSIVE, and anyone who knows me knows that I do NOT offend easily at all. I just... hated. this. book. So much. It took me eight weeks to read (literally), because it was that downright AWFUL. Alright, I'm done ranting now. Just, I highly recommend that no one else ever read this book. You will desperately cry and scream for the last [however long it takes you] of your life back. The end."
1,Do not give as a gift - unless you wish to be cursed,by the person you gave it to every single time they try to use it. I have tried to use this product to install a medicine cabinet in the bathroom as well as assemble a cheap set of shelves. It was unable to drill through the backing of a cheap medicine cabinet. It was unable to drill drywall. Not worth the aggravation.
1,If you are a home-cookin' kind of person...,"...don't buy this book. The recipes are too gourmet for someone who is looking for simpler recipes. There are some interesting scientific tidbits in the book, but I was not impressed at all with the recipes. Glad I only spent a buck on it through one of the used book sellers on Amazon."
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought one of these and ended up taking it back. These are built defective. Mine had dust behind the screen. Apparently, they are all like that, as I was told when I returned it back to the store."
1,Way Overhyped....,"This game has definitely been overhyped. I've played THQ's PS2 Smackdown: Just Bring It and I can't believe the same company has put these two games out. The gameplay is extremely hard. I have won one match so far on Eacy setting. The players reverse every move you make. No story line, next to impossible finishers, and...[bad] selection matches make this A BIG BUST!!!The only positive thing about this game is that it is the only wrestling game on XBOX right now. I DEFINTIELY REGRET...[PURCHASING THIS] !!!! I like my XBOX but I have to admit that Smackdown 3: Just Bring it is light years ahead of this one!!!"
1,POOF!,I have had these for about a year. I also have M35.POOF! no sound! I have never had a pair of headphones to go out completely. Some had shorts in the wire. Some fizzled. Never POOF! No Sound!
1,Zero Effect,"The name says it all doesn't it. It had Zero Effect on me and my two buddies who watched it with me. I hope Ben stiller and Bill Pullman gave what they earned to charity. At least that way their time would have been waisted for a good cause. If only I had given the five euro rental charge to charity instead of the rental shop. I would have save myself a major BARF session. I'm giving this one five thumbs up, my lowest rating yet! The time I put into Zero Effect could have been spent talking to this babe I like."
1,Get the 5x if you really need the illumination,This magnifier is powerful but poorly made.The is significant distortion in the corners and along the edges leaving only the center of the lens useful and if the available light isn't enough you're out of luck. When what you're looking at is in focus the built-in light isn't shinning on it.I'd have returned it as useless except that there are times when the ambiant light is enough to use this magnifier without needing it's built-in light.As a reminder of how useless the built-in light was I took the magnifier apart and removed all the light's parts. I'll use them as spares for the 5x version which works well and it's light is properly aimed.
1,"Buy the music, read better books, live the blues...","I really resent the titles of the ""XXXX for Dummies,"" since as a teacher I think it creates self-images of inadequacy... The book is OK. Man, the blues is music. Get out there, get the CDs, Hound Dog Taylor, Rev. Gary Davis, Miss. John Hurt, Muddy, etc. Listen and enjoy and support your local blues organizations and clubs. Books for dummies. Nah."
1,GARBAGE!,Bought a two pack of these. Absolutely worthless. They must be seconds or rejects or rebuilds or something. Only lasted a month each before turning to a trickle. Two filters in two months? That's $30+ per month for filtered water. Might as well install a Culligan system. The ones I originally bought at Home Depot lasted almost a year. Tried to save money by buying at Amazon. Should have known. Stopped working just in time to miss my return window. Worth the extra $10 price tag to buy elsewhere.
1,Waste of my Nickel and Dime,"Waste of time. I don't really even want to waste my time writing a review on a book that was so boring, poorly written, narrow minded, and biased."
1,What a game for sissy's...,"For Starters the main character looks like a chick. He's poorly developed and extremely lame. This game follows the same pattern after each colossus kill, you go back to the castle and a voice tells you a stupid riddle, then you ride for 30 minutes looking for the colossus. Then Repeat again... These people saying that this game has a storline must have created it out of their own imagination. All in all this game is crap."
1,"Cheap Knock-off, Don't buy!",The reason the price is so low is that this is a cheap knock off and not a real Bespoke labs blow dryer. Mine stopped working after 9 mths and there is no warranty. You get what you pay for I guess.
1,Didn't work out of the box!,"My parents had this phone so i registered for it as a wedding present. It didn't work out of the box and as with most wedding presents, i didn't have a receipt and they wouldn't take it back. We tried to go through Motorola to fix it, but that was a nightmare. Just be careful!"
1,wrong description or wrong product........,"The product was fine if they were trying to sell a Hellraiser 4-disc set instead of a 6-disc set. In which, was what I thought I was purchasing. I would return it if my kids did not already open it. As for the product, it was a brand new 4-disc set of Hellraiser. What's not to like about that. I won't buy from this seller again."
1,hot blooded,the story starts of really good then out of nowhere you have to stuggle to finsh the story.
1,This author's anti popper zeal blinds him to the facts.,"I'd seen a refernce to the book on an AIDS website that attempts to debunk the well-known and inconclusively-proven fact that AIDS is caused by HIV. The author, along with the others on this site, seem nothing short of zealots who need a soapbox to help in their shameless self-promotion.Lauritson's anti-popper stance is as unwarranted as his stance on what causes AIDS. He does a disservice to the public who will undoubtedly be mislead should they read his book.His brand of false alarmism is a shame."
1,Rockport - Not Waterproof,"I own a pair of Men's Rockport Waterproof Moc-toe Chukkas Dark Brown, they are so not waterproof...Rockport proved to be useless against rain. My feet got wet after I took a walk down the street in the rain, and I thought they are supposed to be ""waterproof?"" I am very disappointed. Maybe they should be labeled ""water repellent"" instead of ""waterproof""!!!!"
1,Complete Twaddle!,"I'm sorry, but after wading through this, my first encounter with Ms. Rice, I don't think I'll bother with any more. It was like chewing cardboard. And what the hell was that 'Some Lamb' rubbish???"
1,I guess you either love it or hate it,"My 8 month old was slightly amused at first, but now is only interested in playing with the small pieces that come with it. It IS irritating how it only plays one song. No real interaction. Expensive with what you can get for the $$. I got it as a gift, and wish they would've gotten something else."
1,THIS IS NOT THE DOTTIE I REMEMBER!!,When you grew up listening to Dottie--you remember the way she sang the songs orginially----This just doesn't have the Power or Spirit that I remember Dottie having. The Miner's Song is the Pits!! Could she not pull something out of her Songbook? Sorry--But when I want to listen to Dottie--I'll go back to her earlier works.
1,IT BITES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This game bites. Every time I play it freezes up and it's not even fun. It has horrible graphics so don't waste your money like I did. (...)
1,Just for the record ...,"If you really want to read a GREAT showbiz auto-biography, get Anthony Rapp's book called, ""Without You - a Memoir of love, loss, and the musical RENT."" It's wonderfully written and purely said. It's hungry and courageous. It's gripping and all the things you want a bio on Barbra to be and everything the latest release on her is not. If I were you ... and just a suggestion now ... I would buy Anthony Rapp's book and wait for the real thing with Barbra. You'll thank me later."
1,Repeating the mistakes of others-the anti intellectual approach,"This book portrays nephrite as a virtually monochromatic(green) stone to make cute animal carvings from(ala Lyle Sopel) or to be displayed in a form not far removed from a monolith. For an alternative and highly instructive view read ""Jade Country"" by Theo Schoon, which outlines how this short sighted approach wasted much of the most beautiful jade in New Zealand. North American Nephrite is the geological equivalent of New Zealand's, and obviously is being handled by the industry in the same way as it was early on in New Zealand. Too bad!"
1,Wii Play with Boring 2 player games,"I am not quite sure whether it was the fact the original games were just so great that came with the Wii, or it is just these games really really suck. I ultimately bought this pack because I needed another wii controller stat. Then I read the games and thought wow, those would be fun. I typically have at least 4 people at my house so having this pack of games which all of them are only 2 player is not any fun. I will be selling this game pack back to the store during my next trip. I will be keeping the wii controller though."
1,Doesn't Work on MAC,"I brought this as a gift because a friend wanted clip art for her classroom, but it doesn't work on MAC (Apple Computers) at all. Online on Amazon there is a long list of programs it says this clip art disk is compatible with yet it is all lies. Do not waste your time or money buying this clip art disk. I returned it."
1,Good idea but poor quality at a high price!,"The idea of having a collar to train and contain your dog is a good one. I have owned 4 of the smart collars over a two year period now, and am very disappointed with the performance. On two dogs which do not require much of any training, the batteries only last a couple of days. I have watched and it is not because the dogs are constantly testing the fence. This is just a poor product masquerading as a good one at a high sticker price. Beware! You are not getting a good product because you are paying a premium price. Shame on Innotek!"
1,did not keep fingers warm,"Very disappointed with these gloves. I used these gloves for the 2nd time today, both times my hands were cold. A previous review mentioned extra cotton gloves inside helped; I tried that today but my fingertips were still cold to the point of numbness. Today's temperature was in the teens and I was outside operating the snow blower for 4 hours.I would not recommend them."
1,Cartoon with bad editing,"I found the story in this book enjoyable but every time I came across another editing issue, it pulled me right out of the suspension of disbelief. And the editing issues are frequent. I mean, seriously, how hard is it to edit a book and make sure ""the"" is not spelled ""tge""? Ridiculously amateur in the writing and editing.Fun story, not particularly original. I got it free and read it on my kindle. Glad it was free. Won't be reading the next two in the series.Steve Alten: learn how to write man. And hire an editor. Please."
1,Chinatown: Bad trip,"What Happened to the Be Good Tanyas???They were great. I loved their first record and made everyone of my friends buy it. I personally bought 8 copies as gifts for people. It was fresh and bright.This new record is so bad, I cannot get over it.They mumble the lyrics and all the lilt and jubilation that had been evident on the first disk are leaden.nothing like littlest birds here.Sigh.Big sigh.I had such hopes for them.They still sing well, but really, you need good melodies and there are none here. nothing original,nd it really breaks my heart.I really did think they were great. Now I want them to pay me back for the money I spent on the disc.I cannot afford this and keep on trying to like the disc.It only frustrates me.Fan no more.Nora"
1,Somewhat useful but with some serious omissions.,"Six weeks prior to going to France, I ordered the CD's. Used them daily prior to the trip and found them helpful to refresh my limited French from years ago and prior trips. A glaring omission: The CD's teach you to ask for a menu in English, but give you absolutely no food items in French!!! This is a real problem, given that you gotta eat in France and not all restaurants have their menus translated into English, or if they do, there are still some French food names sprinkled throughout. This can be alarming if you do not care for tripe or some other non-translated specialties. A lesson on basic food names would be essential for this series to be really useful to a newcomer to France. Can't really recommend it."
1,A Great Film Series,"Having discovered that all the AIRPORT movies were in one DVD set I was very excited about it as it is one of my favourite film series. I received them very fast considering they were imported from America. I am very pleased with them, although having read some of the reviews that were submitted I was very disappointed that so many people has criticised Airport '75 because in my opinion it was without a doubt the best of the Airport series. I thought it had a gripping story and was very suspensful with a great cast and score to back it up. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone, and is definately a worthy addition to this fantastic film series. Also to all those people who don't like the movies here is a tip, DON'T BUY IT, and leave them alone for the people who do appreciate them."
1,Incomplete description,"What does Non-GE mean?One of the most annoying things about Amazon, whether the product be sold by them or through them, are the incomplete descriptions.The information would be helpful to potential buyers and therefore to the seller. Incomplete descriptions only lead me to ask: what are they hiding, or, are they trying to dump something on the unsuspecting?"
1,erm... this is bad.,"I know this has been said countless times, but I just feel like driving this very true point in further. Limp Bizkit has no talent. None whatsoever. Fred Durst's ""look! I know how to say the F word! isn't that so Fing cool? F this, F that!"" Which does only appeal to 10 year old children too heavily influecned by Carson Daily and his homies on MTV. If you want something good then look into Black Sabbath, Godsmack, Red Hot Chili Peppers and even Metallica."
1,micah,"i'm one of the faithful Anita Blake fan but this book make me so angry that I had to paid the full price for such a short and dissapointing story.Unlike other reviewers, I love the character of Micah just wish L.K.H. stop wasting the precious pages on the description of Micah's body. I want to find out more about his past than just the fact that his ex- did not like how big his ""private"" is.Don't waste your hard earned money on this book, save it for Danse Macabre... uhh maybe!"
1,Beliveing in Myself Meditations,"I have been reading this book for about a month. Out of those 30 days, maybe 2 readings have had any significance for me."
1,Way overpriced.,"Don't know what the hell is going on here, but you can get these at any Wal-Mart for 33 dollars any day of week."
1,wish i'd read these reviews before i purchased!,jammed on the 2nd lid i opened with it -- got that worked out. quit working completely after 4th can i opened - went right in the trash.
1,small occipital base pivot piece part #1950,"I am a physical therapist who is trained in Cranial Sacral therapy. I do not feel this pivotal product does the trick for self treatment for myself or my patients, unless you wedge it under your neck on it's bottom edge (not flat) while lying on a pillow or bed that can help stabilize it. Perhaps it would work better on a pediatric patient?? The neck slant piece it too short. I was under the assumption I was ordering the larger model that seems to fit adults better - I have used that one before and it is much more comfortable to use for self treatment. I am contacting this company for a replacement."
1,Authors have been widely discredited,"The authors of this book are a bunch of liers and Monday morning quarterbacks. None of them actually served with Kerry on the swiftboats or has personal knowledge of any of the events. It is a pitty to see the Republican Party supporting this kind of irresponsible, baseless character assassination. President Bush should renounce the claims made in this book, and in the advertisement sponsored by same group. Afterall... where was President Bush when these events took place? Cowering in Texas, avoiding his national guard duties."
1,"Not the Greatest, but Not the Worst","Like many other reviewers, I went into The Rule of Four expecting it to be similar to Dan Brown's work (which I LOVE!). The authors spent a great deal of time of developing the character's relationships with one another. At times, suspense would be building when they would delve in a character's past, which I didn't enjoy. I must admit I was confused at several points at some of the interpersonal issues they had with one another. I must have missed something earlier. When I finished, my first thought was ""That book was confusing."" It was good, but not great, and could have been better."
1,Does Not Work,I recieved the watch not functioning either because it is defective or that it does not contain a battery. You must return the watch to Malaysia only and not a local service center. You will pay shipping charges and a 10% restocking fee. The watch and customer service was not the quality that I expected.
1,cheaply made,"My son was so excited to recieve this... the amp and battery all worked fine and had no issues with them, however, in the first day a string broke, and then another the next day... i realize this isnt a fancy professional electric guitar, but it still wasnt cheap and shouldnt have strings snapping off everyday... disappointed and so is my son.."
1,Good Turned Bad,"I was in the middle of reading this book when Oprah found out that Frey was lying throughout this book. In the beginning I was enjoying the book, and felt horrible for all the details that author was describing that he went through. Half way through the book, I heard that Oprah found out that this was all a lie. I forced myself to continue reading the book. I could not shake the feeling throughout the book that the author was lying about everything. I think that if the book was actually accurate and true, it would be an enjoyable read. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!"
1,Not that good,This figure is good but isn't truely worth your money. It isn't anything special. What i recomend is final battle jango fett. the final battle jango comes with everything this one has. The reason i think the final battle jango is better is because his arm has a flame thrower and his head pops off like when mace windu cut it off. I only recomend this toy if you have the slave one ship. otherwise buy final battle jango!
1,Good but not good,"This clock radio was a gift for my wife who was pregnant so that she could listen to ""hypno birthing"" while in bed. We've always had luck with stylish Sony CD players. However, this time we had a few problems. Within 4 days of coming out of the box, its broken. Not only is there a couple lines missing from the display (a '3' looks like three parallel lines) but something is blown on one of the speakers. It sounds like the kind of distortion you get from putting too high of a pre-amp volume into a secondary amp. its all distorted. Unfortunately, since it was a gift, the box got thrown out. Now we're unable to return it.If it were 100% working when it arrived, it would still leave something to be desired, since clock radios sound like .. clock radios. I'd love to have some external speaker ports where I can plug in my much larger extra speakers and get a nice sound."
1,Save your $,"Save your money. Unless you're in this movie or just want to see the Wisconsin countryside, don't waste the money. Not only is it a bad movie, it's sexist! Stupid all around."
1,Poor Quality,"Creative MuVo MP3 Player have problem playing particular mP3 songs. It plays WMV file songs smoothly. However, it always give a buzz when playing MP3. The voice recorder's quality is acceptable, but it consumes a lot of power when recording. If I were you, I would definitely give a thought on this MP3 player!"
1,Low resolution only,Very poor signal unless you use the 1024x768 resolution. Does not provide a good picture at higher resolutions.
1,Bluetooth Dongle,Very dificult to pair with every device I tried. Software does not have detailed instructions. Even after I managed to get it paired it has yet to connect to anything. Gave up and tossed it in the drawer.
1,I wasn't lucky.,"It didn't work. The time and cost of sending it back isn't worth it. It would have been handy, but I can do without it,One other thing. The battery this unit uses isn not one you are likely to find in your local supermarket."
1,Worst of the Dear America Books,This is by far the worst Dear America I've read. It gives no real thought to Civil War history or slavery. Teaching slaves to read NEVER! The reason I think the author did this is because he was trying to make the main character pro slavery with its corresponding racism would have made her too unlikable to readers. Down side of this it makes slavery seem OK as long as the owner didn't beat them to often. Slavery is never OK no matter the conditions the slave is keep in. A slow enlightenment of the main character would have been much better.
1,You Get What You Pay For,"I ordered 4 white 29x64 blinds and I am careful with venetian blinds of this quality but to no avail. Two of the blinds snapped at the top while letting the blinds go down for the night. I had to re-order both of them. The second replacement has a wand that is very hard to turn to allow light in or out. Therefore, I must unfortunately have to say that these blinds were made very cheaply, and you must be very gentle with them or they will break, and you may get a blind that is totally defective. I have to recommend to everyone that you should pay a little more for a better product. Venetian blinds should not break even when you are gentle with them. I can't recommend this product. Look for something else. Two blinds breaking and one wand hard to turn is quite un-acceptable."
1,"Good Idea, Poor Controls","This is designed as a straight forward kids' game but the controls are too difficult to master, Dewy falls off ledges and cliffs too often. The game becomes frustrating but the idea of a little raindrop changing forms to battle bad guys is pretty cool. This could have been a lot better if the motion controls usage was better."
1,Great acting...but lacking in the edit department.,"The costumes and acting was great...however Catherine's character was made out to be a very sensual character. This isn't a movie for kids under 13 years old, so be forewarned."
1,The Worst Movie I Have Ever Watched - I Want My Brain Cells Back,"This appears to have been a pilot for a television series that wasn't picked up and then turned into a movie. The premise is that a Judge chooses from his court files people and cases that can serve as life lessons for the viewers. In this morality play, the Judge chooses the case of a rich criminal defense lawyer who misuses his law license by defending people accused of crimes (aka the scum of the earth). There is not a single thing about this movie that makes it worth watching. From the repulsive characters, to the hammy acting, to the inane plot that completely falls apart at the end, this movie is a one star stinker that should be avoided at all costs. I want my seventy minutes back!"
1,junk,"just junk, just don't buy it, there are other better products with better optics and more control, be careful with thse because you will become dependent upon them, so get good ons. Remember to check adjustment after a car wash as the usually get moved by the water. Amazon sells better rectangular device that I have used on several cars to drive 100s of thousands of mile...Properly mounted and used, these devices can be life savers."
1,"Worked well, but broke early on","I bought this for my mom and it worked well originally. The massgae action is nice and soothing, and the heat element is great for those whose feet get cold, like the elderly.The problem was that the right side heating went out after about 3 weeks of light use. Still works for the massage part but no heat on one side."
1,Why is Brian Steel still selling this book?,"Brian Steel is still selling this book despite his disaffection with Sathya Sai Baba since 2000. Unlike other authors who have pulled their books after their disaffection, Brian Steel continues to try to make money off of Sathya Sai Baba by selling a book whose contents he no longer advocates for or believes in! Consequently, who can recommend a book from a former devotee (turned Anti-Sai Activist) who now has nothing good to say about Sathya Sai Baba?"
1,"Wonderful film, terrible DVD","I'll leave comments about the value of this movie (which I love) to other reviewers. what I want to warn buyers about is the rediculous lack of features on this DVD. There are, literally, NONE. There's not even a language menu for close captioning... it's essentially like buying a VHS tape that's been transferred to DVD. Don't waste your money."
1,best of porter wagoner,"I am very dissatisfied with this cassette--I already own The Best of Porter Wagonercd collection, and none of the songs on this one appear there--if fact they are songs I have never heard, and I am very familiar with his songs.Incicentally, I don't recall purchasing this--I don't normally purchase without first seeing a list of the songs on a given cassette or cd.Very dissatisfied customer, Butch Ramsey"
1,Zen Vision M 30gb,"Bought for my brother who is legally blind to charge his Zen player so he did not have to turn on the computer to charge it up.Little did he know that it wasn't putting out enough power to keep it charged. He thought that the battery went bad and Best Buy Geek squad said the battery was toast and tried to sell him a new player. He is on disability and asked me to see if I could fix it.After taking it apart I realized that there was nothing wrong and plugged it into my computers USB and it was fully charged in hours. It will run over 6 hours non-stop on a charge. Two things I learned, 1. The Geek squad knows nothing about Zen Players.2. Get a second opinion if you go to best buy. Unfortunately, this unit was out of warranty by the time I discovered the problem! No return Lesson learned."
1,"Nice music, but sometimes discordant.","I don't know much about Andes music specifically, but I do have a background of many years in classical music and spend a lot of hours listening to world music. This is a pretty nice little CD, if you can get past the occasional sour note, and the mid-to-low production quality. When I have it on, I like to remind myself of the value of older records' nostalgic feel and of music outside the palate of glitzy, mass-produced songs that airbrush away the odd note gone awry."
1,Wrong Number,"I received e-mail from the company that actually stocks and ships this product for Amazon. They informed me that the listing may say 12 items, but it should only be for 1. I was not asked if I wanted 1, just told that they would have to cancel that portion of my order, and did I want the other item that I ordered. Needless to say I cancelled the entire order. Maybe Amazon should proofread a little closer to ensure the correct number of items are offered."
1,Just a pat on the back for Christian beliefs,"Fine if you are a non-jew. However, the Torah clearly defines the role of the Jewish people in this world as handed down by Hashem at mt sinai: Teshuva - To repair the world. To do mitvahs and be a light unto nations. Read a book or books from a real Jewish point of view, eg, The Committed Life by Rebetzin Esther Jungreis"
1,10- movie Kids Pack,"Some of them are good, some are not I won't buy them this way again. The quality is poor on many of the movies and of course younger children don't appreciate the black and white verson of the older movies."
1,Short-changed,"I saw the original miniseries on t.v. It was quite good. However, the vhs tape I recieved thru amazon.com was cut by 50% or more which totally ruined it. To anyone viewing it for the first time, it wouldn't make any sense. The continuity is so chopped up all we're left with is a collection of seemingly unrelated events. The scenes that were left out connect everything together and also were very interesting as well. I don't like anybody deciding what is enough for me to see. Especially at $19.95 a crack plus shipping"
1,Core concepts obscured by lousy writing.,"Overall the concepts in the book are (1) important to understand and (2) easy to understand. So why is the book so poorly organized, the writing horrible, the examples unhelpful, and the book an overall disappointment? This isn't multi-variable calculus. The only logic I can posit is that the authors were more interested in writing a scholarly text than a readable one. Although many concepts are made unnecessarily complicated, the biggest grip I had is with the writing style. The examples only loosely tie in with concepts, and flowery ""professor-speak"" obfuscates relatively easy concepts pointlessly. And in their effort to be PC, they'll switch pronoun gender from ""he"" to ""she"" or ""him"" to ""her"" multiple times, even in the same example. Just sloppy. But the text covers the basics, so it gets 2 stars."
1,Sick,Parents need to smack themselves around a little bit if they think this is the way to raise a decent human being.
1,OK........Disapointing,OK. I have seen every horror movie under the sun and this one was sad. No horror no suspence and bad scripting. Rob did a great job directing but the problem is the people didnt fit thier roles. But it does have some interesting parts like people being stabbed in bunny suites and girls cutting up a guy to disco funk music...
1,consumer,"I don't know how psychologists use this to muffle noise. It just isn't loud enough. I bought it to muffle unpleasant bathroom noises in our small apartment. This product, the Dohm-DS speed Sound Conditioner, even at the highest setting, sounds like a low fan. I'll have to find another solution."
1,"Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Sp...zzzzzzzzz","I love this cast! Love Gary Oldman and John Hurt, and most especially love Colin Firth. That said, wow, what a dense plot, what straight-faced line delivery, and such confusing cuts back and forth to the past, back to the present. At least I THINK that is what was happening. Don't ask me, though, because I fell sound asleep after about a half hour of wondering if Gary Oldman's character was going to remain silent through the entire film or eventually speak. My husband also fell asleep.Recommendation: For fans of serious, British, ponderous, impenetrable drama."
1,Not what I expected,"Having ordered this due to the auto-suggest I expected something similar to a Joe Satriani album...i.e. tight playing, haunting melodies etc.. However, what we have here instead is an indie bedroom album, while some of the songs have novelty interest, none of the songs are developed nearly enough and the overall production not of a quality expected for its price range....tinty drum machines, someguitar tones that sound like they are played beneath a blanket. Lastly, there is really no linking theme between the songs which leaves a listener without a proper code to appreciate what Nikhil is attempting. In summary, this album is fine if you realize you are getting an entry level work by a young aspiring artist, not a carefully crafted product of an artisan...."
1,The Mermaids Chair Audio download,"This review is about the audio book narrated by Eliza Voss. I both read and listened to ""Secret Life of Bees"" and enjoyed both. I have not yet read Mermaid's Chair but did listen to it narrated by Eliza Voss. I would not recommend the audio book at all. I felt that either Kidd decided to write a terrible book for a change or the narrator didn't do a good job in interpreting the writting. I found myself trying to imagine the words without the voice just to give Kidd the benefit of the doubt. If I had only experienced Kidd through this format I would write her off as a bestselling beach book writer. When I have the time I may try the actual book but I'm afraid the sing-songy perky dialogue will still be yammering in my head. I apologize to the narrator for being so harsh, it probably just wasn't the right fit."
1,Not recommended for farm land,"I had switched from the Spectracide bug stop to this on account of all the advertisement. Perhaps it works better in a suburb area but out here in the farm area I call home. No such luck. In fact, I would say it didn't do anything at all apart from waste my time. I continually had all sorts of bugs and critters finding their way into my home. This was never the case with the Spectracide 9-month product. Perhaps I did have to re-spray it every 6 or 7 months but I didn't have any bugs crawl into the house with that product. This Ortho one leaves me killing something nearly everyday!"
1,Have not received it as yet.,"As yet, have not received this. It's been nearly a month and no product. Perhaps I should cancel this sale or what?"
1,Nintendo 64 console with controller,I bought this as a gift for someone who used to have one years ago and wanted another. The console was in great shape but the controller was broken. So how is he supposed to to use it? The backward button doesn't work. Amazon should make sure that the sellers are trustworthy before connecting their name to them. VERY disappointing!!
1,toastmaster tcm4w,"Works pretty well and brews well, but is hard to take apart for cleaning. The shape of the coffee filter basket makes putting the paper cone in pretty difficult. In general; the construction is pretty cheep and I expect some part to fail every time I use it."
1,Horrible,"I agree with everything above. I can't believe how bad this thing is at staying together. I was going to put it in the box until my son was older, but then I saw it was a 2+ toy and he's already two. He likes the little Bob toy and Muck, but the storage thing together is useless, he keeps bringing me different doors to put back on and they don't stay!!! Save your money and get something else.If this wasn't a gift, I would have returned it as well."
1,Disapointed,"I had high hopes for this baby gate. With 5 children, I've tried more than I can remember. After my experiencew with this gate,I've realized that no presurized gate can stand up to the constant opening that happens in a busy family.This gate worked fine for the first few weeks, but within a month the rubber grips on the pressure mounts began pealing off. Once they were gone the gate slipped all over the door frame no matter how much pressure was on it. It also scratched up our woodwork. Lesson learned. I will use the wall mounts in the future.Another complaint is that there were no replacements parts readily available, and within a month I had to spend $33 to order them from the only place I could find online. The manufacturer is in Australia, and I could not find any contact info on the website to ask for replacement parts."
1,missing too many songs,"No ""You Are My Friend"", no ""If Only You Knew"", no ""Love, Need and Want You""- definitely NOT definitive!!"
1,Low rating on this book,"For those giving this book a poor rating, what I can say is you're not wrong but not right either. Because without certain degree of understanding of our being (not physical, but mental and spiritual), this book won't strike a chord!"
1,"Great content, but terrible value for money","We've recently bought a DVD player, mainly to get English-language educational material for our 2 year old (we live in Taiwan). Compared to some of the other DVDs/VCDs that we have bought, this one has great content; our boy is glued to it.However, the whole DVD from start to finish, is only 21 minutes long. This is a huge disappointment, as they could easily have fitted 3 episodes on the DVD (as ""Bear in the Blue House"" does). Also, no subtitles and no additional material at all. Really *very* poor value for money."
1,One great song and not much else,"This album contains a fantastic arrangement of the traditional song ""Polly on the Shore"", about a man pressed into service aboard a pirate ship. Other than that, this is a pretty tedious album. There are at least four songs that, no matter how many times I play the album, I can't remember anything about them a day later. The rest are uninspired and sound like outtakes from ""Angel Delight"". I would give this album one star, except that I've heard ""Gottle o' Geer"". ""Nine"" isn't aggressively bad like ""Gottle"", it's just bland.(1=poor 2=mediocre 3=pretty good 4=very good 5=phenomenal)"
1,Discovery Atlas Italy & Australia DOES NOT WORK,"I have done some researching online and found out that these 2 HD-DVDs have been recorded in a different way from the Brazil & China which do work. DO NOT ORDER this product until they have created a working batch. I have also spoken with Discovery Channel and they advised they are aware of the problem and are trying to get this problem resolved. I was advised to return the product from where I bought it and keep checking back with them. Be very cautious who you purchase this from. You dont want to order a defective title and then not be able to get your refund. The only ones working at this time as mentioned above is Brazil and China, you should be ok ordering those."
1,"Good Wipe, Bad Smell","I loved how well this wipe worked, but it smells so aweful! We ended up throwing away the wipes because they made me sick to my stomach everytime we changed our boys! If Pampers would change the sent, I'd really like these wipes!"
1,Worst movie ever,"I can't believe I had to watch this movie, but I'd paid so I stayed for the whole movie, we hated it and everyone around us said it was worst movie they'd ever seen. Don't waste your time or money on this movie"
1,The truth,Anyone can look up this guys history on the internet. I know him personally and I would not recommend the pages from this book for my dog to use.
1,It does not run in the family.,"I picked up the book because I read Anne Rice's books. Hit of miss, I pick her titles up in hard cover, as more often than not, they are enjoyable reads. When I found out her sister wrote a series of books, I thought I would give them a try. I did not expect them to be the same, I was just hoping for a good told tale.I was able to get 104 pages into the paperback version of this title before I gave up. I could not care about ""our heroine."" I kept hoping I would get some sense of a plot. I never did. I never got the direction the book was going in. It read to me as if the writer had an idea, but was allowed to go with a first draft.I don't usually give up on a book, but there were too many switchbacks in those 100 pages and I simply stopped caring about Regeane. It lacked ""something"" a story needs to hold a reader - that piece of a story, or mystery in a plot that makes you keep reading. I just felt like I was reading on a journey to nowhere."
1,Good Game!,"The game itself is absolutely fantastic! I am getting a lot of fun and enjoyment out of it! That was the reason I went out and searched for what is typically called an ""old school"" type of video game. However, the cartridge is a bit loose and I can hear an odd rattling sound out of the game case. I don't play it as much as I would like due to this rattling sound."
1,lasted right up until the warranty expired . . .,"This was a good unit for the first year after we bought it. I used it as a printer, scanner AND copier, and did quite nicely. But as soon as the warranty expired, the heads on the color cartridges clogged up and no amount of cleaning them could fix the problem. I spent quite a bit of money on all new cartridges, thinking that this might help. Nope. I just hate it when equipment implodes when the clock ticks one minute past warranty. The Epson people were helpful when I called them, but I still have to buy a new printer."
1,A Real Loser!,"I have owned two of these items; both manufactured by Tilia. Both failed miserably. The cost of returning them for repair is also prohibitive. I strongly recommend that you NOT BUY this product. Over the long run, you will be very disappointed with its performance.The system forces you to give it a star. Place a minus (-) before this one!"
1,High sounding but hollow.,"All Sound and Fury, SIGNIFYING NOTHING. A concotion of various Indian philosophies with a bad self induced, shortsighted vision."
1,Be Warned -- Major Disappointment!!!,"Wish I had paid more attention to the recent LOW reviews. Cheap and nearly laughable product. The attachments are like toys instead of tools. Sure it is cheap; but if it lasts a year, I will be very surprised. It is so disappointing I do not even plan to send it back. I will use it as long as it will work then send it where all junk should go. You have been warned."
1,Almost wonderful...,"This band really has what it takes to perform beautiful and gloomy music, but the machine-gun speed-metal drumming that they insist on inserting into every song ruins the whole thing."
1,Will not Autofocus,"This lens will not autofocus under any circumstance at all. I returned it thinking it wasn't working properly. I knew that it wouldn't autofocus in dim light situations, but from what i had read bright light situations should have been ok. I was buying it to use on my Canon Rebel T3i. I have 2 Tamron lenses, both brand new to use it with.The camera store that shipped the order for Amazon called me and explained that the teleconverter adds to f stops the the lens you are adding this to. I was told this teleconverter would never autofocus on any lens in any condition ever. I had tried different settings, in different lighting situations and found that it would not autofocus ever.This information isn't mentioned anywhere on the Tamron website. It isn't mentioned in any reviews anywhere."
1,Doesn't last long,"Bought one of these just a little over 2 years ago, and the thing is now dead.Had trouble with it when I first got it. The batteries were woefully underpowered. Had to buy a pair of 2000mAh nickel-hydride batteries to get decent light and life out of the thing at night. The batteries that were in it were ancient (cheap) 900mAh ni-cads.It worked well for one summer, and degraded slowly this summer. I bring the thing inside and open the battery compartment thinking batteries needed replacing. Nope. The whole thing was rusted on the inside and water trickled out. Its not like I had it under water. It stood in mulch at the edge of an island in my yard.I've sent email complaining to Intermatic/Malibu about their poor weatherproofing.**UPDATE** A replacement unit is being sent. We'll see how this one goes."
1,Predictable,"Slow moving, predictable. If you find a lot of gore entertaining, then you will enjoy this flick. You have to be quite fluent in Australian tongue to understand the conversations amongst the cast - very thick accents, found myself only getting bits and pieces of what they were saying. I was rather disappointed in the film overall."
1,Wake me up when it's over,"I absolutely hated this movie! The whole movie was a waste of time. All they do is go through the jungle in search of some diamonds for a telephone company...laser?? You didn't even see the flesh-eating...gorillas until the end of the movie, and the people, very predictably I may say, were caught in a situation that they couldn't possibly get out of, but something saves them, but still adds to the danger. OK, I'll give them this, a volcanic eruption saving them was the last thing on my mind. And what's with the talking gorilla? It did nothing in the film except annoy you and say stupid things."
1,No Good from the Beginning,"I bought some of these with the recharger, and one of the batteries was bad almost immediately. It would not take a charge, and I was getting ""null"" on the display. Soon after 2 more died.These are the worse rechargable batteries I've ever used. Save your money1 buck per pack would be too much."
1,Watch did not last long,Wore this watch only a month or so & it stopped working. Have payed less then this before for a Timex & they have run for years.Sharon
1,Doesn't fit my Auto-Ordnance M1,"Doesn't fit my Auto-Ordnance M1. It's about 1/8 inch to long. It's also a little to wide on one end and doesn't rest on top of the stock, it slides down over the wood."
1,Don't make the $50 mistake.,"Learn from my mistake and do not buy this game! Like the other reviewers stated, this game is highly bugged and should not have even been released. Some people were lucky enough to be able to play this game (albeit with random crashes). I was not one of those people. I couldn't even get the game installed because of a conflict between the graphics card driver and the software. Despite me uninstalling and reinstalling the game and my drivers numerous times (per the manufacturer's instructions), I just could not get this to work.Unfortunatly for me, I bought this at a Target store and because it was open, I could not exchange this game, despite its numerous known problems.If you don't believe me about the problems this game has, look on this page and Ebay and see how many people are selling the game having been opened once."
1,Cuidado: Lacks critical sections,"Hopefully the new version of this book is more complete than the last edition. The worst part was that there was no CD or tape for the listening sections. The students had to simply read them instead of hearing them or get someone!?!? to say them aloud. There was no practice at all for some of the sections that were on the test. I had to go to another book to find practice exercises for the missing sections. Students did like the explanations in the back of the book and usually did not need further help from me, but there are much better review books out there."
1,Mixed Feelings,"Waiting a few years for the Gang to come out with some new stuff. Only to have a 12 track album with only about 8 true songs. Is kinda disapointing. Since my first listin of the Gang back in 96 with FireWaterBure on the radio I was hooked. Then Hooray comes along and blew my mind away. There first cd Use your fingers is just all over the place, but it was there first album, but its a classic in its own way. But Hefty Fine is just something so far outa reach, I cry for have waiting this long for something so lacking."
1,Simplistic Drivel,"This is a terrible book. In fact, most of the books by this publisher -- ISTE -- are obvious vanity press offerings. If you are interested in technology in education, there are many titles produced by other publishers that are written, edited and produced professionally."
1,not her best work,"i returned this book the day i got it. i'm glad i got my money back. atleast borrow THIS book from a library, because you know that you can return it, without wasting your money. the best part of the book was the ending, with the roses. that was about it."
1,Stop working after 60 days,I installed the speakers outdoors. They worked good for about 60 days. I have them in the flower beads next to the hot tube. They look great. But after 60 days of weather they just stop working. No return or refund after 30 days. Waste of $65.00.
1,not as promised,This was suppose to work on windows 7.....DID NOT!! I had an older version on windows XP and it was awesome. Was very disappointed that I could not work with this program again!!
1,Not as good as I thought it would be...,"With tons of books covering HTML it is difficult to find the right one. Because I was building a web site for the company I work at I wanted to ensure I had all the angles covered, so I bought several web publishing books. One was HTML: The definitive guide. As a programmer who was really familiar with the O'Reilley UNIX books, I figured this book would be just as good. Unfortunately the Nutshell approach just doesn't work for Web technologies like it does for UNIX books. The droning dictionary style and subdued tone put me to sleep. The book is also overpriced compared to other books of similar length"
1,Surprise! Surprise! Surprise!,I am very dissapointed with this book. I am still in a state of awe! It nothing more than a comic book and it is priced way too high.I will be returning it!I must be more careful in selecting!mwh
1,Just ok,"This book is just OK - very dry and not very visually appealing. Very sparse. Probably better for adult who wants to expand their current training program, but did not interest teens."
1,Propet Slip-on,"This is a nice shoe, but it is loose-fitting in the standard size I wear. A slip-on needs a firmer fit in order not to slip on the feet."
1,Broken.,"I bought this at a store and it has never worked. Literally I bought it a store,took it out of the box and placed the batteries in the machine and it did not work. Stay away from this product."
1,Don't waste your money,"This book has a fairly interesting concept - the idea of faking a pregnancy because of the perks of being pregnant - but the author fails miserably in pulling it off. The plot is very poorly developed, the details unbelievable. And the ending includes a gratingly convenient deus ex machina that, frankly, just seems lazy.Also, the main character is supposed to be a native englishwoman, living in london, and yet she speaks and thinks in american language (eg, calling a painkiller ""Tylenol"" when every english person knows it as ""Paracetamol""). I find this extremely irritating.And the idea that anyone could fool all their friends, family and co-workers with the sort of ridiculous lies and tricks that this woman comes up with is just preposterous.Seriously, this book isn't worth your time or your money. I strongly discourage you from buying it.I'd give it zero stars if I could."
1,Did you see the Video?,"If you saw the video, don't bother with the book. Or vise versa. The book is just the same content as the video in text form. I was expecting more information, thought it would go deeper into each topic, but it's exactly like the video...It reminded me of those books with a read along tape kids have.If you're looking for more content, look to a different author. If you want a quick reference guide, then this is the one for you."
1,Tina,"There is a big air leaking problem of this product. Even we followed the right way to fill in air for a couple of times, still not working. My back was hurting in the morning after waking up. Do not buy!!"
1,Disappointed,"I got this to use in my classroom for stamps and for creating art with finger prints. The pad is very dry. I can't even get a regular stamp to show up on the paper when using it. The colors are so faint, and don't coat the stamps. I am so disappointed. A complete waste of my money."
1,Entertainment for the drug crowd,"I received this book in the mail, why I have no idea. I think this book is serious - seriously funny to any person even partially grounded in reality. Who knew Venusians where physically identical - if only we had their secret to all being same size and weight! Maybe it's the lack of fornication?? It's a good thing only Venusians can order their food without moving their lips - you thought Americans were obese now? But if nothing else, practitioners of his astral projection skills will get lots of exercise jumping up and down to see if they are in their astral bodies or not. I suspect the true believers never land on solid earth..."
1,An hour and a half of your life that you'll NEVER get back!!,"This is the WORST movie ever. Even though Eliza Dushku is hot, the movie is terrible. Bad story, bad acting, bad special effects, it's just bad. Go out and get Dawn of the Dead, now!"

1,Why is there reference to demonic acts in a book for kids?,"My son enjoyed reading the first two books by JK Rowling. Unfortunately, he was not able to finish reading the third book after I read the chapter that dealt with reading tea leaves. The mention that only ""special"" people could interpret the information was way too close to demonic behavior for me. Isn't there someone who can right interesting stories without delving into demonic acts and the occult?"
1,watch the grass grow,"I felt this had a slow-moving plot. It took a long time to unwind and then had a rapid wrap-up. Suddenly everything was resolved and the film was over. I was very disappointed with that. I was never particularly interested in the storyline either. I did like the narrative from the girl's perspective and it was...sweet, but overall it was flat and clumsy. You can find many things better to watch than this. You will not have missed much by skipping this one."
1,Disappointing,"I am a huge Rice fan and I was really disappointed by this book. There were plenty of interesting elements in this story, but she didn't seem to bring them together. Possibly the frequent references to other books and storylines?The character of Merrick is an interesting addition to her lineup but I don't feel she capitalized on it.It is still worth reading if you are a Rice fan, but not by much."
1,A quick picker-upper,This lite little sweeper picks up very well but the battery runs down very quickly within three minutes. I would not buy this product again.
1,Installation Problems Prevent a Review...,"I would love to review Adobe InDesign CS3, but I can't get the program to install on my new Vista system. Adobe technical support requested that I send them a conguration file, but its been almost a week and I haven't received a call back. Having used PageMaker for years, I look forward to using InDesign, but Adobe obviously needs to make some improvements."
1,Most reviewers must B FAKE S**T R(each) N(o) B(oundaries) hustlers,"Took this one, having in mind how decent was ""the listening"" Little brother's album and reading Amazon reviewers testimonies..ABSOLUTELY overrated, overproduced, overgrounded POP/RNB sheet.Clumsy beats, insipid lyrics, pityful emcees/feats..At miles away from any ATCQ or any summertime-like true school...Connect this one to your garbage..."
1,"Yea, I don't know bout this one","I typically don't write reviews, due to the fact of, books are meant to be read without personal bias going into it, but rather letting the author make his/her case. Regardless if you agree with Hagee or not, the question MUST be asked...who in the HELL uses wikipedia as its primary source for information...Oh, that's right, John Hagee. If you turn to page 245 and read through 256 you will find most of his resources are secondary in nature and not primary. He cites wikipedia some 7 times on page 246. If I could give a no star I would. I have the 2007, ""Revised and Updated"" version. As a reader I was greatly offended and disgusted that I spent money on something that is most likely fabricated in nature. FIRST rule of research is FIND the PRIMARY source JOHN!!!!If you still want to read it just go to wikipedia. I'm sure you will eventually stumble across some of what Hagee did too."
1,watch out for this!!,"I want to start by saying that i have no idea what kind of workout this is, other than a review on video fitness forums.The reviews are fishy. If you look under the review, there will be something that says ""amazon verified purchase"" meaning they bought it from here. Not one of the reviews had that which makes me nervous to trust these reviews.Again i dont have any idea how the workout is, just trying to help others."
1,not so good,"The cuts are not without merit, CD is only 21 min. long. The band sounds like so many others. If you follow this band by all means buy it, but I like more content in a CD. Lots of great bands out there, i would pick something else rather than this"
1,Pass on this opener. Not worth it.,Bought this opener in late January. 8 months later it no longer works. Thought it was the battery so I replaced it. Still didn't work! I guess it's true: you get what you pay for. Next time I'll refrain from ordering a product from a company just because it is the cheapest. Very disappointed!
1,tug of war,The music is Okee but i didn't receive the special edition shows in the pictures seen under cover.the original cover of the LP in CD format is shown in these pictures.So iám not fully satisfied.Greetings Bart van Lent
1,Don't waste your time or money on this,"There's nothing worse than having to listen to someone who thinks they're funny (or even worse, cute) and they're not. If you met this guy at a party, you would roll your eyes and move on. This guy is like a dime-store Rich Lewis. Let's put it this way, one of the worse mistakes I made during the 90's was NOT walking out on this movie. When it was over, I felt like I had just wasted two hours of my life. Nuff said?"
1,"waste of talent, time, and money","I had the unfortunate experience of spending money at Blockbuster and renting this dud. With such big name stars, I expected at least a mildly entertaining movie. What I got was one hour of lifeless, drab, big-budget flick. I couldn't bear to watch another minute, thus ""Tequila Sunrise"" became the first rental I stopped watching since that fateful day I rented ""Last Action Hero"". The actors seem to be stumbling through their scenes, lending not one iota of believability to their characters. I'm sure Michelle Pfeiffer, Mel Gibson, and Kurt Russell all look at this horrendous piece of garbage as the down point of their careers. I hope the actors had fun making this production; I sure as heck didn't have any fun watching it."
1,Dissatisfied,The first day I used it the plastic covering broke I don't recommend this to anyone I had one before and I did not have a problem with it. But this one doesn't seem as sturdy as the last.
1,Working Class Canterbury Tales?,I found the constant change from character to character and from time frame to time frame made the story difficult to get into. Whatever humor there was in this story escapes me. What a very sad commentary on the family relationships of the characters. Only two seemed to have any satisfaction in their lives. Depressing at best. The fact that I needed to read this for a book club discussion is the only thing that caused me to persevere to the end.
1,Difficult to navigate,"Although this may be a good marketing book for writers, I found the lack of professional typesetting bothersome: using lines of hyphens between entries, instead of subject headers or bullets; using bold AND italics for book titles are just a few problems. But the biggest error is that there is no index in the back of the book. A book such as this begs for a lengthy index of author's names, subject headers, book titles, etc. I found it frustrating trying to navigate through this hodge podge of advice."
1,SNOOZE....BORING....BLAH,This book was incredibly boring. Susie dies and looks down upon her incredibly boring life. Yawn. I could not care less about any of the characters. I absolutely could not believe my eyes reading all the praises stamped all over the book. Were they reading the same book as I was?
1,"Returned item, wasn't blue tooth","I ordered this keyboard/mouse combo and it turned out to not be blue tooth, so I returned it. I'm sure it would have been great if I had used it but my Mac has blue tooth and I thought I was getting a blue tooth kbd and mouse.I got an apple blue tooth keyboard instead and I found a logitech blue tooth mouse, which I also got. (Apple doesn't offer a decent blue tooth 2 button mouse in anything like an acceptably reasonable price range)."
1,It works on some people,This product does work on some people. I think really skinny people. Of which I am not. I did pull out a chunk of hairs on the one area I could pull really taught and they didn't grow back for months. The rest if my legs sadly just stayed sticky.
1,The $30 Cost of This Book Would Be Better Spent on Your Family Doctor's Co-Pay,"More refuse in book form from the uneducated, felony convicted, infomerical king, Kevin Trudeau."
1,boring,"To me this movie was boring-sure not worth buying-which I did before previewing it, lesson learned, I will in the future preview first,,,sally"
1,Christmas Disappointment,My 4 year old daughter was so excited to get this from her grandma and grandpa for Christmas--the cd player never worked only the disco lights. Thankfully she had enough other stuff to keep her busy. Grandma felt awful. Toys'R'Us needs to pull this until it can guarentee a working product.
1,I Was Robbed!,What I thought I was getting:A new and up-to-date view of Pre-Columbian cultures in the AmericasWhat I got:20% Pre-Columbian cultures40% history of Conquest and Post-Conquest Americas40% incessant anti-European screedI haven't seen such blatantly false advertising since Beyonce showed up on TV sporting a 3-foot-long weave and claiming she colored it with L'Oreal! I want my money back!
1,Good idea,"bad implementation. Everytime I store a bottle of wine I need to use a new gas cilinder, not very cost effective in my opinion, unless you are keeping an expensive wine.I like how the bottles are displayed, though."
1,Too expensive for its poor quality,"I just got this item in mail as my little girl is expecting this from Santa. Xmas is only a few days away and I cannot even imagine going to another store looking for an alternate. I really wished that I would like this item but as soon as I opened the box, I couldn't help but be stunned with a disappointment. It is poorly made with poor quality thin fabric. If my daughter runs around in this item, I won't be surprised to see it ripped. The first thing came to my mind was that it is probably worth only about $15 the max. I paid $29.99 at Amazon. Anyhow, I don't want to let my girl down so I guess we are keeping this for Xmas. I am so unhappy with the quality that I am secretly hoping that my girl would dislike it so that I can return it right after Xmas. I know that this sounds terrible but for those who are considering this item, hope this review helps. The sad thing is that I couldn't find any other better looking items in the similar price range."
1,Worst dance workout,Absolutely no sweat and no fun. This video is not a good dance workout or even a good dance intructional video. I will never buy a dance workout again.
1,I tried and tried and tried...,"..to like this, I really did. These guys are truly great but there are just very few real songs here. The playing is impeccable and I like the intstrumentals, but where is the melody? The best Rush tunes at least had some semblance of melody, but now that Geddy sings with little of the range he once had, the vocal lines are just straight and flat.50 percent of this is pretty good, the other half, well, it's boring."
1,Good rhetoric. Bad Science. Poor investment.,"Some of the most expensive toilet paper I ever bought for my dog. Politicians are this self promoting. Patent medicine salesmen have an equal grasp of science. Do yourself a favor, get Open Boundaries."
1,"Goes off all the time, can not filter out regular storms","If you want a radio that will go off for any basic storm then you will love this one. I live in florida and wanted a radio that would let me know if a tornado is in the area. This radio will do that, but it will also tell you when there is a thunderstorm(which we get all the time). After bieng woken up in the middle of the night 3-4 times over a single week period for thunderstorms, I unplugged it and put it away. No idea why they would not provide an ability to filter out certain warnings, but this device is useless.Contacted tech support from midland about this, and never get got a reply. I see how on the website it does state this model can not select to warn on only certain messages.Look for another model if you do not like to be woken up for regular storms."
1,OH OH.....,"Kevin Costner is a grieving widower who believes his deceased wife is trying to contact him. Supernatural drama from the director of Patch Adams is pretty dull and silly in excution, with some good ideas but mostly poorly excuted. The finale is surprisingly pretty good, with a twist ending that actually worksm but can't make up for everything else that's so lackuster. Costner's okay here, acting the same way he usually does in all his films."
1,Saw it on youtube. Pass it.,"Saw the full thing on youtube movies, It's horrible, really bad, I wish I can give it a less than zero Rating. Horrible Cheesy Dubbed In English, Spanish Film. Least scariest vampires ever. Not worthy of buying or renting. Thank God I saw it for free."
1,Doesn't even rate one full star.,"I was truly shocked by how bad this book is. Mr. Patterson evokes no suspense, his characters are one-dimensional, the plot is just plain silly. Perhaps a more talented writer could have done something creative with this premise.The book reads like it was written by a thirteen year old girl for other thirteen year old girls. I suffered through 148 pages hoping the writing would get better, skimmed through a few more pages, and finally decided not to waste any more time trying to be entertained by this piece of trash."
1,Poor Quality control,"I love this show dearly, but this DVD set does NOT do it justice. I've repeatedly had problems with discs that freeze. Amazon has been kind enough to send replacement sets, but the problem persists. It's NOT Amazon's fault, they've bent over backward to accomadate me and I appreciate it. The fault lies with whoever failed to do a quality review check on these discs. I've never had this happen before and I am greatly disappointed that Fox flubbed it so badly. Time Tunnel was in the same two sided format and it's OK, absoltely no problem with that series or Volume 1 on Voyage. I'm just so saddened by the poor quality control!"
1,Take too long to ship,"I've been reading about this Carlos Chiu paddle form these reviews, and finally design to buyone, I am using Pan Asia rubber paddle thatI bough 8 years a go, resently I start to go to a Ping pong Club, and play again. I lost to every one of them, and they laugh at whan they seen my paddle because it too slip, and have no sticky on my Pan Asia. As I oder I wanted to get my Paddle in about 5-6 days for free shipping, and as show on Amazon llc co. I oderes 5-28-08, and just check the order confirm to ship on June 19 to july 6 Wow that not what it say on the advetising.I am up set about the service, I can't review the Paddle because I don't have it yet. Becare full whn you order. I giving only one star for the services"
1,Not what I expected,"From the description, I expected a light, fun, get-me-in-the-Christmas-spirit book. It started out promising, but went downhill from there. In a matter of a few days, Lauren went from being wary and not trusting men to being completely in love and in bed with Kyle (with her daughter in the next room). The book dragged for me and wasn't hard to put down at all. In fact, I didn't finish it and deleted it from my Kindle. I love romantic happy endings so this one should have been a homerun, but it was a bit too trashy for my taste."
1,Not what I expected,"I can't rate this product with even one star! I received my product and some of the brackets were bent, broken, uneven and I felt as thought something that should've taken about 10 min. to put together took too long. I spent too much time trying to ensure that this piece was together correctly I finally got fed up, left it alone and then came back to it. How do you sell someone something that has pieces messed up and tell the person that it's brand new. I don't believe this was new as the instructions were missing from the box upon my long awaited receipt of the cage. I ordered on December 5 and didn't receive until December 23, why doesn't it take 2 weeks for something like this to arrive but it only takes 10 seconds to verify and retrieve the funds from a credit card? Don't buy it, it's not worth it! Go to a store and get one!Brand New Bird Cage Cages 18x14x46 With Stand 5894Blk/S"
1,?,"I purchased the book to gain knowlege but it just did not fill the bill. As a spiritual minister the information was just not there. No real knowlege of anything. I believe that only J.J. is the one that will receive this knowledge. I purchased his DVD's and again, the same question, I asked myself, what am I watching?"
1,Mouse Sucks!,i gave it a 2 star beacuse the keybord is good. well the keybord goes through batteries like water and sometimes gets stuck. oh but the mouse ughh. it is the worst i have ever seen. it is soo slow. when i move the mouse it takes like 2 seconds to process and move. thats a long time when you are trying to do something fast or play a game. i would recomend you to spend your money on a better one believe me your not missing out on anything.
1,Didn't work,I received the Motorola T305 after reading the positive reviews on it. I started using it and it seemed to work well and then people kept telling me they couldn't hear me. I adjusted the volume and that seemed to help and then they said it all sounded garbled. I even called my house to leave a message to hear what it sounded like. I connected my phone to my gps and that worked fine so I knew it was the bluetooth that wasn't working. I was very disappointed because I thought it would work well.
1,"Trust me, this is a cheap mobile","I bought this because it looked really cute in the box. Once you take it out of the box, it is very cheap looking. The arm that swings out is an awful color green, and the fish fall of. Plus it eats batteries, the final straw is the motor stopped turning after 1 month. It is just stupid, although my baby did like it, but I think he likes anything that he can watch.It is very cheap, do not waste your money. If you do decide to try it keep the receipt."
1,Worthless trinket!!,"The alarm is a virtually useless trinket. Reflection from the sun inside the backup light consistently sets off the alarm most of the day except from about 10am to 2pm. Purchase is a complete waste of money. The alarm is a worthless dollar shop trinket! ""Buyer beware!!"""""
1,Misrepresentation,Nowhere in the description was it stated that the 'rich walnut finish' was actually plastic. Feel they should refund all shipping charges to and from customer when item is returned.
1,"Dear People, Please Read This.","I would pleasely & kindly tell y'all that, THIS GAME IS A CURSE, GET RID OF IT AS POSSIBLE. THIS GAME STINKS, YOU CAN'T DO A DAMN THING IN THIS SO-CALLED MASTERPIECE, ITS DISASTERPIECE IN MY POINT OF VIEW.GRAB THE VIDEO GAME. (...)"
1,Breaks fast!,"Got one of these a couple of months ago, after about 20-25 uses, the part that does the mixing/chopping broke. To be more accurate, the black part on the bottom of the container that is turned to perform it's chopping action striped out the very short machine threads that hold it onto the blades.Forget about parts."
1,Not worth the price,"I had high hopes for this mattress pad. It started out wonderful, but after a short time, the material traveled into the other squares. This left the sections directly under where we sleep without any stuffing, and all around us padded nicely with the comfy gel insides. We've tried throwing it in the dryer on the air setting with tennis balls to ""punch"" it around, but it hasn't really helped. I wouldn't have purchased this mattress pad if I had known about these results. I think the next time we purchase something like this, we'll try a memory foam mattress pad, of which we've heard much better reviews."
1,This is not the told edition,I needed this book for school and it end up with a different edition. You should please check the information and the stocks so this problem can be solvedThanks
1,Fun While It Lasted,"I had mine exactly a year and two days when I got the red ring of death. I found out that 3 out of 10 Xbocx360's made durring the time of October-November 2005 had the life span of about a year...just right after the warranty ends. Now I have a $399.99 paper weight. Isn't that nice?I understand that they have extended this warranty, but what about the rest of us?My advice? Find out the manufacture date, if you can, before you buy it."
1,"Lather, Rinse, Repeat, & Repeat, & Repeat...","I don't normally leave book reviews, but I was forced into reading this for my journalism class and it was an utter waste of my time. If you know anything about writing and advertising - that is, if you have ever read a magazine or seen an ad on the side of a bus - you should already know the things that are written in this book. It is mostly all just common sense. And every single point made in the book was said at least 162 times over and over and over and over - and not even in a new and interesting way! It was so frustrating, my blood pressure rises just thinking about it. Do yourself a favor and avoid this book, get the cliff notes if you can - the points they make are relevant, just way too obvious, and they are SO OFTEN repeated that someone out there must have caught on and compacted the main points down to something with more readability to it.... Sorry for the negativity, but I hate when my time is wasted."
1,Oh my God! do not watch this film!,"Please save yourself the pain I had to suffer watching this piece of tripe. Awful, just awful! The cover is the best bit!"
1,"By turns wierd (and not in a good way), frustrating, and boring","I have a hard time understanding how anyone could say that the characters in this book are well developed...that was one of the things that frustrated me the most: I kept wondering how a character got from point A to point B, and I couldn't picture several of the characters (especially the Emerson kids) separately in my head.To me the ultimate sign of how this book didn't capture my full interest was that on a plane I read almost to the end before I had to close it to deplane...and it was days later before I realized that I hadn't actually finished the book.Ultimately unsatisfying."
1,Don't be misled by 3.5 stars,"I thought 3.5 stars weren't bad, given how many reviews there were. I was dead wrong. The set I received was poorly packaged (by AMAZON!) and one of the feet was assembled off-center. Worst part, the chips inside were not close to what was pictured on Amazon. Yes, you get white, red, green and black; however the white portions of ALL chips were a drab, grayish color. I have a travel set on-hand to compare with, and the whites were night and day. The dice imprint was off the mark in many cases, and the chips themselves appeared to be of poor quality. You will be very disappointed if you order these. I immediately re-boxed and returned."
1,FOR THE REAL TEMPTATION FANS,"THE 25TH ANNIVERSARY MUSIC WAS GREAT,BUT THE TEMPTS HAVE A ALBUM CALLED THE TEMPTATIONS LIVE AT LONDONS, TALK OF THE TOWN.IT HAS EDDIE, DENNIS, PAUL, MELVIN, & OTIS,ON STAGE DOING ALL THE GREAT TEMPTATION SONGS ,WITH STRONG LEAD VOCALS AND THEIR BEAUTIFUL BACKGROUND HARMONYS. ALSO THEY HAVE AN CD CALLED THE ANTHOLOGY WHICH HAS 46 TEMPTATION HITS. IT IS VERY VERY GOOD, IT ALSO HAS SOME LIVE RECORDINGS ON IT.I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS CD TO ALL TEMPTATION LOVERS. IF YOU DON'T HAVE THEM TRY TO FIND THEM.IT WILL BE WORTH THE SEARCH.ONE MORE THING THE TEMPTATIONS HAVE A CD CALLED 25TH ANNIVERSARY WHICH IS ANOTHER GREAT GREAT COLLECTIONFIND THEM ALL IF YOU CAN."
1,be prepared...,"novell ipx users? skip this. they dont pass ipx...in my office of like 50' away from the linksys pcmcia card? good reception. outside the walls? [not good]. granted i have about a foot of stucco walls. another test. i covered the antenna part of the card in the laptop. still about 20' away from the base unit. the signal drop by almost to 50-60%.so i stuck the unit by a window on the second floor. then i walked outside. 1500'??? not even close...so when you get this, open it and use it immediately. i waited to receive the pcmcia unit from another place and my 30 days return policy ran out.if you keep it, upgrade the firmware of the unit immediately. on mine, the WEP did not work at all with its own card for the laptop until i made the change... kinda sad...again, novell users, unless you upgrade to pure IP... stay away from this..."
1,Last Precinct is the Last good novel,"Kay Scarpetta's last good adventure was ""The Last Precinct"".Bringing Benton back........... BIG MISTAKE, reminded me of how they brought back Bobby on ""Dallas"".Worse, when it was written in first person, She WAS the character.The whole series has ground to a halt. From Body Farm to Last Precinct, it's a GREAT Series........ since then, a waste of time"
1,Disappointed,"I ordered these to wear at my niece's wedding. I was so happy to see the box waiting at my door. Unfortunately, when I opened the jewelry box to look at my new pearls, what I saw was not the purple strand I had ordered and expected, but a sandy/peach strand. It's a beautiful necklace, and I'll probably give them to my mother for Christmas, but I was wanting purple to go with my chosen outfit."
1,EPIC FAIL! NNNooooooooooooooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!,"There have already been some excelent reviews written in the 1 Star section that I have neither the energy or motivation to emulate. Compare the 1 Star reviews to those who gave it 5 Stars (""Star Wars is Cool!"") and you will see who the real fans are.Lucasfilm has once again slapped the fans in the face. The changed Krayt dragon call, the pink Lightsaber and worse of all the Darth Vader screaming Noooooooo!!!!!!!!!!! is pathetic. Oh, by the way... it seems that the HUGE outcry from Fans for the past 15 years over the Greedo / Han incident meant nothing to Lucas. Yes, Greedo STILL Shoots first!So George, keep your Cash Cow to yourself. I Cancelled my pre-order."
1,Don't waste your money,"We thought we'd try these remanufactured cartridges because they cost so much less than the originals. We found out why they were so cheap. They lasted for about 20 pages and then the printer quick working because of a ""cartridge error."" We had to go to Office Depot and get new ones."
1,Review for Aliph Jawbine Noise Shield Bluetooth Headset,The earpiece didn't fit my ear as I thought it would. Very big and I wanted something a bit smaller.
1,Difficult to Learn,"I bought Tracy Andersons Mat and cardio dvd's and found the cardio dance routine to be pretty difficult to learn. I am not new to working out, I have been using The Firm for twenty-five years with great success.But due to bad knees I have been looking for a good alternate. I am not a dancer and have had a difficult time learning the routines. I only have an hour a day to work out, so it's frustrating that it is taking so long. I feel like I am not getting a solid cardio workout and usually stop to do something else.I do think if I could actually learn it more quickly, it would really give a great workout! So, if you are a dancer, give this a try. I think you will love it. If your not a dancer...be ready to spend a lot of time learning this."
1,Too weird for words,"I have only been able to sit through this film once. I picked it up because I saw that Gary Oldman was in it, but I couldn't make heads or tails of the characters or plot. Apparantly, there's an unhappily married woman (Theresa Russell) who keeps fantasizing that the son she gave up for adoption has come looking for her. He appears in the form of Oldman, but he acts like a bratty three year old, and the sequences involving him and Russell are just too odd to explain. And then there's her husband (Christopher Lloyd), who has this weird fascination with trains and masochism...but that's a different story. The ending makes no sense, but then, the whole movie makes no sense so I guess it doesn't matter."
1,Handles are floppy,"This seems to be the same as the ES 499R in yellow. Both have floppy handles. There are a couple of ways to get around the floppy handles. One is to use popsicle sticks jammed into the handle, suggested by someone who bought the ES 499R. Another is to use dowels. 9/16"" must be the perfect size. 5/8"" is impossible; 1/2"" is too small and the dowels don't stay put.If you can sew and want to go to the trouble, you can get some webbing and a green xertube. Take the solid handle off the green one, cut the handle on the yellow one, switch handles, and use the extra webbing to repair the handles on the yellow xertube.At this point, I don't know anything about the durability of this xertube."
1,My Head Did a 360...,"Not what I expected after reading ""The Exorcist"". This book features the befuddled Detective Kinderman. Jeez Louise! I could not read one page without going back and scratching my head. Kinderman's ridiculous, annoying and totally useless musings ruined what I guess could have been a good book - couldn't make it past 30 pages. Lose Kinderman and this book would have been about 50 pages long."
1,should of known..,"I made the mistake of watching this based on a whim--with Ralph Fiennes, whom I absolutely adore, and the lovely Keira Knightley starring, I had expected to love it--Now don't get me wrong, the actors were excellent, but the sheer brutality of the story made it unbearable to watch. Needless to say, I won't be watching this movie again."
1,Who is buying this?,"I noticed that the Sales Rank on this garbage is very low, meaning a LOT of people are buying it. What I want to know is who are these gullible and naive boneheads?$350 for five hours of extra material, no 3D on ALL movies, no Extended Versions on ALL movies, a bunch of useless DVDs that most of us already own to make it look like a larger set than it truly is, and I could go on. AYFKM? That is utterly ridiculous!!!This is blatant disregard and a kick in the rear with our backs turned for HP fans everywhere. This is greed at its corporate finest!I have waited a LONG time to purchase the BDs of HP as one big collection, and this is how I am rewarded for my patience?STOP PRE-ORDERING THIS GARBAGE, PEOPLE, SO WARNER BROS. GETS THE MESSAGE THAT WE WON'T BE DEFRAUDED!!! STOP!!! STOP!!! STOP!!!"
1,Not as useful as her podcasts,"I got interested in buying the book after listening to her ""Dear Jane"" podcasts. Unfortunately, the book was much less useful than her casts would lead you to believe. The podcasts are more useful than the book, and FREE!Look for David Burns and his 10 Days to Self Esteem book sets for some real help. There is also Break the Chains of Low Self Esteem (cannot remember author's name). These books have been immensely more helpful in dealing with my depression and related low self esteem.I don't even think I'd recommend Enough is Enough for anyone who is further along in her/his recovery process. Just not helpful. Lots of platitudes, but no real skill building exercises.Best of luck in whatever you choose on your road to recovery!"
1,Save Your Money!!!!,"I bought this for my 4 year old daughther after she begged me for it for months. I thought the price was a little high but I bought it as a Xmas present.She was so disappointed when she opened the box and the only furniture included was a couch, Dora and Doras Mom and Dad. Therefore, she has only played with it a couple of times in the past year. We do have Loving Family Doll House furniture that would work with it, but it just isn't the same from her point of view. I did look at purchasing additional Dora furniture and the rest of the characters, Boots, Swiper, Diego, etc., but not only are the items impossible to find, but if you can find them they too are overpriced.Save your money!!"
1,"Poorly Written, Bad Maps","This guide does not come close to comparing with Lonely Planet. It is poorly written and gives little or no information about museums and city sites other than their address and hours of operation. The map is also poorly done and it is difficult to use in locating restaurants and museums. Buenos Aires is an amazing city so I suggest buying a worthy guide book, not this one."
1,Don't Purchase It....Purchase It From A Store.,"The box was a mess when it arrived, including the styrofoam on the inside. The chrome was chipped and it is significantly smaller than you think. If you are lucky, your child can ride it until they are 4-5, not until they are seven as the box suggests. This is the type of toy you should see in a store so I do not recommend the online purchase. Our son is 3 1/2 and was deeply disappointed with the toy. To boot, there are fuses that were shot when the toy arrived and our son was never able to ride it. What a tremendous disappointment at Christmas."
1,The author does not present contemporary C++.,"Very little of the code in this book is written according to the ISO C++ Standard. The author seems to have learned by experimentation, and makes basic mistakes. Fundamental parts of contemporary C++ (such as namespaces) are not covered (well, the one allusion to namespaces dismisses them as an annoying quirk of modern compilers).Your money would be best spend elsewhere."
1,Nice idea but terrible product,Thought these would be a great alternative to the paper and styrofoam cup we go through. Turned out to be flimsy and the lip of the cups are rough. Definitely would not recommend this product.
1,BUY THE VHS INSTEAD!!!! DEFECTIVE PRODUCT!!!!!,"I used to own this on VHS, and loved it. When I saw it was available on DVD I snagged it.The sound drops out two or three times, on several tracks, which is infuriating enough. But my copy goes back to the main menu after each song!!! There are also several little glitches in the video.I just got this today, and have only spent ten frustrating minutes with this disc. They were bad enough to prompt me to write this review.Now, the show itself is classic puppy, and the songs are great. Ogre's performance is just plain scary. This would be the perfect video to play at your next church function or children's birthday party.But just take into consideration. Nettwerk is ripping you off, and the band off with this inferior and quite defective disc."
1,Ridiculous Rochester,"I love the book and the 1983 adaptation with Dalton and Clarke is my favorite. I told my husband years back (then just a bf) how much I love the book and movie and he gifted me this without knowing anything about different versions out there. I was not even aware of this adaptation myself back then and was curious to see what this Jane Eyre had to offer. I was horried to witness Ciaran Hinds screeching and screaming all the time like he was having a never-ending PMS. And let me just say I love Ciaran Hinds. He is a truly talented actor, amazing in Persuasion and Phantom of the Opera, not a one-note actor by any means. I dont understand what could possibly happen here. Did he so grossly misunderstood the character? I cannot beleive it. I am blaming the director (and maybe editors?) for misguiding him into making such a travesty out of Mr. Rochester."
1,hard to see,Pros:Easy installation. We have beams in the house so instead of screwing to the drywall ceiling we just hung the toy with strings to the beam. Worked very well.Cons:Very small.Very dimly lit sun. The planets are barely visible.The light bulb needs to be a bit brighter & the planets need to emit some light as well. The effect was not what we were hoping for! Not that great of a product!
1,"Not all touchscreens are created equal, apparently",Length:: 3:03 MinsI love my Nook Color. This stylus doesn't work on it.
1,Monster at the End of the Book,"The book as pictured is the one I wanted. It was my son's favorite book in 1978-1930. But, when it arrived (at a premium price) it was only the small Golden Book size. Unfortunately this is a book that needs the large rectangular format. The words and graphics are large. So despite the one I received being an original for that time frame, it was NOT as pictured and it was not the large format. It was too much trouble to send it back, so I stuck it on a back shelf. (I later found a reprint in the original large size with a DVD and for only $10.)"
1,Read this before buying the product!,"I bought two for my computers - one with Windows ME and the other with Windows 2000 installed. The one with the Windows 2000 worked fine, except it won't scroll forwards and backbards when using Netscape. The one installed on the Windows ME was a nightmare! First, it did not have the proper driver in the box (a 3.1 driver was included and is not compatible with Windows ME. Second, even after loading the 3.2 driver from the web it did not work properly. At one point, I was without mouse use and spent over 10 hours on the phone with microsoft and still it is not working. Currently, Microsoft has escalated the case so a senior technician will call me back."
1,mad for books,"This is the worst book ever written by Cheryl Holt. The charaters are weak, shallow, emontionless, idiotic and lifeless. The sexual episodes lack passion and it appears as if this book was written in a hurry, without any thought behind it, the dialogue was flat and stilted. The so call heroe of the book Jordan Prescott, Viscount Romney was indecisive and naive. The heroine, Margaret Gray, weak and gullible for someone who lived with an evil woman like her aunt Lavinia Gray. and a selfish cousin like Penelope."
1,horror story,bought Hoover S3765-040 2 years ago & it is only used 1x a month. rubber band keeps falling off Carpet & Floor Power Nozzle - the main part for vacuming floor/carpets. was going to order replacement part for $70 but was sent replacement band gratis (normally about $5) worked for a couple of months. warranty date passed. repair locations are no where near where live so why pay $25 to ship it when it may not work. replacement power nozzle that was $70 is now $149. the entire vacuum only costs about $170. I MUST HAVE GOTTEN THE LEMON.
1,Overwritten...,"...and not at all to my taste. The prose is excellent, but there is far too much of it, with far too little to say. Also, I have a strong feeling that Ms. Tartt has been reading Angela Thirkell. The descriptions of Edie might have been lifted right out of Thirkell."
1,"cheap, sloppy and weak","Overall, I'm disappointed in this tool, especially given the comparable tools from Leatherman.At first glance, it looks like a clever improvement over other multi-tools I have: the blade and drivers fold out directly without having to open the whole thing up. Holding it in your hand, it feels heavy and from that you'd assume it's solidly built.However, the tool is a cheaply-made toy. The ""fit and finish"" is sloppy. The paint that looks sharp in the package chips and scratches very quickly. The pliers have a hard time bending a paper clip. One of the screwdriver blades on mine is so stiff that I can't open it with my bare hands (I have reasonably strong hands). The screws that pin it together are crooked.Clearly someone was trying to take cost out of the tool, and they removed the quality, too.I won't have this thing around long enough for it to blow out as it has for other reviewers. It's such a hunk of junk that I'm giving up on it."
1,...not even the audience!,"A tight thriller, and well worth checking out. However...the central premise is decidedly flawed as are some of theconvoluted explanations to the mysteries that surround ourhero. These explanations are wholly unsatisfactory, as muchas the denouement; in sum, they are quite unbelievable.This reviewer is not familiar with the novel, but it beggarsbelief that the author would echo Chandler and be unsure asto who killed who and why.And on that note: why was the hero's wife's best friend killed?How did the rich-man-in-the-big-house know when to have the hero'scomputer hacked? How come the bent cop who was supposedly sogood at being bent not cover up the murder of the rich-man-in-the-big-house's son? How could the wife pretend to be dead for solong and live with herself for the grief it caused?Actually, I really can't be bothered working it out, find outfor yourself..but don't tell anyone, you never know who's watching!"
1,Replaced twice in two years,"I loved this coffee maker when I first got it. I mean, the brewed coffee never burned and it stayed hot for hours even after I turned off the machine. However, the electronics have gone out on three of these in the past two years. The company did sent replacements but come on...three machines in two years. My third one just went out yesterday and I'm not getting another one. I've had it. I'm switching brands."
1,Philosophers are dumb,I never read this book. But this guy teaches me a Philosophy class that is pretty unuseful. So don't buy it. Who really cares if the mind and soul is the same or not. A message to all philosophers: LISTEN TO PUNK ROCK (and stop wonderind who you are).
1,Meh..,"This book was pretty disappointing. It's got a lot of info, but it's all about growing in the ground, like 1900s farmers.. I'm trying to do square foot gardening and there is virtually nothing in here that can help me with that. I was expecting general veggie gardening tips, but it was lame"
1,Not vinyasa flow,"I guess I am the only person who did not enjoy this dvd.It felt more like a modern dance class than yoga.Shiva did not do any prep to open up the hips and thighs before moving into some fairly advanced poses. She also didn't hold any pose long enough to really be able to breath into them and her instruction was basically non existent.There was no ""flow"", the transitions from one pose to another were cumbersome and unnatural. At least in the practice I did, which is the 51 minute water-heart-air-forwards bends, there were no true vinyasas - I would not have called it ""vinyasa flow"".I am a Yoga Instructor myself and, after hearing so much about Shiva Rea, I was really looking forward to getting this DVD. I truly wish I could have given it a more positive review. I let a couple of my students try it also and they too did not enjoy it.Perhaps it is because I am used to a more Ashtanga based practice, but this really didn't feel anything like yoga to me."
1,GARBAGE!!,"Throw this in the dumpster, along with Jessica's career. This album is so painfully awful, I can't even begin to describe!"
1,"flat, unsupportive and cumbersome","I slept on this pillow for a total of one night and was up most of the night with terrible hip pain even though I was sleeping with the pillow between my legs for support. While it was totally unsupportive for what I needed it for (compresses pretty flat when you lay on it), it was also large and cumbersome and took up a fair amount of space. I decided to return it but have yet to see a refund from the company which shouldn't surprise me since it took them over three weeks to send me the pillow in the first place."
1,"NOT THE ORIGINAL ""FAME"" !! THIS IS A REMAKE !!","I bought this for my wife's birthday. We discovered later, to her great disappointment, that this is a remake of the original ""Fame"" and not as good, not what she expected, not what I thought I had bought. So, note for you -THIS IS NOT THE ORIGINAL ""FAME"" !!"
1,NASTY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Ok.I have had wasabi peas in the past.. These were BEYOND nasty. I will never purchase this product EVER again..I do not recomend this product to anyone.
1,Deceptive Description,"This rice cooker advertises it is a 3 cup cooker, which is what I wanted, but no where in the descriptipn does it mention that it cooks ony 2 cups of WHITE rice, which is what I always use. It's hardly worth the effort & $$$ to cook 2 cups of rice, in a 3 cup cooker I might add. I found this out when reading the instructions that came with the product, but not from the Amazon description. I think this is deceptive & should be added to the online description."
1,To quote the author...,"""Forming the shape of a bonsai can be a very individual subject and therefore it is very difficult for me to convey my ideas to you.""While the author is undoubtedly a talented bonsai gardener, and may well be a good teacher 'at the elbow', his informal jargon may leave the reader puzzled, and his concept of 'dimensional drawings' for tree planning is still unclear, despite numerous example drawings."
1,"Decent point, unbalanced presentation","The film's thesis seems to be that the scientific community should not kill debate surrounding intelligent design. Fair enough. The trouble was that I could not walk away believing that the scientific community is killing debate because the filmmakers did not make their case with any attempt at balance or sobriety. Had this been done, the film may have been a great deal more effective. As it stands, it's simply another voice yelling loudly among others. This did not add to debate or conversation, but surely made the idea of debating the merits of intelligent design a great deal less palatable to the powers that be. I'm sure the filmmakers lined their pockets nicely, though."
1,All over the place,"This is my first Rudy Rucker book, and I guess he's not for me. Lots of wacky things happen from chapter to chapter, but it would be nice if there was a plot that I cared about. It just felt very haphazard."
1,Buyer beware,"Just a heads up, they have displayed this item as a unit of Pegasus knights when in fact it's only a single knight. The first pic is for a unit, but the second pic is for a single one.... A little misleading. I fell for it but just know what your ordering."
1,Heard that one before,A friend recommended that I should get their CD because they rock! So I did. Boy were they wrong!!! These guys suck big time. Just another cookie cutter pop/rock (boring) band of today. I will never buy a CD of these guys ever again and I will never listen to my ex-friend!!
1,Way to fast of a swing for us ( Scott B. Naperville IL ),My wife and I bought this swing cause it was just so nice.... liked that it swings both side to side and back and forth... when we but our son in the thing on the first speed ( slow ) it was going back and forth real nice.... then about 30 sec later it just got going faster and faster.... I don't know about you but im not going to but my new born child in a swing that swings like that..... so I took him out and and tried the fast speed.... it was the same speed.... so we have been putting him in it with out turning it on and just use the other thing that turn.... ( thats really cool ) but reading some of the other reviews maybe I got a bad one there are only a couple of other people that said theres are too fast also.... and ever one else loves there's...... but I didn't pay 119.00 bucks to have him just sit in it with out swinging.... I hope there are other people out there that think the way I do..... thanks for reading this....
1,Think twice,"This system looks great; moreover, it sounds great, unfortunately the quality is far from great. I had this out of the box and hooked up within minutes, I placed five CDs in the carousel and hit the shuffle button. After about two minutes, the player got hung up and it failed to recognize two of the discs. I returned this machine the next day. Also, when you change CDs or open the carousel, it sounds like an explosion; it's loud I tell ya.I seriously wanted to like this player. Most of the shelf systems today are so ascetically hideous. This one, on the contrary, is designed for the eye; unfortunately it is not designed for the ears. Again think twice before purchasing this product."
1,Ripoff of the Book of Mormon,"Orson Scott Card is Mormon, and if we didn't know it before, now we do--he based the entire plot of the Homecoming series on the Book of Mormon. It's so pathetic that I am speechless."
1,"Good for basic ideas, bad for anything else.","I was disappointed with this book. I am a big fan of RK and his ideas, but this book seemed to be a way for RK to cash in on his populartiy and make some fast $$ for himself and his friend. There is no detailed plan for following through on the ideas the author proposes, so it's basically a primer for entry-level investors to give them ideas, but no nuts-and-bolts discussion on how to accomplish anything. I wouldn't recomment this book to anyone unless they were thinking of getting into real estate investing and had no idea where to begin."
1,"skip this, go mechanical","I purchased this product for this last season of baseball. This product gave me and my other coaches nothing but trouble. The buttons would stick and not record or double record a pitch. The device was not consistent about clearing the count. The only button that was consistent was the A/B button. On top of all of this, the battery low indicator came on. I went to replace the battery and found I had to remove several screws just to get the back off. Then I had to remove another screw to release the battery. Very inconvenient. After the new battery the counter last about a week before it quit altogether.Save yourself the bother and get a mechanical pitch counter."
1,---- Clarice this ain't ! ----,"While the author creates an attention holder as was enjoyed in ""Silence"", the story doesn't provide a consistent characterization of Clarice that's believable. As portrayed in this book, Clarice is someone who didn't seem to relate to the character in the previous work. She's someone we don't know. It almost appears that Harris was under some pressure to complete this book, and took what can only be regarded as a cop-out conclusion that leaves the reader wanting more; more of the characterization true to the person of Clarice shown in ""Silence"", not of the limp clone that he portrays here."
1,not the best,"I ordered this based on other reader reviews and disagree with what the others said. I thought it was redundant and boring. The erotica is presented as excerpts from a man's journal, and while there is sex, it's not what I would consider erotic. I'd recommend women look elsewhere for good erotica."
1,No Audio Commentary on all episodes for Stargate SG 1 S8,"I bought the Complete Series of Stargate SG1,and to my surprise Season 8's disks didn't have any audio commentary as mention in the Complete Series so I decided to buy Stargate SG 1-S8 Box Set; and to my amaze no audio commentary in episodes niether. I am returning the box set! By the way, Threads in box set and complete Series is a 105 mins."
1,Not worth the time,"It is so difficult to find a well written romance novel. I spend so much time waiting for my favorite authors to come out with their newest offerings-- I am always looking for someone to augment my collection. I took the Amazon ""customers that bought this book also bought"" recommendation and tried this book. It was confusing and not well plotted. I believe I will just keep waiting for Joan Wolf, Carla Kelly and Mary Balogh to write again."
1,Charges Only,"The first time I used this it worked perfectly. Plugged it in and put the phone in the cradle and it started charging and synchroized perfectly. Since then however it has only worked as a charger. To get it to synchronize is very hit or miss - if you dock the phone and hold it it at the right angle steadily for a few minutes, if the wind is blowing the right way, and the stars are aligned correctly etc. etc. it may sync ok. I've found slipping a couple of business cards behind the phone in the cradle sometimes allows it to stay connected properly so it can sync.But it does work fine as a desktop charger and the charging of the spare battery is a good feature for those of us on the go all day who need the back-up battery handy so it gets a star for that."
1,This movie has no style!,"Well, the book was definitely a lot better.... I did not like how there was so much swearing in the whole thing!! There are so many other elementary and middle school teachers showing this movie to kids... I do not think it is an appropriate movie for kids like me. We should not have to listen to swearing like that in school!!!"
1,Me too; this is not the movie.,"This is not the movie; I was expecting the movie. This item is labeled ""Disk Two"". It is several documentaries about John Huston and his movies. Interesting, but not what I ordered. Where is ""Disk One,"" which I suppose is the movie?"
1,Should be titled 'I'm so great',"I was hoping to use this book to plan a trip to Africa to climb Kili but really there's not enough substance here. The author's constant reminder of all the feats he's accomplished and other people he's bettered (Whitney climb, Grand Canyon hike etc) is just plain annoying. Its an easy read and if that's what you're looking for, great. If you want some details for a trip keep looking."
1,terrible terrible terrible!,"The shock collar worked for about a week on our small dog. The collar would only stay on for a short time and then you would have to press the on/off button again...which is on the collar itself! So...you have to CATCH the dog to turn it on. This doesn't help at all if the reason you bought it is because the dog doesn't listen when it is time to come inside or wont let you catch him! Then it stopped working all together so we bought new batteries but still doesn't work at all. The light will come on, but does nothing when you press the buttons. Very sorry we bought this one when there were so many out there!"
1,Wish I'd spent more,"This one is honestly worth what I paid. I wish I'd paid more. Sharp edges, hard pointy corners, I'm nervous to let my child use it. If you're looking for very inexpensive, and don't worry about such things, it IS worth it, but if you want to be a bit safer, spend a bit more."
1,Hate the Headrest!,"Everytime my 7 month old fell asleep, his head would flop forward and get stuck unger the headrest and he would scream. I exchanged it for the Britax Decathlon. I love Britax and realize this carseat may work great for some, but not for me. Maybe for a larger child with good head control would do better."
1,I really want to like this,"I purchased TUT from Sally's yesterday and gave myself a mani-pedi in the evening, the color is fantastic, like other neons it dries matte, which is easily fixed by applying a top coat (something I'd usually do anyway, alongside a basecoat, to ensure it lasts longer).However, I woke up this morning, noticed it was already a little chipped, took a shower and afterwards noticed that some of the polish was missing entirely from some nails, and on the rest of the others it was more than half gone, despite the fact that I used both base and top coats and three coats of the polish (it's rather streaky, but if it would have lasted longer, I'd be more than happy to put up with that because the color really is great).I really do want to be able to wear this, but I'll likely just have to find a similar color from a different brand, I wouldn't repurchase."
1,Heater control unit.,"This product was supposed to be the right one for my vehicle, but it is completely wrong. Now I have to send it back at my own expense, even though it was advertised to be for my vehicle."
1,Spectacular China,The pictures are beautiful but the book is put together very sloppily and is falling apart before it even comes out of the box
1,Comments on Scientist's guide to Poster Presentations,"I waste my time and money buying this book, I found it no useful to my research activites. It does not give practical recommendations, it does not offer good examples on poster designing and it is obsolete, it is not completly clear on something basic like the dimensions of a poster."
1,Confused,I purchased this item never before stretching a canvas before. I ordered two and I received them promptly but there were NO INSTRUCTIONS on how to use them!
1,Anything for a buck,"This book is not a how to book, nor is it an autobiography--its an expensive advertisement. Donald probably spent an hour writing this. Reading this book one could see re-writes from his previouis books ""how to make a deal""--Endorsements for his friends like Tony Robbins(who paid him millions to do speeches), and the apprentice.Thoroughly worthless."
1,waste of money,"This book is the first edition and is FULL of errors. I don't think anyone edited this book for accuracy. Stick with First Aid, by Bushan, et al. Its format may not be quite as appealing as Step up but it is extremely reliable. I also recommend Robbins Review of Pathology, it has a ton of clinical vignettes that are VERY much like the ones I saw on the USMLE."
1,Fire Hazard,"I purchased the Cusinart DC 1000 thru Amazon. It caught fire today. There has not been any recalls on either of these products but there are alot of complaints about fire hazards and overheating. Cusinart has been notified. PLEASE be careful if you have either of these products. Had my husband not been in the kitchen when it caught fire, no telling how much damage we would have had."
1,"a disappointment, even for a martial arts book","There is very little text to explain any of the techniques, merely a series of photographs for each, and a page wasted (left blank) for ""seminar/practice notes"" after each technique is presented. Hard to believe an editor actually let this go to press, but maybe these are sold at discount during workshops.Secondly, there are only sixteen techniques in the book. Nineteen bucks for sixteen waza is pretty steep, especially when the waza are not really covered in depth.Anyone interested in hanbo should not waste any time on this book, but instead get Hatsumi's Stick Fighting manual, which covers over 50 techniques and contains text a whole lot more informative, even translated from the original Japanese."
1,Awful Movie!,I cannot believe Justin Timberlake has not given up acting! This movie is dull and you will get bored immediately!
1,Not very great,"I actually borrowed this book and some of the advice for curly haired people is disastrous. Such as washing the scalp and conditioning the hair - not very good at all - it leaves your scalp and hair sooooo itchy and dry. the book had no new information, and overall it didn't necessarily tell YOU how to take care of your hair, it was more how a rooky hair dresser should take care of YOUR hair."
1,Worthless,"Worthless! Sound quality is terrible in city, suburbs and country. I have tried many different settings and stations. I have tried the suggestion of the 'small speakers' option in another review. Nothing mproves the sound up to the level of a bad radio broadcast. I get a message on the Ipod ""This accessory does not support charging"" so there is no recharging as advertised. I have successfully charged cell phone from same outlet. Overall a bad mistake."
1,NOT ONLY HP,"I faced the same problems of Stan Dunagan from paris,TN United States ,but my cd writer is TEAC W540E not HP 8200 . Both are supported by InCD as they mention in their homepage."
1,Dear God... and to think that this movie was to be seen?,"I saw this movie when I went with my roommate to visit a couple of his friends at another college... Thank God it was a rented movie! This was the worst movie I have ever seen, being even worse than Cliffhanger (which was, needless to say, at least *funny* in its own badly made way). This movie has terrible acting, a stupid plot, is boring, and instead of being scary, it's just downright disturbing at certain moments of torture (i.e. when the wacko bad guy-figure cuts the girl's finger off... now that was just gross, but not scary). I cannot tell anyone how many times I was falling asleep in this movie. Total trash. And what's more, who would want to spend the $50 for it that it costs at amazon.com? I'd not even waste a penny on this movie. Do yourself a favor, people, and forget you ever heard of this."
1,Latoya and Jennifer were ROBBED!,There is no way that Diana could ever outsing the 2 that should have been runner up to Fantasia. Jennifer and Latoya were robbed by Diana. Diana screeches and screams and her bubbly personality is irritating and annoying. This cd is the worst thing I've ever heard and I am glad that I only listened to my friends copy and that I did NOT buy this crap.
1,concepts and techniques,"I expected much better quality for the price, when the book arrived the last 25 pages or so were not even glued into the binding. Poor workmanship"
1,Bad product! I am so regret of purchasing it!,"This product is not useful at all! Because of the bad internal connection, I have to knock it very hard for several times to make it work. I am very very disappointed!"
1,Da Vinci Code warning label,"I enjoy well written novels. This one was well written for the first 100+ pages. But faltered with the action and chase scenarios. When the plot was developed I found myself not caring about it and lost the interest I had developed in the early stages of the novel.A word of warning: the book should be previewed before purchase. I would recommend reading pages 119-121, 124-126, and pages 231-233 to see if you are comfortable with the author's theme. For those who are not, it would be a waste to purchase this book."
1,Yucko Stinko! What a waste!,"This is hideous! I've had a lawyer write a detailed will for me, but wanted to make changes and decided to try this, since I knew what to include, etc. Well, it was written for a toddler, and kept yammering meaningless garbage. Moreover, it is totally inflexible (i.e., you can't return later to complete certain segments; it just locks up). By way of example, one of the first questions is whether or not you want to be embalmed, and locks up unless you answer it then and there. Inflexible garbage; see an attorney."
1,No reviews/comments?,YOU KNOW WHY!?!? Because its to damn high. WHo can shell out this kind of money. Amazon might as well remove this.
1,Not what I expected.,I was expecting a full length movie. This one didn't have much of a storyline as I expected. But it was ok.
1,Great FICTIONAL Movie,"As a fictional movie, it was great. But it came short on any facts. Just a spewing of liberal trash. This movie is full of fictional characters, portrayed by actors."
1,Disappointed,"I chose this Anne Lamott novel based on the fact it had the most favorable customer reviews here at Amazon of her novels. I am a big fan of ""Bird by Bird"" and had very high expectations. I was very annoyed by this book and wish I had not ignored the one unfavorable review. The characters all sounded like Lamott herself and many of the witticisms came off as just sounding as if she was trying to be clever. Pointless reading unless you just happen to be from a perfectly functional family that is dealing with cancer! I can deal with the lack of plot but a total lack of conflict, or one single compelling character is just plain boring."
1,Unfortunately Cannot Do ZERO stars,"This is not a book. It is nothing more than the postings from an AOL message board that is actually from way back in 1994. What a joke. I don't know who wrote up the ""publisher's review"", but talk about a mislead. Each page is like a separate posting from this ongoing thread and is for the most part very boring. The so called author is simply one of the posters who got involved in the postings at some point. That's it. The so called author tries to constantly instigate controversy, especially with one other poster. Probably for the purpose of creating the controvery of being able to get this book published. Though how he found someone to publish it is beyond me."
1,I don't understand the purpose of this text,"Frankly, I do not understand the purspose of this text. It's obvious that the book covers everything in DBMS, from the very basic like SQL to the very complicated and detailed like internal schema of DBMS.Everything is covered, but not comprehensively. I think the author tries to show you just a little bit of everything.If you have extra bucks and lot of spare time, go for it at your own risk.In fact, I bought this book just because it is a required text for the semester. After buying it, I was extremely disappointed. I learned most of DBMS stuff (oracle, SQL, web programming) by searching online and on other books from shool library. But it is definitely not from this one."
1,"Too much title, not enough substance","The book fails to live up to it's title. It never really discusses ""ungodly"" things, beyond the author's one-time lapse into the use of a few swear words. And the solution offered is, of course, ""repentance, pray for forgiveness and sin no more"". In our complex times I'm afraid this won't make a dent in most of our horrors. The author missed a fine opportunity to assuage some of the many ills that beset today's society."
1,Not good Quality,This item did not live up to its description that I read when I purchased it. It is 5 -7 degrees off of correct tempature.
1,Kindle book is NOT the same book as the print version,The Literary Touchstone Classics are wonderful editions of great classic literature which are very accessible to the student. This Kindle version of The Canterbury Tales is not the same as the Touchstone Classic edition. The Kindle book that is delivered is written in Middle English rather than a translation. It does not have an interactive table of contents. It contains poetry from Spenser and is probably intended for a more scholarly audience.
1,A shallow show for shallow people....,"The premise of this show is to portray shallow characters, leading empty, meaningless lives in an urban setting. There is little if any discussion of the important things in life- spirituality, family, or anything beyond immediate gratification through sex and relationships with other shallow characters. If you truly find this show meaningful, and somehow related to your life, you need to reexamine your priorities and values."
1,Product Does Note Work,"This seemed like a simple enough purchase, and the low price seemed right. I got what I paid for. I purchased the adapter to output video from my computer to my monitor. The device did not work. Also, one of the screw seemed to be very bent and did not spin freely. Buy an adapter from somewhere else. For the $1.88 that I paid, it isn't even worth the hassle to return it."
1,Not really a good product.,"The product spoilt within 2 weeks of purchase. The head set still works but the mic does not. If am talking with someone with it, I would hear the person but the person will not hear me."
1,Pretty but of limited use,"This book has some nice pictures, but much of the written information is simply wrong. For example, the discussion of how to determine an age of a bottle is seriously flawed. The author talks about how to dig up privies, but the info. on how to locate them is feeble and largely fanciful. Good luck buying a Sanborn map! Many of the prices given, too, are out of whack with reality---either way to high or way too low. Far too much space---about half the book!---is devoted to Jim Beam bottles and Avon bottles, which are of little or no interest to traditional bottle collectors. Put that stuff in a separate book! Meanwhile, the bottle YOU want to look up is almost invariably missing. Hopeless. But yes, some pretty pictures."
1,NOT KBCO,This listing is really misleading as the disc has nothing to do with KBCO. This is not a KBCO Studio C release in any means. The songs were recorded at The Boulder Theatre. Don't be fooled like I was.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!!!,I received this MP3 player for x-mas and from the start it had problems. First it would shut down uneeplainable and more recently the battery life has decreased to a pathetic level. I am at Amazon right now to buy an Intel MP3 player.... Do yourself a favor and dont buy the Rio
1,toaster oven,"I found this machine not to be the best. The turn knobs are very finicky, and they can break very easliy. You cannot stop the timer even when the toast is finished. You have to let it run it's course. Very annoying."
1,Not so good,"I was disappointed in this product. The company was great, I got it quickly. I just thought it was a more durable cooling pad. When I sat my computer on it, the pressure caused the fans to stop. I was able to rig it so that it works but I shouldn't have to do that. I quess for what I paid for it, I shouldn't expect more. Oh well lesson learned. I have nothing against the company that sold it. I got the product immediately."
1,Awful!,"This is the worst DVD I have ever bought. In fact, its IDENTICAL to another Avril Lavigne documentary called Skater Girl. They just slapped a new cover on it and changed the title. Its dated 2007 but there is nothing on it about her second or third albums, it tentatively ends in 2003. If its a recent vid how come its missing 4 years? And why have a recent picture of her as the cover photo?There is NO original Avril music or videos or concert footage. The background music is of artists I've never even heard of and they're really not very good. The interviews are with people that arent within Avrils inner circle and although it has some decent photos from before she made it big, it uses stock footage of interviews from the Let Go promo tour. They imply that she made a second album but dont even mention the name or a single song from it.DO NOT BUY THIS DVD!!!!!"
1,"Barely a ""Health"" magazine anymore","I used to enjoy this magazine, but it has gone downhill. Rather than ""Health"" the magazine's focus has become getting women to bed, sex, and fashion. The title of the magazine should be changed to ""Men's Fashion"" or ""Playboy"". If you want a fashion magazine, there is already GQ. The magazine cover usually tries to portray ""muscle"" type articles, and there are articles on working out, but the focus on ""Health"" is very limited."
1,"Lame, Stupid And Certainly Not Funny","I'll admit there was a time when cledus was actually funny, but his latest attempt at parody not only comes off as lame, but it is also very much not funny. can't people get over it, i mean for him to still think the dixie chicks incident is still worth slandering and discussing, almost 8 months after it occurred, is truly sad. Well, cledus must have though it was still funny to release four songs about it, neither striking a single chord of humour, but rather comming off as childish and juvenile. I would recommend you burn your money in a toaster before you spend it on this piece of mainstream trash. A release such as this only affirms the newly held notion that free speech is a right, that when exercised, becomes liable to slander and vilification. the dixie chicks are only one of a few remaining musical acts who really understand the meaning of music, and are able to produce music with amazing dignity and quality."
1,HAVENT EVEN RECIEVED THIS ITEM YET!!!!!!!!!!,I ordered this item on 24th nov its now 27th dec and i STILL havent received this item!!! I paid shipping so it would get here on time as it was a christmas present and its not arrived yet!!!!! They then told me it would be here for 24th dec and guess what?????? its STILL not here! The service i have received is terrible and its made me never want to order from these people again!
1,A little bit bland,My first Stuart Woods novel. It was a little bland with characters that could have been more developed and a slow start. I finished the book but didn't feel like this was something that was extremely mesmerizing nor captivating. If you have nothing else to read I suppose this is the book for you.
1,Unfulfilling,"Reading this book was like going to dinner at friend's house and smelling something wonderful in the kitchen. Yet when the meal was served it was something totally different and unappetizing. It starts out with an interesting idea but then spends the rest of the book hinting around it while venturing off in some pseudo-spy story with unwarranted and disturbing sexual overtones. One is left with a lot of unanswered questions about the activities behind what the author wrote. Her notions on international relations was simplistic, at best. Very disappointing."
1,Like an Incomplete Brochure,"This book is good as an introduction to the HK small arms but not as a definitive guide. There are key pieces of false information, poorly researched history and extended areas of rewritten H&K; catalogs.If you are fairly educated on Heckler and Koch small arms I do not recommend this book; there is nothing special in this publication."
1,im 14 but not a user ...this is a disgrace,I have listened to The Prince of darkness King of Rock maker of Metal since I was 3 and im not done yet...DONT BUY THIS ALBUM GO BUY THE BLIZZARD OF OZZ OR DIARY OF A MADMAN!
1,Pass on this for a different kind,"I ordered three types of popcorn to sample when I bought my Whirley Pop (which by the way is friggin awesome, get one, they are cheap and work so well!), all from Wabash. I got the baby white, the baby yellow, and the ladyfinger. Using 1/2 cup of corn and 2 tablespoons of oil in the whirley, both the ladyfinger and the baby yellow would pop up fluffy enough to fill the entire whirley. The white consistently only fills about halfway...it just doesn't taste as light and crisp either. Recommend going for the ladyfinger (tastes the best and the least hulls by far, but it's so tiny it's almost hard to eat without dropping a lot) or yellow if you're trying this brand. Hope this helps."
1,boring,"I tried, but I just could not get into this book. Since I gor my kindle I guess I've become a little more critical about the books I read and if I get halfway through it and can't get interested I just delete it and move on. This was one of those books."
1,A mystery,"Installed software on two computers and set up all cables. Prints from one computer-- not other. No indication either in manual or on device how to switch. Software screen shots in booklet bear no relationship with installed software. And, of course, sit on hold for tech support. Gave up. Sent back."
1,Terrible item!,"I just received the dog tennis balls today, with in 1 hour the balls went to nothing! Very bad item! It was a waste of good money! A very upset buyer!! I would give this item a 0 if I could."
1,ehh....wishy washy,"It's ok, in my opinion Sleater Kinney has strayed so far from riot grrl, they don't even riot anymore. They're just a talented female rock band. For us Sleater Kinney collecters it's deffinetly something to own, but if you're new to them... start with Call the docter, or self titled. The best part about this album is Stephen Trasks envolvment in it! If you are interested in him check out Hedwig and the Angry Inch."
1,Sad,"I was so disappointed in this tea. Bought it with the assumption that an Irish blend would be bold and with lots of flavor. Completely opposite. I normally don't buy products that do not have reviews, but I took a chance on this one. I see another reviewer felt the same way. Sorry, Choice, wanted to love you, but this was a big fail."
1,A WARNING BEFORE YOU BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK,I had both the defective disk problem AND the graphics card problem that many other reviews mention. AMAZON should be much more clear about the system requirements as this game will not work on many home PCs including my Dell PC that is less than a year old.Thanks for spoiling Christmas for my son. He assumed Santa normally delivered working product until this year!
1,Not worth the money,"The sound is clear, but carries no base. I have a pair of Sony MDR-CD180 I paid $20.00 for that I was going to replace; I needed more volume and not loose sound quality for my MP3 player. These headphones are not it! Even at low volume all you get are the highs, there is no depth to the sound at all. I guess it all depends on what you want them for. If you listen to Heavy Metal, save you money, on this series anyway. The more expensive series may be better but I'm not going spend more money on something that may or may not give me sound quality I want. They look good sitting on the shelf though!"
1,Ughhhhh...,"The first Ringworld novel was great, but it just went down from there. Why did Niven have to go and spoil that great seemingly empty ringworld of the first novel by populating it with all sorts of pitiful creatures. I mean, vampires? Give me a break."
1,I didnt even finish it,"This was the ABSOLUTE worst King book I have ever tried to read. I always finsh his books, even when he gets a little to long winded. I was so anxious to buy this book that I bought it the day it was available. I got half way through thinking OH MY GOSH this has got to turn the corner for the better. A few more pages and I gave up. This was the only King book i never have finished. When King's next book comes out, I will wait a few weeks and check out the reviews on amazon."
1,Disappointing,"Ronny Jordan his first 2 albums, ""The Antidote"" and ""The Quiet Revolution"" launched his career. He was called the new George Benson. Every track of these 2 albums was really great. I bought all his albums since then, but his later albums were never as good as those first 2. I admire that he tries all different kind of styles. On this album he tries evening background music. The tracks often start strong, but than it does not build, it becomes a lullaby. Boring, and I almost never play it."
1,"This book is a coverup of the ""hunger"" industry scandal .","Sweet Charity is a thinly veiled cover-up for the many middle and upper class people benefitting from the ""hunger"" scandal wherein billions of dollars that could and should be spent on poor people are instead wasted on staff, buildings, refrigerators and trucks -- the whole food bank and soup kitchen nine yards. When added to for-profit agribusiness interests whose garbage is dumped into this system for tax deductions and at taxpayers' expense, the ""food"" element of the larger poverty industry makes sense. This book won't tell you that the food banks and soup kitchens often receive legal ""kickbacks"" via tax-deducted charitable ""grants"" from the likes of Procter and Gambol and other giant corporations. If you want the real scoop on another of agribusiness' dirty secrets, read something else. If you don't mind getting hoodwinked, go shopping."
1,"Too much whining, not enough gore","If you enjoy seeing snot running down the nose of an obnoxious college student as she whimpers in fear, buy this video. If you want to see hyped-up, trumped-up nonsense, with no basis in fact, but this video. If you want two goosebumps on a scale of five, buy this video. The companion piece is a total sham and a waste of time, money and viewer's neuronal connections...it's all bull, with not enough gore."
1,Eh!,"If you like the politically correct style WIP films of the '90s, then you will like this one too. It was too PC for me. Only saving grace was that it has some sapphic t&a. The film is very weak, otherwise. It fails as a drama. It's schmaltzy. Has little to no action, or violence. And scores almost a zero for subversiveness."
1,very bad service!!....,i really did not like the service i ahve paid for this product but have not goten it.i told amazon that i havent got it and they dident do anything i recomend not to get i hate it....
1,Dangerous,Addded air and got 3 short blasts. Added more air and can exploded. There is no way to tell how much air is in canister.
1,Last Night,The movie won't show here. It is the wrong zone! I've bought a film from you before (under my mother's name) and that worked perfectly. Why do you ship a film to South Africa that won't show here? This has cost me quite a bit of money and now it's useless. I'm very displeased.
1,Terrible,"Usually when I don't like something I say its just a matter of taste. But when I served the pie to some friends, we all took one bite and spite it out. There was definitely something wrong with this pie. I can't describe the taste other than it tasted like it had gone bad. I definitely won't be ordering from Scott's cakes again."
1,ugh!,okay... I wasted my money. This book is disgusting and I could not even finish it! Nothing like 50 Shades! I would not recommend this book to anyone.
1,"A good item for middle-aged, stoned people or second year art students","This thing is way too long and renders an interesting artist boring.Far too self-involved and masterbatory. I actually liked A.G.'s work before I saw this movie. Now? Not so much. I just can't deal with people who take themselves that seriously, especially a guy who spends all day arranging twigs.The attempt at creating drama out of a dude stacking rocks is rediculous at best.Just stick to the picture books if you want to continue enjoying this artist."
1,Old stock from 2006!,"I received mine with a label stating it was made in 2006. The packaging was faded like it was sitting in the sunlight for years. Upon opening the filter box, the filter element had no light coating of oil on it. Apparently 6 years sitting on the shelf deteriorated the oil. When I shined some light through the filter element, I can see small holes, which means the filter itself is deteriorating. The seller was from Amazon.com and usually they never get it wrong but this time they did. I sent this one back and ordered a replacement. Will post details when I get that one.3/28/12 Update: After a series of return/exchanges, the third filter was of great quality. Made in 2/2012, no oil or filter material problems!"
1,Sucker Punched,"Boy do I feel like chump. I bought this DVD based on the reviews here and because of it's overall 4 star rating. Holy Crap was I ever sucker punched in the back of the head by this wretched little pile-o-lizard spittleI love cult films and I also love films that are so bad they are good etc. and I guess that's the main reason why I fell for these reviews hook, line & sTinker!I could not even find it in my heart to finish this movie after about an hour I couldn't take it no more, so back in the case and into the garbage disposal crunch crunch Bye Bye. Aaaarrrggghh one can only wait so long for something/anything of interest to happen or be said.Please don't end up a chump like me and stay away from this one, because I can assure you the people who wrote these great reviews are not going to get together, take a collection and give you you're money back. Bitter? You bet."
1,Nice pictures but nearly content free,"This book presents a highly simplistic view of what it takes to mix a quality recording. A few good points are made but most of the book is filled with redundant diagrams and space wasting text boxes. I bought this book on the web. Had I seen it in a bookstore and scanned it, I would have placed it back on the shelf."
1,Such a disappointment,"I've seen A Chorus Line twice on stage. I bought a copy of this DVD at a budget price, watched it once and even going into it with low expectations, I was disppointed. Anyone who has only seen this movie version and not the stage version will probably wonder how this play could have won the Pulitzer prize and the Tony award. As others have mentioned, the rather weak sub-plot of Cassie and her past love affair with the director gets pushed to the forefront in the movie, while many of the great songs from the stage production are either cut entirely or presented in truncated fragments. I think this movie is one of the worst stage to screen adaptations ever put to film. Just listening to the original cast album will give you a better idea of what this play is all about."
1,what the hell is this??????????,"there is no structure or actual talent present at all in this cd! all it is is just more scream scream scream nu metal. if you like real music check out the strokes, puddle of mudd, and smile empty soul. those bands have talent! this is utter crap!"
1,This Seller...,"Everything was fine with this purchase...until I wanted to return it. It was a gift and the recipient didn't want it. So, I notified Amazon and they notified the seller...twice. NO response.Amazon gave me a refund. I STILL haven't heard ANYTHING from the seller. Buyer beware!"
1,I figured it out,"About every nine minutes you'll ask yourself, ""Why am I wasting my time watching this bomb?"""
1,Don't buy this style earpiece,I used Jabra products for years. Their quality has slipped to low levels. No one could ever hear me when using this device-- the mic is too far away from your mouth. Go with a boom style earpiece.
1,Get the sony,"It works, but why spend about the same for a remote with so few functions when you can get the better sony for approximately the same cost? I bought this one in a pinch at Best Buy, they were out of the sony's and I needed the remote that day. Given the choice (though I haven't used it) the Sony looks very appealing."
1,Not popular music,"Was persuaded by the positive reviews (which sounded very educated mind you) to try something different. OK, so I found out I really value rhythm, continuity, and meaning in music. Which means I can appreciate the likes of Pink Floyd but not this inharmonious bunch called Mogwai. This is actually more like Heavy Metal, not ""Pop"", so I wouldn't have wasted my money if it has been properly labelled as such."
1,inconsistent results,"I ordered this scale on the strength of the generally positive previous reviews. The unit I received yeilded markedly inconsistent results. Successive tries with the same person varied as much as three pounds. I returned it. A disappointing experience, especially because the scale is quite attractive."
1,step down,I have read most Harlans' books and find this one a step down. I am really going to struggle to get through it.
1,Not what I expected.,I was looking for a book that was positive about women being single because I enjoy being single and it's so hard to find books or stories about people who are actually happy with the single lifestyle. This book isn't it. For every positive story there are at least 2 negative stories and it's hard to weed through to find the positive ones. I only got a quarter of the way through before I decided I couldn't finish this book. Some of these women sound so pathetic. They don't like being single and they don't like being married so they join together to commiserate their unhappiness. Just too pathetic.
1,Save you money.,"The Author starts out pushing hype with unrealistic numbers. When I read this crap it makes me cringe. Two great books are ""How I made 5 million in real estate"" by Nickerson and ""Investing in Real Estate"" by Andrew McLean. I have been buying foreclosures in MI. I really dont see it getting you a jet or 20 million like this snake oil guy hypes but you can build a nice net worth over time andperhaps replace your earned income.I felt that Kiyosakis Cash Flow Qaudrant and Rich Dad Poor Dad were outstaniding pieces of work. When I read crap like Real EstateRiches I wonder if Kiyasaki has gone down the wrong path for a quick buck."
1,Not what I expected,"The Van Halen early years are some of the most important as far as rock evolution goes and the change in the face of heavy metal and guitar playing as we knew it. Eddie Van Halen re-invented the guitar (quote by Frank Zappa). Therefore most of this DVD is useless as it doesn't cover the main drive behind the band, the guitar. I also found it disappointing that each time the DVD looked as if it was going to show some guitar ripping it just cut off. Therefore this can only be described as a gimmick and a rip off to the fans. The backing music is also an insult to the band cause it ain't as good as the music of the band. 'Ain't Talking about Love', 'Atomic Punk', 'Somebody get me a Doctor', 'Your no Good', and on and on and on. Therefore the makers of this DVD only did it to make money for themselves and have ripped off the band. Unfortunatly the only way at least at the moment the fans can get a real taste of the early Van Halen years is to listen/watch bootleg recordings."
1,Inexcuseable,"Inexcuseable. Being a short movie there would have been ample room on the DVD to include the original Japaneese version of the film. The Raymond Burr version presents broken shards of the original film interspersed with an american narrator spliced in to soothe the minds of racist 1950's america. ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" viewers can choose between english subtitling or english dubbing. Godzilla fans get neither. DVD extras are a nice, but what's the point when they don't include the movie in the first place?"
1,Not enough Scriptural Reference,"Ok book, but not enough scriptural reference...Marriage will not be successful unless you do it according to the holy scriptures...Marriage was created by God and should be done his way. The book also lacks information pertaining to how couples should treat other according to scripture so that we can love each other with God's love"
1,Dont like it,It heats up the bottle okay but it has been known to shock you. Doesnt have an on/off switch. The water in it turned Brown and stained my bottled. Even keeping it clean!
1,Don't Waste Your Money,I ordered this glider before my son was born because it was inexpensive and had good reviews. It is nice looking chair but not very comfortable. The material seems cheap and the bottom cushion lost its shape very quickly. It is also uncomfortable to sit in for a long period of time and I had a hard time sleeping in it. My biggest complaint is that the spring in the chair broke three times. I am petite and not much weight was put on it. We ended up returning it and getting our money back.
1,Not relevant with all the hypes -- too general,"Being a person working in SF bay area, I quickly learned that this book was among the inferiors of the book on the Valley.The descriptions are too general -- the interviews were too shallow and no specific issues are presented in a clear-lighted manner.Good selections for books on the Valley I think is ""Accidental Empires"" by Cringely."
1,Not for e-mailing or Internet,"Beware of the word ""Most"". It is advertised as working with most Windows programs. But it will not type text into Internet Explorer or Outlook Express! Two of the most widely used Windows programs. As a quadriplegic, I have been using almost all versions of Dragon NaturallySpeaking and they have worked fine. When I finally was able to contact technical department, I was told that there was no workaround or fix for this bug. The only thing that you can do is use cut and paste, as I am doing here."
1,Beyond Terrible,"Where do I start? I should have listened to other reviews, but I figured, ""nah, that's just people who don't know how to use the product complaining"". Bad move. This product should be pulled from being sold at amazon and everyone who bought it issued a full refund. The thermal pad is INCREDIBLY thin and does not separate from the paper it comes with, thereby making it useless. After trying three pads, I threw the rest away."
1,DIDN'T DO MUCH,This is a very cheaply made product that only brought in a few channels and most of those were shopping channels. Oddly enough though it only brought in 3 network affiliate channels that kept blinking in and out it brought in an independent channel from an adjoining state perfectly clear. Perhaps it depends on where you live but I am up on a hill in the Boston suburbs and expected better reception with this.
1,Needs a widescrren release,WB needs to rerelease this in widescreen. It ain't right to release widescreen filmed movies on dvd in Full screen only
1,bad music no likee,"I know why the guy on the cover of this CD is crying: he was forced to listen to it.I gotta tell ya, I'm not a fan of The Nickelback. The first time I heard that song ""How You Remind Me"" I thought it was some kind of joke. Well, if it was a joke, it's now five years later and I still don't get it. Can you please explain to me why anyone would want to hear some guy with really bad hair blather on about some nonsense, then say ""Yeah!"" like 50 million times?To borrow a line from Billy Madison, ""I award you no points, and may God have mercy on your soul."""
1,Most boring play of The Six Wives of Henry VIII..,Really poor acting and very boring. I doubt that I will even watch the other two DVD's in the box. Wish I would have saved my money for something better..
1,"terrible product, lousely customer service","This screen house is terrible, the poles do not lock together. There is very little overlap from roof to screen sides making bug entry very easy. I had it put up for an hour and it shook apart twice in a lite breeze. I called for return that same day 07-21-06, it is now 09-19-06 and have yet to receive return slip. This after waiting 7 to 10 days and calling again and promised a new slip would be sent in 3 buisness days. Do not use this screen house or vendor!!!"
1,New Fears,"Our two year old never had any problems with playing/sleeping in her room until this book about the monster with the sharp teeth was read to her in a class. Now she gets scared and yells out ""Monster!"" This has been on a daily basis since exposure to the book two weeks ago. Sure the book ends with telling the monster to go away, but this affirms that monsters exist in the first place. Even though other reviewers have had no issues, based on our personal experience we would caution on reading to the very young."
1,Dark Pictures,"As a picture book on in-depth repairs, the darkly printed photographs are difficult to make out. Lots of good information, just can't get as much out of the pictures as hoped."
1,Can't get past the intense anal sex scene,"Rented this for a date night with my wife, have liked most all of Jim Carry movies. All was good until the ""intense"" anal sex scene. We try and be open minded but that was as far as we could go. Maybe this is a good story line...but will never know. Just wasn't expecting this...."
1,Abortions,"Although this movie was very well directed and had great performances by Michael Caine, Tobey Maguire, and Delroy Lindo, I was thoroughly disgusted with the overwhelming pro-abortion theme. I watch movies to be entertained. I don't want to be preached to. This story was way off the mark.I felt very ill after watching it because of the complete disregard for human life. The most obvious scenes were the disposals of the fetuses (and older?) into the fire in the back yard. The way it was filmed made it obvious that there should be no consideration whatsoever for the lives of babies, that they are to be thrown away at the whim of whatever parent just happens to be ""inconvenienced"" by their births.I am a fan of Tobey Maguire and very much enjoyed his performance in ""Ride with the Devil"" a lot more than this garbage."
1,Broken from the start,"I was very disappointed to wait on this scanner for a week and a half for it to not work straight out of the box. As mentioned in a couple of other reviews, the scanning mechanism got stuck. It started scanning and then returned and made a horrible noise. The normal scanning operation seemed to be pretty loud even before it got stuck."
1,Total TRASH -,"First of all. I am from Brazil and this was a ""Brazilian production"". But Every Brazilian CG ARtist just hate this production, cause it's a shame for the world to had something like that produced here. Brazil is very strong in Computer Graphics, exporting so much talented artists to around the world, and we have tons of very good artists here. Please, don't consider that production as an example of Brazillian CGI Capacities, this is the worst thing we ever saw on our industry..."
1,You cannot trust the pronunciation instructions.,"This book is good for learning basic Vietnamese vocabulary for the price and size.However, I found a few grammatical mistakes.And the pronunciation instructions are horrible. For example, I don't understand why all the beginning c is instructed to pronounce as g. In fact the c sounds k. The pronunciation of ""cam on"", thanks in English, is shown [gam urn]. If you say like this, Vietnamese people never understand you. I have tried it already. My husband is a Vietnamese who speaks tieng Viet."
1,Bear,I wasn't expecting it to be sooooooo tiny. I guess i should have read more details. Still it is very cute.
1,Bad show for a Tom Clancy novel,"Unlike Tom Clancy's previous works, The Bear and the Dragon falls way short of the standard that fans have come to expect from him. His potrayal of the average PRC Chinese is accurate -if the book was set in the early 80s. Many racist remarks are sprinkled throughout the book, making a boring product offensive as well. Give it a miss and spend your money somewhere else."
1,FOUND IT MUCH CHEAPER,"Unfortunately, right after ordering the product, I found it more than 100.00 Dollars cheaper at the Dallas Cowboys page. I regreted my purchase deeply."
1,its not its portrayed to be.,All I got out of this was just the feel of an ordinary magnum. Nothing really special. The hype isn't true.
1,"Great concept, horribly drawn out","I do like the characters and the concepts put forth in this book, but if you're looking for a little less talk and a lot more action, DON'T get this book. It was so long-winded, I didn't even get past the first 150 pages! If you're an impatient reader, search elsewhere for something to read."
1,"Burn, ""Burn, Christmas! Burn!!"" Burn!!","While I sympathize with the anti-consumerism ideals behind it, this book is just poorly done. The rhyming scheme is stilted and forced, it's overly wordy, and the narrative is disjointed. It's bad, folks. This book is bad. As Dorothy Parker said, ""This book should not be set aside lightly. It should be thrown with great force."" Do yourself and those Chinese printers a favor: suppress your consumerist tendencies! DON'T BUY THIS BOOK! May it go out of print immediately. Amen."
1,"Disapointment from ""the greatr meaning of water""","I dive for many years now.I love diving and every thing that included in it.For years I'm looking for a moovy that will b a bit like ""The big Blue""When I saw that there is a moovy about free diving I thought it might be a bit like this moovy that I love so I bought it.What a mistake - instad of moovy about the joy in free diving I saw a dipressing moovy about illness that dosen't even look real since it dosen't seem possible for free diver to have sistic fibrosis.I got so dipressed from the moovy.If I knew I would never by it""Have Fun"""
1,"Where you at Rock, where you at ?!?!","I respect Kid and his attempt to sell country songs. Do doubt boy make your money...BUT the WHOLE album?!? I'm a huge Kid Rock fan, and I dont mind a couple of country tracks, but what about your rap/rock fans? I blind/deaf buy Kid Rock CD's, but not anymore. I will enjoy my old Kid CD's, I guess that era is dead..."
1,I expected more,"With no offense to the author, I found the book to be disappointly dry. I was expecting a book of retrospective interviews along the line of ""Warday"". The interviewees weren't written in a way that made them particularly interesting. Certainly, those who had survived such a holocaust would be emotionally injured for life. Still, I wanted to care, because I wanted very, very much to enjoy this book."
1,DO THESE PLANTS EXIST????,"I ordered this plant December 3, 2011 for Christmas for my brother's family. It's too late to get them anything else. Thank you for ruining this Christmas present. This is by far the slowest company I have ever dealt with. It's almost February. Are you planning on sending the plant December, 2012?"
1,=Ernest P. Worrel for grown-ups,"There is an inescapable air of self-indulgence throughout this film, and it stifles any potential the novel but inevitable premise held. Alda's relation to each character screams for pity and fails to make the viewer care unless by some unfortunate taste one finds him and his misadventures somehow attractive. This is a high jinx film with a history buff's gloss, a formula for contrived disaster and TV movie tripe. The rousing climax of the filmed reenactment is corny and chaotic, calling either for an unaffordable budget (from wasting good actors) or a span that could not be controlled. If the angle of book-to-film frustration is to work, the sideplots must be altogether ignored. The humor and general plot is unbearably innocent, requiring a naive audience not easily found. I found it used for $1, and flea-market bartering could probably put anyone else well within that range."
1,Shoulda paid more for something else.,"I'm somewhat happy with this pressure cooker set. It takes a while to seal, and won't seal if it's not on high heat, so it's hard to make food you can burn, like rice. I think this is because it has safety features not found on old pressure cookers, but perhaps more expensive brands/models don't have this flaw. It's also hard to figure out how to use. The pressure valve label is confusing to some - the correct positioning is 180 opposite from what it appears. Only cooks at 8 psi and 12 psi, not 15 psi (250F), so it requires about 20% more cooking time (at 12 psi) than a 15 psi cooker. Didn't realize this when I bought it. For the $[...] I paid, it is OK. I wish I'd bought a better cooker; I'm pleased with the results.[...]"
1,file cart,The size is perfect. The product itself is unstable and wobbly. The base clips fall off. This is not a mobile cabinet that I will use long term due to the instability.
1,"Catherine Coulter's ""Eleventh Hour"": Duty or Deadline?","Speaking as a fan of Catherine Coulter's previous detective novels, I am disappointed in this product. I wish I didn't feel compelled to refer to it as such, but the ""Eleventh Hour"" seems indeed to be a book that was written for commerce, and at the last moment to appease an editor. As with Iris Johanson's recent books, we have another writer with a fine imagination who has left her work poorly crafted. It might have been an acceptable first draft, but in truth, I feel even that is being kind."
1,This was a boring book....,"This book was a great dissapointment. What I wanted was a light, funny read. What I got was a semi-depressing bore. I had never heard of this book, or of the hype others had mentioned. I was bored and needed a book, ran to my nearest warehouse club and bought this. I think back and I bought it because it seemed similar to The Nanny Diaries which I found interesting and very funny.Andrea is NOT a believable character. She is saccharin sweet and a bore. We are lead to believe that she is a saint and doesnt deserve such abuse. Well QUIT!!! That is what I kept thinking through the whole book! QUIT, QUIT, QUIT!! And she should have followed the old addage ""If it is too good to be true, it probably is"" referring to her interview and job.Also, the whole looking at the woman and the fashion world down her nose with disdain,but, managing to ""score"" high priced items was so annoying to me. I just felt the ""saint"" Andrea was a hypocrite and was begging to be a doormat."
1,Most boring video,Better watch something for free on Youtube. This is boring. Narrator is boring and keeps mumbling throughout. His reasoning is questionable. Keeps referring to non existent practices in different places with no proof.
1,Did Elizabeth Berg really write this?,"I am a huge fan of Elizabeth Berg's books and eagerly awaited the arrival of this one. What a disappointment! I found it so bad - and so unlike anything else she has written - that I was seriously questioning whether she HAD actually written it! To me, it seemed like the work of an entirely different author. It didn't hold my attention (I gave up halfway through) and the writing style seemed weak and contrived, when compared to something as assured and polished as 'Open House'."
1,disappointed,"Snakey Skill Building Puppet by Pockets of LearningWe were so excited to find such an innovative skill building toy, gave it to our grand-daughter for her birthday, but immediately found that the zipper was impossible for even an adult to work plus the fabric it's made of was ripping away at various seams! Not durable at all, not worth the money, a big disappointment."
1,Horible,"Two good songs: Until it Sleeps and Bleeding Me. From Metallica, this CD is HOrrible. What the @#$%s wrong with Hero of the Day, it sounds like pop. Pass this one up and buy some of their 80's stuff."
1,"Good tips, but too many errors!","This book is a good crash course with a lot of helpful tips and rules to remember, BUT when it comes to examples or practice test, author makes a lot of mistakes. What's more, author does not explain well why this answers better over others. And most of the time, when she tries to explain, she basically says ""it's right - just because it is right!"" Does it make sense? No? Well, get used to this kind of explanations because this is author's tactic."
1,No love lost!!,"Ok,ok, ok! This story in my opinion is lacking in all aspects of a romance novel. The lost love storyline is what caught my eye because I love those type of stories, but as the story inveils itself, it was not much of a love story. But I am glad I read the story for myself to see just how the book was all about. Many a person had told me that it was not all that good, always be your own judge! I must say they were right, but I'll let you see for yourself!!"
1,Glitch City,"I bought this mp3 player before iPods gained fame. It worked well at first. It was easy to load songs on it. When you would turn it on though, it would have to register each song individually into the player -- it calls it ""indexing"".After a while this player has had so many Error messages and glitches that it doesn't work properly anymore. When I tried to get support online, there was no help from the company that makes the ILO. The people I talked to were rude and just unhelpful.Today, I can't get it to work right. I turn it on...it says it is updating the index, but never finishes until I decide to not waste anymore time with it and remove the battery.It was a waste of $80."
1,Bad CD Mastering Job,Great music but this CD was transferred from a scratchy vinyl. It sounds dull and one can hear clicks and crackle.
1,"Arrived broken, customer service feckless","Imagine my surprise when my wife opened her [$$$ vacumn] (bought here) only to find it broken albeit in a small way. After waiting on hold for 40 minutes, a customer service cheerily told me that they were well aware of the defect--a broken spring in the handle cap--and they would mail a replacement spring that I ""would enjoy installing myself"". 8 weeks later I am still waiting for the spring and looking forward to being put on hold for 40 minutes to get instructions.If they know it is broken, why not recall it and fix it? They are just shifting labor costs on to their customers."
1,wrong size,Apparently this is an ongoing problem for what looks like years. You may get a bigger one like me or if your order the bigger one you may get a smaller one. I need something small as I will be using it as a ball pit otherwise it would have been a mistake in my favor. When I called to get the size I ordered shipped to me I was told they did not have it. On the upside the customer service at their company is pretty awesome and the shipping is super fast.
1,Waste of money,I do not recommend this product if you are looking to lose weight or tone up. You can stand and twist and work the same muscles as you can with this. Very disappointed.
1,frustrating,these openings would be great if the other player played the exact moves that are in the example. I wish he'd shown examples of what to do and why if the other player deviates from the examples.
1,no love.... no tribute paid,"I would expect a tribute album to express, through playing the same songs, a personal style that addresses feelings about the original artist/album. ""Paying tribute"" to the original that spawned this music here...This strikes me as a cover album. And a bad one. A bad copy.The soul and intensity of the original is gone. The unpredictability and pacing of the original is gone. Its just a slow weak anticlimatic arrangement of notes similar to Deloused. Which makes me wonder... Why? These are someone else's songs played in a different style, without any hint of soul and feeling. Robots could play this.Creative? No. No WAY!!! A big waste of time I feel.Classical music fans might enjoy it. I probably would if you didnt tell me it was a volta cover album. Its got an attractive sound in general. But a fan of the unique sound and extreme depth of Deloused, will question the decisions leading to the creation of this 'tribute.' Who is it paying tribute to?"
1,Men at Work - Out of Gas,"I remember purchasing this album when it came out in 1985. I hated it and soon cashed it in on a trade at the local vinyl exchange. Their 1982 album, Business as Usual, is stellar all the way through. Cargo, released the following year, was okay, but far below the first release, and - with the exception of Overkill - had the feel of a gathering of outtakes and extras that were not deemed worthy of inclusion on Business as Usual.I recently found a copy of Two Hearts - again on vinyl - at a local shop and decided to give it a second chance. Time has not improved this mess. This was apparently the band's last gasp. While it is not painful or grating to listen to, there is nothing memorable here. For completists only.As an aside, some of Colin Hay's later solo projects are quite good."
1,Didn't work,Tried to play on two different Blu-ray players and it simply would not play. I could only get it to play on my computer. No good.
1,Awful,"I was determined not to compare this version to the 1951 ""Scrooge"" with Alastair Sim, but this one is so bad that it's pretty much impossible not to do so. Even the cartoon versions are better than this one. Some of the stories on here aren't bad, and Gene Lockhart as Bob Cratchit is good, as are his kids. But ultimately this movie really lacks the energy it needs to sustain such a story, especially the Marley character. There are too many important scenes that aren't even in this, while some of the other scenes are pure drivel.If this had been the first version I ever saw, I would never have watched another Scrooge or Christmas Carol ever again! Do yourself a HUGE favor and watch the 1951 version. Nobody can compare to Alastair Sim as Scrooge!"
1,Very Disappointing,"It's a free Kindle download, let's see if it was worth it...It wasn't. The characters weren't strong, the story was all over the place and the ending was stupid."
1,crap,"the stupid trains don't stay together. After an hour and a half setting it up and installing batteries and what-not, my 6 year old son came down and the trains just wouldn't stay attached. We spent more time trying to hook up the trains and put them back on the track then watching the train go half-way around the track."
1,Not worth the money.,"To make this review short and to the point. I threw the book in the garbage canhalf way through. This guy is out of touch with reality. If you don't think as he does, you should not be allowed to exist."
1,Terrible Product,"Worst purchase I've made in a while. The handset always unregisters from the base. The UI is fairly painful. It's super sluggish and crashes a lot. The call quality is terrible. And...the worst part...it doesn't interface with Skype on your computer?!?! So if you mistakenly have Skype on, running in your tray, you can't even use it. Ridiculous. Do not spend that much on a phone that doesn't work."
1,Scorses is Toast!,"Wow, let me tell you how disappointed I was in this Academy Award honored film. It is everything that is wrong with Hollywood today. The actors are the Lefty cadre of Babylon. You know them. They're in every IMPORTANT film, Leo, Matt, Jack, Alec, and Uncle Marty, the inner circle of the KGB. They rant off screen about poverty while unloading Hollywood gold into their vaults. They rant about environmental waste and drive a fleet of limos. But stop me before I puke. Can they act? Sometimes, but in the awful Hollywood school of the soulless-on-acid, I wish they would shut up and study old Humphrey Bogart films.Is this plot and the awful cop dialogue believable? NOOOOOO! And does that one love interest, Vera Farmiga, give you any skinny shivers at all? No! For a Harvard shrink, she comes off mousy and dumber than a brick. Who'd fall for her? Not me.Don't waste your time or money. Scorsese is toast."
1,Returned the product,"Radios reception was very poor, lots of static and weak signal. Poor quality speaker. Difficult to tune in single station as dial is so small. Rturned it almost immediately after use after receiving the radio."
1,Meh,"The MPAA sells vapid and disposable movies, this is just another movie that will soon be forgotten. I am not at all impressed by it, and I implore everybody to investigate the MPAA and their corporate lobbying and illegal use of coercion to get politicians and ordinary citizens alike to shut up and not have any opinions contrary to what Hollywood sells."
1,"""Sharpe's Gold""","I have literally just finished watching ""Sharpe's Gold"" on DVD, I don't have the words to describe my disappointment. It's story line was in such poor taste I had to immediately submit a review.My recent purchase of the Sharpes's series 1-6 has been shadowed by this absolutely horrible interpretation of the excellent book ""Sharpe's Gold"" by Bernard Cornwell. ""Sharpe's Gold"" the film would have made a much better ""Doctor Who"" episode. I consided myself a collector of the Sharpe series and have read the entire collection. I find it hard to believe that Bernard Cornwell actually allowed them to completely trash his book for his film.I will continue to collect the rest of this series, however my copy of ""Sharpe's Gold"" will be collected by the garbage men next Tuesday."
1,TOO LONG AND DRAGGED OUT,"I LOVE DRACULA. THIS MOVIE DID NO JUSTICE TO THE LEGEND. WIMONA RYDER WAS GOOD IN THIS ONE, BUT SHE AND GARY OLDMAN COULD NOT SAVE THIS. IT IS MORE OF A ROMANCE MOVIE THAN HORROR. IT SEEMED TO DRAG ON FOREVER. YOU WERE ACTUALLY FIND YOURSELF ROOTING FOR WINONA RYDERS CHARACTER TO STAY WITH DRACULA. I WAS BORED FROM THE BEGINNING AND WATCHED ONLY TO SEE IF IT WOULD GET BETTER. TO MY DISAPPOINTMENT IT DIDN'T. SAVE YOURSELF THE TIME AND AGONY OF NOT WATCHING THIS ONE."
1,Not a classic Salsa dance style,"I would not recommend this DVD for Salsa dance beginners who are used to the classic 123-567 lesson style. This DVD is only good for general Latin dance styles, not Salsa specific!"
1,"Carful when purchising from this seller, i was lied to.","I bought a Remastered, Bonus content Edition CD from this seller, and when it can it did not have the bonus content, If you about buying a CD from this seller, be carful you can be lied to."
1,Seatcover Review,"The seat covers are cute, but only 1 comes in a box and while I was putting them in my car one of them ripped! Obviously the quality is not very good."
1,this book is an ABOMINATION! Why not call it that?,"After having read parts of this abominable work (if you want to dignify it by calling it a ""work""), I wonder where is the role of the blessed Holy Spirit in the inspiration of Scriptures, and the drama of human events? And there wasn't a ""0-star"" option in the ratings block. Drosnin should come in contact with the Third Person of the Trinity, and then take this waste of paper off the market!"
1,"Ok, for a moment","Received this as a gift and only used it a few times with one child, and the seat broke. Called Saftey 1st and they want $20+ to replace the seat."
1,Difficult to use,"My grandson has a similar one that works great. This one won't work with rechargeable batteries and runs too fast to blow bubbles with a fresh battery. Overall, an annoying toy to use with a two year old."
1,A mediocre choice,"This blender, with the 10 speeds and low price (not to mention the quality reputation previously associated with Oster), lured me in. I've had mine for almost two years, and am still frustrated with its lack of mixing power. I make smoothies in mine and have to carefully stick a spoon in while it's mixing in order to get the top layer to mix with the bottom layer. Also, despite its high promises, it isn't worth a darn when you try to crush ice. I'm getting married in a few months and have added a different blender to our registry. Spend your money on better quality."
1,Disappointed,"I have a Pur and am very disappointed that I can't purchase the 950 anymore. Why did Pur replace the 950 with the lesser 950z?First, they got rid of the filter-life indicator.Second, but more importantly, NSF, a non-profit organization, does not certify the 950z for lead reduction but they did for the 950. Instead, Pur got the lead reduction certification somewhere else, from Pace Analytical Services. Note that Brita's filter *is* certified by NSF. Well, at least Pur did get the lead reduction certification from California's Dept of Health Services, which supposedly has stricter requirements than many other states.Third, the 950z does not reduce as many contaminants as the 950 though it still does so more than the Brita's."
1,"Garbage, Abanes is Scared of Mormons and Harry Potter???","Abanes successfully brings NOTHING NEW to the anti-Mormon movement. I AM ""Mormon"" and I know that Abanes is NOT being Christ like. Abanes and his writings are the furthest from the truth. He selectively takes portions of the history of the church and twists ""what he believes"" to be the truth and manipulates it to his anti-Mormon benefit to sell his book. ""It reads like a fast paced novel."" The funny thing is you people are buying into it. If you want to know more about ""Mormonism"" (The Church of JESUS CHRIST of Latter-day Saints) go to WWW.LDS.ORG and do your own homework. Do not be lazy and allow this one person to ""teach"" you and lead you astray. Beware of this man that tells you good is bad and bad is good."
1,More Crushed Dreams,"Initially Star Wars Galaxies had real potential for establishing a unique identity in the MMO world. However, this opportunity has been squandered. The game is being converted to just another First Person Shooter."
1,A rental at best (spoiler warning),"After falling asleep and being locked in the subway station Franka Potente and others are pursued and dispatched by a deformed maniac who curiously travels with his own entorage of rats. The acting is decent but the story is full of plot holes and cliches. The ""operation"" scene was creepy but too little too late to save the film. I suggest watching the alternate beginning which was a helpful backstory of the film but was unfortunately left out. It would have filled in some of the plot holes. If you are a horror fan like me then you will probably rent it anyway out of curiosity but you are probably better off watching it when it comes to the sci fi channel."
1,Booklet not a book,"This is a booklet.....28 pages long. For people familiar with plants,it is my opinion this book offers very little information that is not already available online. I am disappointed."
1,Pretty much same experience as C. Hamilton rater,"Purchased four from Amazon. No mention of them being refurbished, but price was suspiciously low ($199 vs. minimum of ~$420 anywhere else). As per C. Hamilton's experience, could not get them to work. Virtually no decent instructions available and no support. I even took it to the computer-geek place, and he put several hours into it, opening and trying two of the units. Could only get a very blurry image. He only charged me for one hour for the failed attempt, and I sent them back to Amazon. I really really hope they don't charge me some stupid fee for reboxing or over 30 days or something."
1,wrong color delivered-india!!!,"the belt, while nice, was the wrong color. the package said black, the pic showed black; the belt was maroon. try to get it taken care of...hah...amazon now fobs off it's customer sevice to india!!! try talking with them, try to understand them...amazon has my last dollar."
1,flimsy spoons,"In a nutshell, these spoons are not very sturdy. They bend WAY too easily... I would wager they would even bend while scooping out a stubborn wedge of grapefruit. The only reason I didn't give them 1 star is because they have a nice polished finish and are attractive to look at. Not recommended."
1,Art or propaganda?,Paul Laverty has produced a sensitive script about the relationship between two brothers who end up on different sides of the civil conflict in Ireland during the struggle for independence in the early 1920s. Unfortunately director Ken Loach has taken such an extreme pro-communist position (very few Irish at the time were communists) that the whole story becomes distorted into propaganda. A very sad waste of a good film. Extremely violent.
1,Skin Care Set,"I only use one tool in this whole kit and I spent over $32.00 on it. This was not a great buy, sorry seller."
1,A terrible event in whats been a terrible year,"The WWF has plain [bad] in 2001! Since about September 2000, maybe earlier, the WWF was on a downward spiral. It had become predictable and stale, and in 2001 it got much, much worse! Right now they are re-using old storylines, at Backlash they were basically just putting out new storylines but they were ultra predictable and boring. Usually they put on good action though despite the poor storylines, but Backlash failed. The whole card basically [was bad] except for the Hardcore Title match which was good but should have ran longer. People say Big Show & Shane was good, but it was in fact one of the poorest LMS matches ever! The big bump was the only good thing, except that Shane didn't actually touch big show. A really sh!t show compared to the high's of 2001 like WrestleMania and No Way Out."
1,VERY WEAK SEASON!! Stick with Season 1!,"MAAAN!! I bought this because many reviewers were saying that this season is the best and it has more action than season 1. BUT I GOT PULLED!! :(This second season of Knight Rider is SOOO BORING!! When it comes to the action scenes they get interrupted by blah!,blah!,blah! (actually, there is more talking than action), VERY few episodes are action-packed, the dvd doesn't contain to much extras, and there aren't that many driving stunts, chases and explotions as season 1. No wonder it was so cheap when I bought it at Spec's Music (10 bucks).Like I said, stick with Season 1! That is the one that is LOADED with action and dvd extras (including the tv movie Knight Rider 2000).Adios."
1,Tops the list of books to avoid during pregnancy,"If you have any interest in drug-free childbirth, homebirth, avoiding a c-section,or simply being empowered to understand your choices during birth, please pass right on by this one. Her characterization of ""natural childbirth moms"" as looking exhausted and unattractive after birth as compared the the perky, well-rested ones who chose drugs is not only offensive, but seriously, VERY unrealistic. Also please avoid this if you are offended by a wealthy white woman assuming she understands your experience, and giving you disempowering advice because she's your ""girlfriend."" Yes, I have a strong opinion about this book."
1,"I wanted to like this book, but reading it was a chore","There's probably a good 300-page book hidden somewhere in this bloated 500-page tome. The idea of reconciling crimes and causes of the past with those of the present is an interesting one, there are some clever plot twists and the flashback scenes are fun. But every time the story switches to the present, boy, do things begin to drag. The characters bear little resemblence to their former selves, and it is hard to work up much concern about what happens to them. They tend to drone on and whine about themselves for pages and pages and pages. When the end finally comes, you're just glad to be rid of them"
1,Pointless as well as Plotless,"Unfortunately this is a terrible book. I simply cannot for the life of be believe that Frank Miller wrote this. Of all the stuff he has written this is by far his worst. Hey, I even like his much malaigned The Dark Knight Strikes Again, but this is just ridiculous.Batman is written to be some absurd caped crusader that keeps on called Spawn a punk. Batman has seriously lost his marbles in this book. Spawn, ironically enough, is portrayed much more human than his counterpart.The plot involves some absurd story of doctors using robots and voodoo. I kid you not.Frank what happened?"
1,THESE DON'T WORK WELL,At least for me they don't. They either slip down my legs if the straps are loose or they cut off circulation when the straps are tightened. There doesn't seem to be a middle ground. When the pads are on my knee(without cutting off the blood to my feet) they are comfortable.
1,Helpful but Not Entirely Practical nor Complete,"While this booklet provided a good outline for our LLC to begin its discussions, it was not nearly complete enough to prevent complicated legal problems faced down the road and at the conclussion of the LLC. I highly recommend that ever group that is not simply a husband & wife type of operation seek professional legal advise and have the LLC set up with proper formal legal documents. It will save a lot of hard feelings AND MONEY in the long run."
1,Product Not Pictured,I am actually pretty angry about this. I used to have that exact cup holder and loved it. When it finally broke after several years I have tried to find a replacement. I ordered this thinking I had finally found it. What I received was a standard cup holder I could have bought for $2 at any autoparts store. Naturally I have returned it and am disappointed at Amazon for allowing the wrong product to be pictured.
1,This is what the music industry has become,"What can I say about this ""music"" CD? When Morrisey and Paul Weller can't get played, or in some cases, even a record contract in America, and yet Mr. Hung is a ""star"", there is something seriously wrong. I watch a basketball game and see this young man singing, and yet I can't remember the last time I saw Radiohead on TV, but there's a difference. Mr. Hung is all hype, and in a couple of months when we're talking about Mr. Hung in the same breath as the infamous Gerardo and Right Said Fred, company he so richly deserves. So I say viva William Hung, do everything you can now, because my watch says 14:59."
1,i didn't care for it,"This sounds like generic laid back funk more than electronic dance music ... didn't much care for it, sorry. Shoulda listened to the samples I guess."
1,PC MumboJumbo,"I read, and used in a history class, this author's first book in this set so I ordered this one to add to my personal library. It is not worth the purchase due to the pc insertions that were hard to ignore."
1,$.50 cost per pop added by required refill parts,"Okay, my title is a little wonky. Couldn't figure out how to say it in one line, but if you buy this, it will work. It'll make plain ol' fashioned popcorn with no added oils in the microwave. That's the good part.That bad part is that it's not quite so apparent from the description that you're going to have to use the paper concentrators for every single popping. You can't change it out every 3 or 4 poppings, you're going to use 1 each and every time you pop. And they cost about $4.29 per 8, plus shipping. So if you've got Amazon prime and free shipping, you're still adding at least 50 cents cost to each batch of popcorn. Doesn't seem so economical after all, huh?Also, you can't just run to your local store and get more concentrators, so you'll have to think ahead or stock up. And God forbid they stop making them anymore, you'll have a useless hunk of plastic. I'm glad mine was a gift."
1,bad disk little help.,The third disc side 2 of the box it has no info on it won't play it all and I can't figure out how to get a return!
1,Cracka,This product seller is terrible!!! The screen came in broken and cracked. I would not recommend this product to any one. I should be callin the owner and demand another one
1,Kindle edition is full of typos,"The book is excellent. See the other reviews for details. However, the conversion to Kindle format has riddled the manuscript with typographical errors, misspellings, missing words, and omitted spaces. I would never have bought it had I any idea of how poor the editing job was. If you want this book, buy the paper edition instead."
1,Foil split in a week,After just 3 uses the foil split in two. I thought this shaver would do the job and the price was not as bad as some local beauty stores. It does NOT give a close shave either. Have to say this was a waste. With I had a zero star option
1,sentimental tripe,"Starting with a horrific crime, this book starts out as a good mystery but quickly becomes a sentimental cloying image of heaven. I was sickened by the crime, then sickened by the rest of the novel. It seemed to be a sort of combination of the movie Seven with the television series Touched by an Angel. Give me a break."
1,Unenlightened,"The whole story is cliched and predictable. Even Krauss' reflective writing style too often draws on overused metaphors. There seems to be a repetition in the characters introduced; attractive, young, fragile females or father-figure males.The mysterious philosophy of self and memory is not conveyed as well as it could be, leaving the reader unenlightened.The ending is somewhat unsatisfactory.In the novel's credit, the epilogue is beautiful- although the save comes too late.In any case it keeps you reading right til the very unsatisfying end."
1,"It's a four-letter word, all right","The Good - Al Pacino versus Robert DeNiroThe Bad - Val KilmerThe Ugly - A Michael Mann filmAnd the winner is...no drum roll needed here...the ugly. Michael Mann can't stop sucking. No surprise there.We begin with minimal dialogue and exposition through words, a MM trademark. Then they did finally ""act"" and were howlingly bad, another MM trademark. The writing, the delivery, and the overblown ""action"" scenes. Give me a medal for lasting 15 minutes. Okay, 10. It felt like many more. Please, MTV, give MM a job before he films again."
1,Disapointed with the company,"I was very disapointed when I recieved the shoes with the ink tag still on them. From what I understand it happens a lot with this company. Then to learn I would have to return the shoes, wait for them to crdit my account, and re purchase them. Instead of the company just removing the ink tag."
1,"not as good as the ""Company of Rogues"" books","Nowhere near as good as the ""Company of Rogues"" books. Full of meaningless dialogue and long, boring sections of the character's thoughts. Entire pages should have been edited out as unnecessary."
1,A tragedy to all fans of the show!!!!,"As it's been written previously...this is not the complete first season! I brought it before there were any reviews and now I feel robbed. I'm a big fan of the series but I'm reluctant to purchase any more of the so called ""COMPLETE"" anything from this otherwise wonderful show. This is not the way you treat fans!"

1,Just plain BAD.,"After enduring 12 minutes of this movie I had to turn it off. I was awful. The acting was terrible and the storyline was all over the place. As someone who loves independant, low budget Indie films, it takes a lot for me to criticize movies on a shoestring budget. The low budget was not the problem here....it was everything else about it. What are Bradley Cooper's ""people"" thinking about allowing this to be re-released. So BAD."
1,Not sturdy,"If your good with putting on things smoothly, then this is for you. Me on the other hand had some difficulties since it's so sticky and like plastic, it keeps scrunching together."
1,Can't wear under pants.,"I'm sorry to say I had to send this item back since it is too bulky to be worn under pants. Before I bought the product I did read another review that said this same thing, but I bought it anyway so I could see for myself. The other reviewer was correct."
1,Top burn broke does not work,"At first I was completely delighted to have a real toaster. It seemed to have a mind of its own and know exactly how long to toast without burning. Then within the first year the top electrical element stop working and the company refused to provide a replacement (I was several months out of warranty, but used machine only modestly). Base on the companies unwillingness to replace or take responsibility for a faulty appliance, I would recommend staying away from buying Sanyo products."
1,One of the dumbest ideas ever,"The books represents that a mathematical observation is to some extent dependent on the culture of the observer. This is, at best, a misrepresentation. An equilateral triangle does not change in properties, no matter what the culture of the observer. Two + Two will always equal four. One of the most useful aspects of mathematics is that it is not relative to the culture of the observer. What is mathematically true remains true. If two observers do not agree about a mathematical property, one is wrong or incomplete. It may be that it is the European view that is wrong, I am sure that not all mathematical truth is known yet. It may never be. What is true about mathematical observation is not variable with culture."
1,Worst Game On The Market,"This game is horrible; don't buy it. I wouldn't even spend four bucks to rent this weak excuse for a video game. The graphics are mighty retro--they rock if you dig stuff from 1984. As for me, I like graphics that look as good as Tony Hawk 2 on Playstation. Also, the controls make no sense, and you have to read the instruction booklet cover to cover just to figure out how to make some goofy looking dude build a hut or something. This game is wack, get Frogger 2 instead."
1,Totally disappointing,"If you're looking for a slick white shredder that does everything it claims to do, this is NOT the machine for you. It's NOT white (it's an odd old-plastic color), it does NOT shred 7 pages at a time like it's supposed to, and it DOES decide to stop working altogether for absolutely no reason at all. If it was worth my time I'd return it, but considering this is the second one they shipped me and the first one was even worse, I'm totally OVER IT."
1,"Not 14 miles, 1.4 miles","Sorry Midland,1.4 miles, but not 14.I didn't know false advertising was legal.These radios perform no better than my 2 mile radios."
1,Flipper Defect Nightmare,"Universal decided to put flippers back on the market rather than pack in a DVD copy into a 2 disc case. Ooooh. Bad move. No more disc art, defective discs everywhere (rampant reports of Bourne Identity freezing for 15 seconds during a car chase are already surfacing). Universal executives, if you are watching....PLEASE STOP THE FLIPPERS. THEY WERE BAD IN DVD DAYS. THEY ARE BAD NOW. Pack in the DVD with the blu ray in the future, your end-of-year bonus check and family will thank you"
1,The greatest disappointement of my life,"One thing is to write a fictional work, another is to completely change the known history.This book should be in a alternate history listing. Since the death of Marius to the education of Caesar, the history of Rome itself, all is too wrong to be read by someone who has no knowledge of history and that may believ in these lies.I read only half of the book, the plot is weak, the author knows nothing, but I mean really nothing about history.Even children should not read it"
1,A Mother Runs Off with a Rock Star and Leaves Her Children Behind,"This book is poorly conceived. The plot is fragmented, the writing awkward, and the characterization is superficial and contrived. Overall, it was a big disappointment.The novel is about a woman who leaves an abusive husband and her two daughters to run off with a rock star. The rock star dies and she returns to the small Georgia town she left in order to reconcile with her children.I recommend readingBastard out of Carolina: (Plume Essential Edition)by Allison instead of this. 'Bastard Out of Carolina' is a fine book that is beautifully written."
1,Give me back my two hours,"A total waste of time. The movie tries to evince some deep metaphor about euthanasia or something, or forgiveness or something, I don't know. It's nothing worth making a movie about, that's all I know.It's also creepy how this movie seeks to portray a high school football coach who is a pediphiliac homosexual in a positive light. Ugh. Utterly, downright creepy. What's creepier are all the positive reviews here. Wow, this collapsing amoral culture is in a lot of trouble.This movie didn't merit my troubling myself to review it with any more specifics that that. I'm sorry I sat through the whole thing.It's utterly bleak and hopeless, as well as perverted. Blech!"
1,CHINESE CRAP,"The digital compass is a typical Chinese product. Flimsy plastic. The item received does not look like the item I ordered. It was supposed to come with a lanyard, which it didn't. When I tried to string a lanyard that I had, through the VERY tiny hole, I actually heard the plastic casing crack.Stay away from this product."
1,"Get the CD, not the download","I got the download version, when I got to the download, a program called Appstream had to be installed. I thought it was some kind of download manager. If it were only that! It automatically installed PM, I could not change the install path. Then came the next surprise: if I want to start PM, it automatically starts IE and I have to logon to Broderbund to use PM! Then I wanted to uninstall Appstream and it uninstalled PM too! What a piece of ... The worst part is that it is advertised as ""Smart download""...total mislead."
1,Bumper sticker=spoiled whiny drivers,"It won't let me rate with no stars.Beating is wrong. Spanking on the behind is a very useful tool in raising a person with a good character, unselfish behavior, and a person who strives to be fair to others in their endeavors. People who don't like spanking have either never been disciplined or have been subject to the abusive side of discipline.Also, if you don't have children you can't accurately give an opinion.When looking at a group of children you can see who is well disciplined and who isn't by their relationship with their peers. Those who are spanked are more pleasurable to be around. The unspanked usually are the spoiled, want their own way, whiny children. Step back and take a look around you."
1,this kid goes to my school,This kid goes to my school. He bit a teacher after she took some stickers away from him. Then he went running past my classroom. The principle chased him in the parking lot while the whole school watched. I'm sick of him.
1,Pantera is awesome,pre hibernation is the only song on the album i will listen to. because it is cool and it is by Pantera (one of my favorite bands).
1,Amazon subcontractor shipped wrong product,"i am growing increasingly dissatisfied with amazon's subcontractor sellers. chronic common problems: items ship very very late with no notice or update, and the credit card is charged with no shipment. 100% of my several inquiries have all been the shippers negligence."
1,"was going to buy, but not now","I was planning to buy one for my wife for her birthday. Not now. I guess Amazon can ""take back"" any book that I purchase for her. Nice. ""Happy Birthday, Honey . . . now give back all those e-books I bought for you."""
1,Misleading description,"I purchased this wine bucket solely because the description showed its shipping weight as 5.7 pounds. When it arrived the package seemed very light and turned out to be 1 pound 12 ounces. This wine bucket is very light and thin stainless steel, nowhere near the weight advertised. Nevertheless the design is satisfactory and I assume it will fulfill its function. The price is right."
1,worst ever,"This one of the worst electric teakettle I have used. Please people don't buy it if you don't want fire on your hands. First of all, you need quite enough might to close lid shut. You may think you closed it but in reality you don't, you have to push it down very hard. Second of all, the filter dislodges very easily. These two reasons are the main cause of automatic shut off function not to shut off at all. So you pour the water put the kettle on and off you go. And you know what- you may came back and notice that plastic kettle almost on a verge of melting because current wasn't shut down by shut off function since filter dislodged itself or lid wasn't really closed or both and it is boiling and boiling and boiling. Very dangerous product indeed."
1,Oh look - a false martyr!!,"Does it even matter that after polic reports and countless eye-witness accounts that it has been proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that Rachel Scott was not killed for her belief in god? Well it should. Burn this book, it's a sham.Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris are not hateful anti-god monsters, but if it makes it easier for her mother and others to accept the tragedy - go ahead, let them indulge in their lies.In search of better reading try 'No Easy Answers: the Truth Behind Death at Columbine' or the police report available through investigating police department"
1,Small,Too small even for small wrists. Not happy with it. The furry things made it even harder to work with and didn't make it any more comfortable.
1,I Am Also Disappointed,"I was going to buy this Blu-Ray set like most people initially until I learned it did not include the extended edition. Every dollar counts in this economy, so I will be saving my hard earned money for the version that should of been included."
1,DO NOT BUY,"It simply will not fit on my lens (see many other reviews with the same compalint). It fits nicely when inverted for storage. But when you need it, it will encroach upon your field and you will have to take it off. There is about a 20-30 degree off-set when you ""seat it"". Throwing it away is cheaper than sending it back.Just like Vizzini ( The Princess Bride) didn't know what ""inconceivable"" meant......nor do I believe that this company knows what ""Precision"" means...."
1,Zzzzzz....,"I'm desperately trying to get through this book. It's full of German language and history...not a bad thing but makes it quite difficult to follow. Thus far (nearly halfway through the book), I have yet to find anything compelling to keep me reading it."
1,deceptive image,I purchased a Calvin Klein denim comforter about two years ago and it was denim on both sides. Mr. Klein seems to have decided to scrimp on costs and now has denim on only one side of the comforter. It's like you are getting only half of what you thought you were paying for. Very disappointed.
1,US Studio Does Nausicaa Terrible Injustice,"I saw 'Warriors of the Wind' and felt it was an amazing film. Then I saw the original, uncut 'Kaze no Tani no Naushika' and thought, my god - what had they done. This is a landmark film that cannot truely be appreciated in its edited version. New World Pictures felt it could only be marketed as a kid's action movie, so they cut out about a quarter of the movie (the parts they felt were ""slow moving"") and garbled the storyline in the process. [Writer/Director] Miyazaki was horrified when he found out what they had done to his film, and Ghibli [studios] asks everyone to forget that this version ever existed. Fortunately, New World Video's rights to Nausicaä expired in 1995. The distribution rights are now held by Disney, who did a nice job on 'Princes Mononoke'. One can only hope they will do as well with Nausicaä."
1,Not even worth the ...,Its quite obvious why this is a ... title. Basically a very mediocre RPG. You can only play as one character and one player and the graphics will bring back memories of your Atari 5200.
1,Not recommended...,"I bought this ball not even a year ago, only use it maybe every other 3 days or so and it got a big tear in it. I'm the only only one who used it, don't understand why it would get a 3-4mm hole it it??? Disappointed because it cost so much..."
1,Dangerous drivel,"""I really love it when he hurts me, hurts me"": how can grown human beings put out this kind of dangerous drivel? Worse, it has that catchy nursery-rhyme type hook so of course all the kids are gonna be singing it, learning that sex is supposed to be painful for women, and that girls are basically receptacles for male genitalia. I'm saddened and disgusted that a record company whould release something as offensive as this, and even more saddened that it's a top 10 hit. Where are your minds, people? What do you think this is telling our children? What if, instead of rhymes about hurting women, it were about people of color? Would you notice then?"
1,NO STARS,....wow. they tell me to review an item that i havent received. so im giving them 0 stars on their service and item. (i never received the item that i payed for.) dont get this item. they wont send it to you
1,Purchase of CD,"I purchased the CD and it was delivered in the appropriate time, however the CD was blank. I was required to return it and bore that expense. While the company did refund the purchase price, it did not refund the cost of returning the item. After all of my efforts and expense I still do not have a serviceable CD. I would not order from this company again."
1,Trash,"I bought two of these, and neither CD player worked for long. I bought them 4 years ago, so maybe they fixed the problem - but I doubt it, as I see the other reviews. I'm shocked they are still being sold!"
1,Poor Heat Resistance for the Grill,Maybe these are good for loading wood into a fireplace but they are not very protective if you have anything very hot on the grill. I was using a steel vegetable basket on the grill and when I went to remove it with this mitt it started to burn through the mitt in seconds.Pick up the seven dollar black Webber grill mit intead. I couldn't feel the heat at all when I picked up the vegetable basket using that mitt.
1,Forever tarnished gold,"This is NOT the Drifters-- maybe it's ""The Drifter"" and a bunch of fill-ins. Bottom line is: these re-recordings are VERY bad! Don't waste your time on this one."
1,This Is NOT The 'Fire & Ice' By Ralph Bakshi,"This film is a docu about nature, not the cartoon. Dont order this if you are looking for the Bakshi/Frazetta cartoon. It is out-of-print."
1,Kull disjointed,The advance ads implied this was a single story rather than a disjointed review and groups of unlinked stories
1,Ummmm,"Yes it is a functioning, blue, 25 ft ethernet cord. The problem? Trying to unplug the cord is nearly impossible. The plastic sheath over the tab that would allow you to remove the cord is too rough, and doesn't even help unplug the cord. It in fact makes it harder to unplug. The tab itself hurts to unplug. You will spend at least 5 minutes and use some lego pieces in order to try to free the plug.I asked to return it and they require me to pay for the return. I paid $3.44 for this product, and to ship it back costs $3.50. So...yeah.Don't buy this if you ever plan on moving or unplugging it from the modem ever."
1,Not as advertised,"Specs listed an optical out - the unit I received didn't have one. Otherwise it seemed ok, but I needed the optical out so I returned it."
1,Poor DVD quality,"The first and last thirds of the movie are Ok -- not great quality -- but the middle third hangs up time after time. You must fast forward to get it past the ""bad spot"" and then resume watching. But you can't go back and watch or listen to the piece that you've missed or it hangs up (freezes) again."
1,Whoz to blame?,I'm surprised that Limp Bizkit has gotten this bad.They were bad before and getting worse.Maybe something will come to them and they'll clean up their act before their next CD. (Hopefully)As for this CD if you Buy it be perpared to put it in the trash.
1,Not a favorite,"Charlie (aka Charlotte), the main character, is not a super-sympathetic character. I did not root for her like I rooted for Bridget Jones or Rebecca from the Shopaholic books. She is one of the most narcissistic and pretentious main characters I've ever read in the genre of the ""chick lit"" novel. The romance between her and Hank was obviously going to go nowhere, and it took a heck of a long time to play it out and I did not care one iota whether she succeeded in the filmmaking world.The author has the potential for a better novel next time as '...Technicolor' was readable despite the problems I had with the story."
1,Did not meet up to my expectation,I was expecting more information in this book about dreams. I am no way closer to understanding dreams than I was prior to reading this book.
1,Horrible!!,"I have read almost all of the FR novels that have been written to date. This is without a doubt the worst one. Every other novel in the setting has been great. Some start slow, but they are always good. This one, I read and read, and kept waiting for it to get good. One month later (and a couple of good books in the middle to break up the boredom) and I was at the end. It just never got good. The only reason I bothered finishing it, is that I kept waiting for something to happen. Without a doubt one of the most boring books I have ever read. If there were negative stars to give out, I would do it for this one."
1,another front focussing copy...,"I tested it and it was front focussing quite badly. I don't have the nerve to send camera and lens to Sigma for calibration, so back to Amazon it went. I'll stay with Canon lenses."
1,Tips break off in styrofoam!,"Tips broke off in styrofoam target block. And since the tips are wider than the arrow shaft, the tips get stuck in the styrofoam - some ""surgery"" with needle nosed pliers to retrieve tips. Happened numerous time on new arrows. Not worth the money."
1,Flimsy at best,It did not fit the pool even though it was designated for the exact pool we own. It never tied down properly and the wind would frequently take it off of the pool entirely which defeated the point of having it.
1,"Enjoyed ""The Flanders Panel"" better.","After having enjoyed ""The Flanders Panel"", I was looking forward to ""The Club Dumas"", and was hooked by the first chapter. I found the storylines of bibliophiles, the occult, and especially the possible forgery of the books intriguing. However, it all fell apart after the revelation of the sham Club Dumas, and just got worse when the final plotlines were revealed. I found the ending to be unclear and convoluted. Readers would be much better off reading ""The Eight"" by Katherine Neville. However, I still intend to give ""The Seville Communion"" a try."
1,"If you are a Gamer, look elsewhere","I enjoy gaming. I have my computer hooked up to my 62"" TV. I bought this combo so I could game in comfort. I am located about 5 feet from the BT receiver. The keyboard loses connection about every 3rd time and takes at least 3 seconds sometimes more to come out of sleep mode (which it goes into very quickly). You'd think with such a fast sleep mode setting it wouldn't suck batteries so bad. I have to replace the batteries every 3-4 days in both the keyboard and mouse. The mouse lags which makes it about impossible to play anything timed or MMO style. It works moderately well for just everyday stuff like checking email and surfing the web (if you can get past the poor battery life and disconnects). Hopefully someday a company will step up and make a combo that really works."
1,Save your money. Product does NOT work,"This product did absolutely NOTHING to the silver solder on my copper pieces. I am very disappointed. Unfortunately, I will stick with plating with pickle."
1,Skip this one,"I wouldn't call this book a manual of woodworking, I'd call it a manual synopsis of 20 year old tools. All this book does is tell you about the various tools used in woodworking in the 1980's, and it does so with a pretentious tone. My favorite part of the book is the section about this new tool called the cordless drill; the author seems to think these heavy and cumbersome tools are just a flash in the pan trend. Save your money by using google to find woodworking blogs."
1,Reboot City,"Love this game, but hate the glitches. I have to reboot my computer after every gameplay session. Like many others who have written reviews, I too just purchased a brand new computer, yet still have problems making NOLF2 run smoothly. I hope Sierra is listening! Back to Vice City, which runs flawlessly."
1,Worst...movie...ever,"I've made it a point to try and see as many of the films in the IMDB 'bottom 150'. I wasn't surprised to see <I> The Omega Code </I> in that esteemed list. It's a dreadful film that hasn't found any niche. Born-again fundamentaloonies never took to it because it isn't 'biblically accurate.' Most sane people dismissed it off-hand. If it didn't completely bomb at the box office, it's because of it's 'limited theatrical release' and the fact that it was [messed with]so well by TBN. Now there's your 2.7 mil at the box office. The TBN crowd (read: instant gratification evangeloonies) flocked to see this croaker. They also put money in Benny Hinn's pockets. Enough said.Well, it didn't take me long to get a hold of this. Most video stores have this stored away somewhere. This is pure MST2K stuff, people. The acting is wooden, the plot is nonsensical and it's just totally pointless. Was this supposed to make me drop to my knees and praise the Lord?I was too busy laughing. Avoid!"
1,Not recommended,"Whoever said the CD isn't as fun as the demo is completely right. There are several features in the demo, like many upgrades available to the stand, that aren't included in the real game, which kind of pissed me off. I haven't played it since the first day I bought it because of the features that were left out. I would NOT recommend buying this game, if only because of the deceit of the demo."
1,These are not Aimco,"These came marked as some other brand, I needed them that day so I had to use them I threw the box away so now I don't remember who made them but they are not Aimco premiums."
1,"Rating is for this version ,not the Concert","I have a borrowed copy so I am not bitter about buying this CHEAP rehash. Director's cut... means what? We all know that Woodstock was a groovy phenomenon - there's no debate there, and the positive reviews for this product are giving credit where its due. However, if I was a consumer I would be enraged. As another viewer mentioned, the sub titles are in places hysterically inaccurate- Couldn't the producers of this version hire a fact checker? Additionally- there are no extras at all, and the two sided disc is not mentioned anywhere. The dvd just cuts off and turns to black while CSN are still talking. I thought something happened to my TV. ( yeah man, the cats that put together this version were just not being cool - and that's not me just rappin' with a negative vibe- ya dig? Don't waste your bread man.) See the movie, just don't buy this version."
1,Raging piece of garbage,"Stay away from this badly designed, badly written program. Yes, it does everything advertised but it is horrendously convoluted, non-intuitive, and frquently crashes the entire machine. I've never seen a piece of software that burns so much produciton time carrying out the simplistic funcitons that this program tries to provide. If you are looking for business software that will streamline the way you do things & help make you more productive, this is not it. If you buy it, you're wasting your money. If you use it already, you're wasting time, you can do much better than this garbage."
1,Beak On First Use,"I never write a review on Amazon.com or anywhere online. But this item totally deserve to be reviewed!I was so looking for my purchase on Amazon. It finally arrived today, but... it broke into two pieces on my first use.DON'T BUY !"
1,UGH!! THQ....?,"I always been a fan of thq wrestling since N64 and I own DAY OF RECKONING 1 & 2 on gamecube and I liked them,friday I picked up smackdwon vs 2007.Sigh...and I took it back monday morning,ok when I fought I got knocked down with a weak grapple only to tap the life out of my fingers trying to get back up...you spend too much d@*n time on the mat,horrible controls,even if looking in the book,SOOOO not much FUN< sucks A*$!!"
1,True: It never happened; Another bad example.,"It's an insult to us veterans, and esp. cavalry troopers, for hollyweird to sludge ahead w/ farb films, when they known darn well it's a lie! Viewers should not support same w/ their dollars. The shameful treatment of the WWI vets of the Bonus Army, however, could have been better documented, and offered as entertainment also! Political pressures are part of American military history, but outright falsehoods of PC bunk have no place in it. Remember this when you think about governance, and head for the polls.Sgt. Gary A. Hurd, 26th U.S. Cavalry Philippine Scouts MR, Horse: 1913-1941; Restored 2003-Pres."
1,Not a cute gingham,"I ordered these curtains for my daughter's room b/c her quilt to her crib set and the bumper has squares of different colored gingham, but I was very disappointed with these curtains. The gingham squares were relatively large and the yellow was pretty bright and not a soft baby colored yellow as I expected it to be. I'm sending them back and I'm very disappointed."
1,"not the ""be all to end all.""","""What to Expect When You're Expecting"" has a lot of contradictions in advice, which turned myself and my husband off. The ""worst case scenarios"" got to be really old as well. To be honest, I haven't opened this book since week 4 and we're at week 16.The book my husband and I preferred was ""Pregnancy- Week by Week."" We have gotten into the habit of snuggling together, as my husband reads about what changes are occurring for this particular week."
1,SUCKS ...,"This game sucks. The 2008 game was great, save your money, this is crap. don't buy it. I want my money back. Not worth the time to open the box it came in."
1,Worst I have had,"Bought to replace Instapure filter. Not happy. Did not last 1/2 as long. Flow slows to a trickle within a month. Also extremely hard to open to replace cartridge, Used up 4 cartridges in 4 months. Returning to Instapure when final one expires (i.e. flow becomes drip. PUR obviously makes its profits on replacement cartridges."
1,Not as easy as it looks.,The Deluxe Sock Aid is not designed as easy as it looks. My mother found it to be cumbersome and ackward.
1,They do not Leak...they Pour!,"Here is our experience: The nice thing about Avent is they are very easy to clean, but the mess they make isn't. This is our first time using Avent bottles. I did not use Avent with our first two children and I never experienced the leaking with their bottles as I am with the Avent bottles. The leaking doesn't happen right away. It begins about two weeks after you have been using the product. It doesn't just leak, it pours out! Of course, I thought we were just over tightening or not pulling the nipple all the way through the ring, but that was not the problem. Please note that Avent has an extensive page on their web-site regarding trouble-shooting for leaky bottles. That speaks for itself. One should not have to manipulate or figure out how to screw a nipple onto a bottle, no matter if it's 3:00 in the morning, out shopping or at home in the middle of the afternoon."
1,"Uncomfortable Fit, Mediocre Sound","The Sony MDR-IF3000 headphones have average sound quality and are very uncomfortable to wear. Perhaps, if one were an elf or a small child, they would fit properly; however, if you're like me, a mere adult mortal, they probably won't fit you.They would be okay for simple stereo listening, but not the kind of superlative sound experience suggested in the description. If you're looking for a solid pair of headphones for casually listening to music or watching your favorite movie, the SONY MDR-IF8000 are vastly superior headphones and well worth the extra money."
1,Henley messes up yet again!,"Steamy sex, pretty clothes, and historical figures are no substitute for Henley's flagrant disregard for history. She compresses the events of a decade into two years and comes out looking like a rank amateur in the process. Her hero is an obnoxious beast without respect for the heroine, a young lady much too easily overcome by hormones to think in a coherent manner. Several historical innacuracies were enough for me to be disgusted overall by this incredibly bad book!"
1,It doesn't perform as advertised - don't waste your money!,"The VideoWave 5.0 box got me very excited to try video editing and DVD burning, but it is a waste of money. I couldn't do the most basic task of capturing video from my DV camera because the audio was all garbled. When I used good video captured using better programs from Ulead, it had audio synch problems - meaning the voice is not matching the moving lips. The DVD burning feature also doesn't work with the DVD+RW format, which is the best format for home DVD player compatibility. ..."
1,Total crap,"It's a shame we can't give less than 1 star. This book is slanderous, like most of the right-wing hate literature and conservative pulp fiction that gets published these days. Don't waste your time or your money unless you're looking for a poorly written piece of fiction ""based on real events""."
1,"What you can do, not what you should do",A visually appealing book that shows off many digital effects and possible ways of creating digital diagrams. Whether or not you should do some of the things shown is another matter.This book is not for the serious Information Architect - but may be useful for a designer or graphic artist.Read Tufte and Wainer first - but then you won't find much new or useful here.
1,Over the top fluff!,"Pearl Harbour is a big budget special effects offering from you guessed it Jerry Bruckheimer responsible for such over the top Hollywood films as Armageddon. Micheal Bay director of Bad Boys and The Rock helms this box office terror of a film. Starring one of the worst actors of all time Ben Affleck, the film starts well but ends up in cornville.What could be a powerful movie after the tragic events that took place in Pearl Harbour about sixty years ago is just an excuse to spend money on high quality effects. Pearl Harbour is a no brainer. Stay away please!"
1,"Nice looking, but couldn't wear it!","This is a nice looking lanyard, however, it pulled the hair on my neck and I couldn't wear it more than 5 minutes. I had to return the item. On the plus side, customer service was very friendly."
1,WHAT A NICE LITTLE PEACE OF FROZEN UP JUNK,"Only had this for a week and just like the other customers stated about it freezing up, that's what it did for me and it's just what it does best. It freezes. Someone said that it can always be reset. BULL! I didn't pay what i'd paid for it to reset it time and time again. Take it from me and other customers, do NOT buy this, you will end up returning it to the store."
1,Absolute tosh: says more about Cornwell than Sickert,"I can't think of another character assassination that is as unfounded as this, based as it is on pure conjecture and highly selective and inconclusive 'evidence'.And just think of the irony of a writer who has based her entire written output on lingering over the sordid details of murder and mutilation claiming that Sickert was a violent psychopath because of the subject-matter of his paintings. Talk about the pot calling the kettle black!This book reveals more about the neuroses and obsessions of Cornwell's own sick mind than it does about Sickert. Rather than 'case closed' on Sickert, it is 'case closed' on Cornwell.Cornwell's reputation as a writer of FICTION remains intact."
1,Warning: This will harm you and your computer,"Worthless, miserable piece of crap. This machine just jammed up my computer and has NEVER worked properly. Utterly worthless and the technical service from Iomega is abysmal. Only buy this machine if you are looking for an expensive paperweight and you love spending your life on hold calling technical support lines populated by morons"
1,"Wierd Story, plot.","A surrealistic plot which jumps between fantasy and realism. Not the best Goddard book I've read. In fact, I didn't finish it."
1,disaster,We expected this book to be a comprehensive description that the title said. We have such a book purchased previously. This book was a mere condensation of that which we wanted. It is useless! it is a waste of money! it is a misrepresentation!
1,Boring,Bridge of San Luis Rey is a really boring movie. Such an excellent cast is wasted on a slow movie that's an aweful period piece.
1,Another burnt out B&D heatgun,"Borrowed it from the neighbor, it burned out after two days of use, perhaps 4 hours runtime. As the other reviews here say, ""junk"" -- don't waste your money."
1,Not exhaustive or applicable,"I'm facing bankruptcy. This book has lots of scenarios, most very general, and useless to my financial situation. I'm one of the millions working poor buying books to support multi-million dollar authors and this habit has become a financial burden. This is one that will go back to the stores. For those facing hard financial choices highly recommend Surviving Financial Disasters (for the cut throat truth about a way out), The Autmatic Millions (for hope) and The richest man in Babylon (for a good read)."
1,pure trash!,"I saw this in the theater & hated it! I was almost sick!! The only part of it that did make sense was they were actually chipmunk size. While in the cartoon they're about the size of 7-8 year old kids. Still modernizing the costumes I can see plausable but removing the aspect of Alvins signiture red ball cap? All 3 have Sassy additudes, Don't seem to mind giving Dave grief and trouble, are self centered and don't have that looking out for each other bond that made them endearing on TV. Not to mention alot of bathroom humor and sexual jokes. Like I sad Trash!!! I would not recomend this to anyone!"
1,A mish-mashed laundry list of griping and whining. Ugh!,"In fifty years of reading (sometimes 2 or 3 books a day), as an academic, a newspaper editor and someone who enjoys a good sexual romp, I did something I've never done in my entire life--I returned this waste of paper. No sense inflicting it on a friend. Not only is it so badly written as to be laughable, Abagnalo seems to take his weird gripes and paranoid fantasies to extremes, spending most of his time riffing on personal notions of exaggerated cruelties--from his father, his mother, his 'friends,' acquaintances, strangers, institutions. What a bore. The most titillating moment was when I was able to turn to the last page and put an end to both our suffering. This book is one long enema."
1,Terrible,Short & Sweet.....all six cartridges were dried up the day I received them! Not one was any good! Factory originals for me from now on!
1,Biased Author,I hoped to learn about bombing as a military/social tactic and instead felt I received a pacifist-distorted view. If he changed the title to 'All war is Bad' it would be more apropos to the content. Also they are guilty of evaluating historical behavior with a contemporary viewpoint instead of in context. For a citizen of a country that sat out WWII to accuse others of deliberately attacking the wrong targets in Germany is untenable. Makes me ashamed of my Swedish heritage but proud my ancestors left.
1,as if!,"this book is really confusing, boring, and a waste of time and money .. oh yeah and the author is a jerk!"
1,I should have splurged.,"I bought this because it was the cheapest tape deck adapter on Amazon. It performs like it. The cord is thin and feels like I may break it easily. The sound quality is subpar. My cheapo Wal Mart brand adapter sounded great, it was as good through the car speakers as a CD. With this unit, I get static, hissing, pops, and scratchy audio. Also, somehow, the levels are off. I've had to tweak all the settings on my stereo to make my music even passable. I will be replacing this one at my earliest opportunity, and recommend you spend a couple bucks more."
1,the burning times,"This was my first encounter also with this author and it will be the last.I have to agree with the Publishers Weekly Review that it contains ""overwrought dream sequences and one dimensional characters"". I was hoping for historical fiction along the lines of The Popes Daughter and Death of a Medici Princess by Caroline Murphy. This book was more like a Danielle Steel fantasy."
1,this book is full of lies,"i have read this book , i was shocked becouse i know the Auther`s brother and family , this kept switching back and forth , first he was a not beliver in GOD at all , then he became a christian , then he switched back to Islam , finally he became a christian ,,, so i think this guy is looking for mony and how to be famouse ."
1,Major dissapointment,"First, it is only minimally compatible with my Proscan television, which is a product of the same corporate entity (Thomson). You would think that they would want it to work well with their own products!Secondly, there were no codes in it for my Apex AD-600A DVD player or my Memorex VCR. These aren't antiques, nor are the too new to be known by this remote. I went through the entire code search process, trying every code for both devices.Thirdly, when we finally started using it for TV only (when the original remote wore out), it was incredibly flaky, and had to be whacked firmly several times a day. Very unreliable battery contacts!Completely unsatisfactory!I gave up and bought a Philips/Magnavox PM625. Controls everything I have. Easy to set up. It can even do learning if there's no matching code. All for a couple of dollars more."
1,Poorly compiled.,"That's it. Don't bother. The big print in the book garners it the one-star review, otherwise I would have given it none."
1,Too small,"This purchase was a big disapoitment for me...the bag is too small, dont be fooled by the picture. I thought the bag would be at least twice the size of the one I got."
1,Lame and embarassing,Well I am a bit jaded because I live in a city where everybody talks and looks like Larry The Cable guy. If the people here don't resemble him then they resemble Ned Flanders from The Simpsons. So I get to put up with both extremes in real life. Why would anybody want to pay for this load of nonsense unless you are from a real sophisticated state or city and this to you is hilarious because you are laughing at how lame this obese comedian is. The blue collar TV show was mildly funny. This CD on the other hand is not funny. It isn't even crude or offensive. This humor is childish and bad and possibly young kids would think it was funny for a week but most adults wouldn't buy into this stuff for a minute.
1,Buy more than one. Just in case.,"Bulb maybe got damaged during shipping, but it crumbled to pieces in my hands when I tried to put it into a lamp. Good thing I bought two and was extremely careful with second one."
1,"Save your money, to buy something better.","I bought mine over the internet, and just tried it out. There is definitely not enough suction power, and after a few minutes air was back in the bag. This is absolutely useless! I wonder, really, why companies bother to produce something that simply does not work. You get what you pay for alright. If you must save longer to buy a better brand, it will certainly be worth it. Otherwise, good quality ziplock bags and a rolling pin are much cheaper."
1,"Great series, Bad DVD.","Even though I am a big fan of the series I was not happy when I got the DVD set for season 1, they say it has all of the season 1 episodes on it, but it does not have the never aired ""Terms of Endearment"" episode on it (even though it does have some questions from that episode on the ""Censored/Uncensored"" Game). And you only get two episodes on Disc #2 in this set."
1,Should be called Corrupt and DisHonerable.....,"I really hate the series. All the wooden acting, the lack of humanity, and the tasteless jokes. This is not a series, this is the present day version of the Roman Gladiator Games."
1,Doesn't work,This battery did not work with the Nikon D90. I wish I hadn't been so cheap and bought the Nikon battery.
1,Horrible CD!,"This album offers nothing more than the bad performances that Fantasia showed on American Idol. Her voice is as annoying as ever - very squeaky as if she's not singing. The style is no better. The constant hange in lyrics to yeah, yeah, yeahs is absolutely shows absolutely no class and no espect for the composers of the songs.This is the worst AI CD I've ever purchased. While I don't agree with the personal attacks made on her on this site, I'm not surprised that the one-star reviews are overwhelming.Those who don't like her CD have as much right to say their piece as those who like it. If Fantasia's fans can't take the criticisms being made on their idol, they shouldn't put her in such a high-profile position."
1,Boring!,Beginning started out fine and then I kept waiting for the plot to thicken. Never happened. At times I felt like throwing it off to the side and starting a new book but thought it has to get more interesting. Never happened. The title does not fit the book. There was no real sense of revenge. Very disappointed. I certainly do not plan on loaning this book out to any friends.
1,Does not work,Unfortunately this product does not work. I have tried it in numerous locations and the cat(s) just blatantly ignore it. I am very disappointed in this product.
1,Are minus stars available for a review?,"The author of The Rift is very well read but extreemly poorly written. This book should not belong to the End of the World fiction genre, and any comparisons to the likes of Earth Abides, Survivors, or A Wrinkle in the Skin would be shameful. If anyone gives this book a good review, may I suggest they read better books with which to make comparisons."
1,Battery Mount does not Fix Vista HCx,The battery mount does not fit the Vista HCx because of the micro SD mount. The description is misleading because is lists model as being compatible. Many people have noted this in comments and the description should be rewritten.
1,should have a better choice,"Poor choice and quality of photos (news photos taken from appearance in functions), disappointing for fans. Wish Amazon(US)had a better choice on offer."
1,Total Loss,"Very disappointed in this product. The earphones are large and don't stay in the ears. The vertical support is flimsy so offers no structure to keep in the ear, wore it once and now it is trash. NO!"
1,better books for sleep,"I got this book because I thought this was the title of a recommended book, I read about half and it didn't really help with what I need right now. My baby is 7 weeks and I needed something that would help now; this book is more geared towards toddlers and up.I would recommend Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child. It is a great book and also recommended to me by several people. It speaks specifically to the age of your child starting from newborn."
1,Not that fun,I bought this for a 9yr old boy thinking it would be fun due to all the positive reviews. It was the most boring magic set I've ever seen. The tricks are silly. I think he played with it out of obligation but has never touched it again. Melissa and Doug usually make great toys but I think maybe they should stick to entertaining the smaller children.
1,Why would you buy this book?,"Even though I had this book given to me, I still couldn't justify what I spent on it (a little time). Maltin has to be the worst, in what is clearly marginally useful profession. I mean, if you're reading this, you can simply go on the internet and find all sorts of better, more custom suited, reviews and suggestions. Give this one a pass."
1,Nothing new here,So predictable in the first few minutes that I couldn't watch all of it. Nothing new or exciting here. Movies like this are a dime a dozen.
1,"Two books in one - one good, the other VERY bad","I liked the plot but disliked the horrible pulp PI story, with big breasted girls and macho guy. Despite what the author affirms, Joe is a RAMBO character. The conspiration plot was wonderfull, and I'm starting to think that the movie Wag the Dog took the best part of the book"
1,THE SOUND OF BEING PAID,"There is very little innovative about Third Eye Blind . Although I bought into their catchy song ""Semi-Charmed Life"" off their first album , I later found Third Eye Blind an easily forgetable band . With their new album album ""Blue"", they deliver corporate rock at it's finest . Along with their brethren Tonic and Matchbox 20 , they produce catchy , yet meaningless songs for the listener who does not expect much from the music they listen to . Alot of people enjoy music like this . But for the serious music fan , Third Eye Blind is mindless drivel ."
1,useless.,"It's good only if you need to memorize words, one-liner questions and sentences from English to Azeri. You will be taught how to ask questions in Azeri, that's all. For the answer to that, you're on your own. The CD is PC-based and too much attention was given to the graphical user interface rather than the content."
1,Died after 5 weeks,"Worked great for 5 weeks then the screen went black. Tried a reset, but could not transfer pictures to the frame, so then I tried a compact flash card. It worked for 10 minutes then the pictures went away and the frame started rapid cycling (uncommanded) through some of the menu screens. Then, it died again, black screen, won't turn on or off, the power button lights but that's all. Called Philips, they were very nice and they are sending me a new one but it looks like, they have some problems or a bad batch of units. I paid extra for the Philips name, hope they come through with a good one.UPDATE: The replacement unit, which was remanufactured here in the US has been great. It's almost a year old now. No problems at all."
1,Title misleading,"This battery was not in ""Original Motorola Retail Package"" as stated. Simply it came in a little plastic covering, leading me to wonder how reliable the battery really is. We'll have to see, but i have my doubts."
1,Not what I expected,The box and the lid do not fit snuggly and it is a lot smaller than I expected it to be.
1,Not for me.....,"Not for me.....Lilyette Women's Maximum Support Bra, Fawn.....Unattractive and shaped funny nice color but uncomfortable.....I just threw them out....not worth returning!~"
1,Just OK,Does the job for my wife with some modifications. As designed it will not stay put on the floor. I bought a piece of capet mesh to put under the cycle to keep it from moving. Also when you increase the resistance it makes pedeling an uneven jerky type of motion. Overall it will help her until the weather gets good enough to walk outside.
1,I'M A REBEL,"Of the 16 tracks, 14 sound about the same to my untrained ear. If you like someone who screams unintelligible lyrics, except for the frequent F-U that you can make out...this is your album. I found it difficult to dance to without breaking something...like my hip. There are better hardcore/punkish tunes out there. Don't pay more than $2.00."
1,flawed product,"big scooby doo fan, love all these episodes but one of the discs in the pack that i got was flawed and wont play on most dvd players, looks like it was burned wrong or something."
1,A Different Opinion,"I'm a really big Lifehouse fan, but I don't see how this album deserves all the 5 star ratings. It's got a couple of good songs, but the rest are pretty boring. If you like slow, meandering songs then this album is quite nice. Don't listen to it while driving, you might fall asleep."
1,Cute mouse but stopped working 2 years later,"The Logitech V200 is a decent mouse. The receiver attaches to the back of the mouse (which is average -- most new mice have the USB receiver slide into a compartment within the mouse itself). The battery life is good and the cherry red color is quite unique. However, the mouse itself has stopped working after 2 years later (bought in late December of 2006).Logitech has personally stopped manufacturing this mouse. I called Logitech, got a customer service rep right away, and after some testing with the rep, she just got my information to send a new mouse (the next model closest to the V200 is the V220). It was a really easy process and surprised as well since I heard reports that Logitech's customer service was quite horrible. But with the economy these days, everyone is boosting their service to retain customers.Decent mouse but failed to work suddenly after 2 years. Logitech service was outstanding.Get the V220 or higher."
1,Don't waste your money,"I too thought they would taste good. They are, to put it as politely as I can, disgusting. It took everything I had to finish just one!"
1,"Very flimsy, poor design.","I have a Top Flite 20-ft telescoping flagpole that I've had for close to two years. I've had problems with most everything, the spring loaded pins that hold each section extended, and the clear plastic collars that sit atop each section. The spring loaded pins that freeze from retracting, or will not extend; these have contributed to numerous uncommanded collapses of one or two sections causing damage to the pin mechanism and elongating the holes that the pins extend through. The clear plastic collars have set pins that you tighten with an Allen wrench. The plastic is so fragile that it is next to impossible to avoid breaking them. I've gotten my flagpole back up, but I had to improvise. I bought 3 hose clamps from the hardware store and installed them just above the plastic collars. Think seriously, with the constant failures and maintenance, I would never buy one of these again."
1,"""Recordable Media"" Close to Bootleg","A good series being ruined by more greed. They've come to realize that, since fans are desperate to see this stuff, they can get away with highway robbery with dvd-r. Hanna Barbera is doing the same thing with ""Josie And The Pussycats In Outer Space"", among many others. I've drawn the line. For me, packaging is part of the allure of getting a set. Discs with colored art work are a sign that money has been invested. That, along with professional packaging, are what makes me want to get an entire series. I am a collector and I only want the best. Obviously, the shows themselves are what I'm after, but why should I have a negative feeling when I pay good money? All I can think of is , ""this stuff is a bootleg""!"
1,As depressing as her story,"It helps to realize that this author wrote another book a few years later More, Now, Again: A Memoir of Addiction and that she became an addict after her anti-depressant failed to help her.Although I can appreciate the literary style of evoking the same emotions in your reader as the story itself conveys rather than shedding light on the real pain of depression this book feels like the emotional outbursts of someone living with a borderline personality disorder instead. BPD is equally painful and treatable via intensive therapy (or in many cases treating the underlying trauma) this book seems to lack the same inner connection to self and emotional abandonment she suffers from and lacks any empathetic connection to her readers."
1,When Pigs Fly,"I had difficulty playing this DVD. I tried it in two DVD players, a PC and a MacBook Pro. Finally was able to play it in the MacBook. In DVD players, the opening screen just looped, and I wasn't able to break out of the loop. When I finally got it to play, the video quality was poor. The film covered two events: a tornado and a flood."
1,Way too basic,I was disapointed that this book was so basic. It had a lot of potential but was a real dud. I'm sure there are others out there that are more useful.
1,One of the most awful books I've ever read...,"For a number of years I kept hearing what a classic work of American literature Ayn Rand's ""Atlas Shrugged"" was. Despite repeated attempts to read this huge, awkward book I could never get beyond the first 50 or so pages. Finally at 28 years old I forced myself to read the entire thing. Classic work of American literature? Hardly. What a long-winded, confused and throughly terrible piece of tripe filled with characters you couldn't care less about, all of whom are totally devoid of normal human emotion, and ridiculous situations that were obviously contrived simply to prove a point or make some grand 'statement'. Rand could have written this book with one sentence ""Capitalism good, communism bad"" and saved me a long, mind-numbingly dull read"
1,Difficult to Install--Poorly Designed Light Kit,"The fan, particularly the light kit, is difficult to install. Now that it is installed (five months ago) the housing holding the globe/shade just fell off of the fan the first hot day of summer. In examining the light kit, it is obvious to me that it is was not designed/built for outdoor use because it does not provide adequate strength and play for expansion/contraction. I am surprised since it is an outdoor fan with a wet rating. Furthermore, good luck with even finding out how to order a replacement globe from Hunter.The fan looks great, but don't count on it lasting or being easy to fix if you have a problem."
1,Bummer,Appendix A is pretty worthless helping you set up the SDK developement kit. I don't understand why it was not included in the CD-ROM. Be prepaired to sit and wait while you have to download tools in order to use this book. I went through set up 5 times and it still doesn't work. Title should be JAVA 2 SCRATCHING YOUR HEAD TYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO SET THIS UP. I am very disapointed because the exercises seem very interesting. Phone support would have been helpful.
1,Not the perfect choice.,"I bought this item few days ago. I didn't like it because I wanna learn Chinese (obviously), but I can Not learn it without listening to the pronunciation of the words... It is sooo annoying. big dislike:("
1,Not a GUIDE,This is not a cook book. I got a divorce after applying several of this book's principals and ideals. Couldn't master love.
1,Wrong book,"For some weird reason, instead of Algebra by P. M. Cohn (a very good graduate text on abstract algebra) I get some Middle school book on algebra by Dolciani, Wooton, and Beckenbach... Mistery...."
1,Relora - Rip off~ Does not work!,"My fault on this one, just go to the first reviews written it says it does not work. To all you fake people giving false reviews F@#$ you! And shame on you amazon for allowing this the same reviews are used everywhere and are probably written by the same company that sells them. Save your money, it does not work! Took the whole bottle all 3 at once and at separate times no difference what so ever! Throw you money out the window better at least you will make someones day not support these crooks!"
1,Almost his worst film,"It wasn't the worst, but it was close. The story line is creative, but drags constantly. If you are bored and want a movie that will SLIGHTLY entertain you.....this is it. It seems as if Hollywood doesn't have many good films to produce this year. Harrison Ford is a great actor, but this film doesn't help his career at all!"
1,Dull movie,"As our kids are fans of great mouse movies like Flushed Away, I thought they would like The Tale of Despereaux. The kids, my husband and I were all bored, bored, bored and we couldn't even watch to the end. Don't waste your time on this one."
1,A Little Disappointed,"I was a little disappointed that the book did not elaborate a little more on the specific cases cited as examples. Most of the time it just indicates if a particular case either set a precedent or was a counter-example to a precendent, and then gives a footnote reference to legal documents. The book reads too much like a synopsis of a legal library. When statistics is discussed, it is an elementary exposition of basic concepts. What I wanted was lucid examples of how these basic concepts actually made a difference in legal cases. I did not get that from this book. This was the first book on statistics and law that I bought and read, so I don't know how to compare it to others. But I will select and try another to see if what I am looking for is out there."
1,Loving What Is,"My shrink suggested I read this book so I bought it and tried to read it. I've only been able to get through a quarter of the book so far because the main message seems to be: ""It's not what happened to you, it's how you look at what happened, so forgive the person who hurt you and let it go.""I guess that's a nice idea but I don't think that works under all circumstanaces. I mean if somebody hurt you very badly, it may be nice to forgive them but I'm not sure that helps to keep it from happening again.I would like to make sure I take better care of myself by keeping it from happening again and just looking at something differently doesn't really seem to do that. I've forgiven myself for letting it happen but I want to make sure it doesn't happen again. How does looking at something differently do that?"
1,Absolutely HORRIBLE,I have used electric skillets for years and years. I was so excited to get this new one because I thought the removeable pan would be a huge plus. That idea was a huge plus BUT the pan itself was absolutely awful. Everything and I mean everything sticks to this surface. You can actually see while scrubbing lightly that the coating just comes right off. Although that being said...it's no great loss because it didn't work anyways. I definitely would NOT recommend this!!!
1,Shiny with no substance,"If gaming graphic is what you looking, fifa 07 on the xbox 360 is the game for you. The game look great, the player model are simply unbelievable but once you pass graphic there nothing there. The gameplay is horrific, commentary should have been left out. The game is very dull,I tried playing on XBL but it didn't help, there was no excitement playing this game at all just frustration. I got so frustrated playing this game that I almost broke my wireless controller. I am so glad that I rented this game before I actuallybrought it. If just want to stare at the player model definitely buy this butif you actually want to play it and have fun doing so try something else."
1,PRODUCT NOT PROPERLY DESCRIBED,"I am sure that the product is a ""good"" product and very well made, but the full description of the product was not conveyed properly in the ad. In the picture of the product, it appears to be a full size comfort bicycle seat, but when received, it is more like a racing bike seat, and not very comfortable.I returned the product for credit, and apprecited the way the credit was handled and expedited.Will certainly make other purchases via Amazon.com"
1,Frustrated with poorly-fitting pieces,"The piece shapes are loose-fitting and don't make sure matches. I gave up when I had only the snowy tree limbs left. I couldn't find anything reliable to build on and was not enjoying myself. If ""Bird Watchers"" was my first ever puzzle I'd probably never want to try another one, but I'm a puzzle-lover from way back."
1,...,"YES! At last, a phenomenal movie on the great Irish hero! What a shame historical accuracy played little or no part in the portrayal of his British opponents. Seens of Anglo-Saxon butchery and the torture of an IRA terrorist who actually died of old age dozens of years later add this film to a long line of quasi-historical anti-English bunkum Hollywood has churned out in recent years... Braveheart, Titanic, The Patriot etc etc."
1,"Nice variety of sizes, but the labels wear away","I've had these measuring spoons for a couple of years now. The size labels have worn away on the spoons used most often. At first I thought it was because I put them in the dishwasher. However, another has disappeared even though I'm now washing them by hand. The spoons are also rather wide, making them difficult to fit into spice jars. Overall, I'm disappointed in the set."
1,Buyer Beware,"Beware, this is NOT Battlestar Galactica but some stupid pilot for a show I will never watch."
1,Pavarotti and Freni pretending to be bohemians,"One thing I find dissapointing in many Pavarotti opera productions is that everything seems to be adapted for Pavarotti instead of Pavarotti being adapted for the plot (or the music). Everyone knows who is the star, there is no Rodolfo in Paris having a romance with a ill-fated girl; it's just Pavarotti with a wig pretending he is still able to sing a good Rodolfo and some other singers trying not to distract us. Excellent Freni does awful singing in this production and her overacting ruins her singing many times."
1,A good story badly told,"Readers hoping for a good read about Lawrence will be sadly disappointed.This is an interesting story badly told. Mr Asher keeps interrupting his narrative by persistent psychoanalysis of Lawrence as well as stories of his own exploits in the footsteps of his subject. Such comments rightfully belong in the footnotes and appendixes. Putting them in the main body makes this a cumbersome work.The book should be more aptly titled Psychoanalysing Lawrence. Then at least the reader will know what he is in for. For those who just want a good read of Lawrence of Arabia, warts and all, this is not the book."
1,Book rated PG-13,The version of this classic story is not appropriate for toddlers. I agree with the 1star reviews. It's a version that I find cruel and cold.
1,"Basic, Basic",For a 4 set DVD you would think that the programs would lead up to building a better and repeatable swing. I have a copy of Leadbetter's single DVD which covers everything the $100 dollar 4 set does. It started with the basic's and never took it up a notch. Jim MaCleans 8 step swing is a way better product.
1,DELIVERED A DIFFERENT VERSION = NO SPECIAL PACKAGING,"i was most let down upon recieving the dvd, as it wasnt the i pictured...i got just the 2 disc version, no special edition packaging and no extra gifts = matches..this was a major let down to me ,as im a dvd collector..from now on i will e-mail amazon before ordering to agree it is the item pictured."
1,"Is not 100 IU as described, is marked 200 IU on bottle",The title says it all. These are soft capsules so it's a mess having to break them open to get 100 IU which is my dog's dosage.
1,Not very secure,"Since these don't have unique keys (each set is the same), anyone could buy a set a of these and use them to take off your wheels. Various bike mechanics I've spoken to didn't recommend them for that reason."
1,don't work,my game dosn't workk... its the second time i bought this game w a diferent seller.. my kid love power rangers !!!. so i get him a gamecube power rangers disc for his wii..
1,lies lies lies,"This book was not in the condition listed. In fact, it's practically falling apart. I also found it quite tacky they left a $0.50 sticker on it. I got ripped off but that won't happen again. I will never buy from this seller again!"
1,Doomsday (the day you watch this movie),"This is just a terrible letdown of a movie. We watched it after learning it was the director's follow up to The Descent, but were very disappointed. Plot is frustratingly non-existent and there isn't enough style to carry your attention through.Also, the obligatory car chase scene is the worst sports car commercial ever. Whoever licensed their car to this movie should have to explain to it's shareholders why their insanely good looking sports car can't outrun broken down post-apocalyptic rust bucket trucks and buses at speeds approaching an apparent 40 MPH!!! In this entire post-apocalyptic Scottish cannibal deadly virus movie, the car chase was the still the most unbelievable part. Unbelievably poor film-making."
1,Tedious,"I bought the game because it had very good hype. But I've learned since then that you should never believe in it. This game ranks in my top five of having a great story. The only problem is that the game advances really slowly. The battles take too long, and even if you have a great character you can't avoid the non-random, almost same monster. Tediousness sets in when you have to backtrack several times without advnacing in the story. Monsters always reapear and they are always the same. Graphics are good, in pseudo-3D. Sound is repetitive. And the magic system, needs some work. Bad graphical effects and almost no benefit for using your precious ""mana"" points."
1,Baaaaad service,"I ordered a size 10 and got a size 10.5. I asked the supplier to cover the cost of return since I live overseas. They never replied to me. Thus, I am now left with a product which does not fit me and which I can not return. Simply overall bad service."
1,This is NOT Bellodgia,"I agree with the most recent two reviewers: this is a not a pleasant fragrance, and it most definitely is NOT Bellodgia. Bellodgia has been my only fragrance for more than 30 years, even though I used to have to go to great lengths to find it. I've had good luck ordering it from Amazon in recent years, and have been grateful for that convenience. But this last order... This stuff has a harsh and acrid scent. The packaging looks right--but it's clearly a BAD knockoff."
1,WHAT THE F*********K!,"THIS IS PURE S##T. THE ONLY GOOD SONG ON THIS CD IS ""UNTIL IT SLEEPS"" THE ONLY GOOD SONG. THE REST IS PURE CRAP. SAVE YOUR MONEY FOR BETTER METALLICA. PASS LOAD AND RELOAD. ITS NOT WORTH ONE F**KING CENT."
1,think twice,"Hi, just got this as a present and after 2 days of frustration its going back .. poor quality through-out .... hard to use .. and don't get me started on the instructions ...I'd say to ... - STOP selling it!"
1,a very very bad product from Magellan,"As a matter of fact, maps are almost all inaccurate, from 100 to about 1000 feet. Also, the software itself is outdated. It looks like a Windows 95 software. Regarless how many times people positively reviewed it, Mapsend is unarguably not as good as the Magellan GPS units: I personally purchased the Meridian platinum. But what is the purpose of having a good GPS if the software does not compute routes accordingly?In addition, uploading maps into the unit is not as easy as I would have expected.Of course, this software will never compete with an expensive OEM Car Navigation System (Navtech is producing all the maps for almost all car navigation system, Magellan is not using Navtech maps) The first purpose of the handheld GPS is outdoor, not driving. But for the most part, hiking trails are omitted, this is the biggest shortcoming. What does Magellan believe an outdoor GPS is made for? back and forth?DON'T BOTHER"
1,"Bad, really bad","Forget the plot. I won't bore you with it. It tries to be all things to all men and ends up being nothing. The protaganist's worry about the baby birds from the nests she is photographing is ludricrous. Yes, have some sympathy but don't go around telling the whole world. NOBODY CARES. The romance is shallow and Ms. Ennis never makes it or the characters believable. None of the characters are believable. It really has the feeling of being slapped together in a very short time. Don't waste your money on this one. Hot romantic scenes cannot make up for the disconnected nature of this book."
1,Bad Batteries & Phone,"Maybe it was just the phone I bought b/c I haven't seen any other similar reviews....but I thought I loved this phone at first and then after about 1 month the screen on the handset kept saying ""Warning - Use rechargeable batteries only"" The only batteries that I ever used in it were the rechargeable ones that came in the box with the phone. Now the phone works for about 2 minutes and then I have to keep it on the charger all the time!"
1,Plastic teeth shedded on base and jar,"We bought this at Sears and used this blender about ten times; the gears ground themselves to bits, under a load of ice cream and milk, about half full. Pathetic. The gear on the base and also on the jar were completely ruined. Sears was great about taking it back, I just feel bad for whoever buys this thing after its refurbished."
1,Ever more bitter and cynical,"It's painful to watch Sodd Runtlestuntle slide. If you're looking for a fix of what made you love Plodd in the first place, you're not going to find it here. What we have here is a bitter man trying desperately to look hip, grudgingly tossing his fan base a bone with a lame remake of one of his worst songs. I prefer the idealistic Godd Runtgreen of the 70s - at least he seemed to care about humanity, and he made me want to ""join him inside his dream""."
1,A scoundrel by any name,I always like Michael Douglas--he's interesting and watchable no matter what the material. But I couldn't like him in this movie--he has no redeeming qualities and it is hard to root for him. He self-destructs and keeps himself from getting what desires. I should feel sorry for him but didn't.
1,Funny once,I saw this toy on a show and it didn't have the sounds from it. This thing is funny but so loud. You can't leave it plugged in for more than a second because of the sound.
1,this is for 12-15 year old fags that dont know real music..,this is not metal.. this is faggot as- nu-metal crap. this band is horrible its just mainstream mall metal garbage. [...] go pick up a black dalia murder or canibal corpse cd if you want real heavy stuff. this couldn't compare to slayer or any other real metal band. peace mall metal losers.
1,Doesn't Drain!,"Definitely not a good purchase. The drainer doesn't drain very well, if at all. Right now, I have the back propped up about an inch so the drainer actually drains. Otherwise, water just sits on it until you manually lift the back up to drain off the water. This is definitely not the same quality as a Rubbermaid drainer I purchased about 2-3 years ago. The plastic is much thinner and not very pliable. Als,o the country where it was manufactured (good ole USA) isn't where it is manufactured now (China). I'm debating on whether or not to return it with the dish drainer portion also. Buyer beware of this one! Shame on Rubbermaid for manufacturing an inferior product."
1,Who dun such awful writing?,"I picked this book up at a bookstore and clearly didn't make a wise purchase. For those of you who really like mystery and suspense, DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK! The writing is terrible and if you really like mystery and suspense, these are not the authors for you. Although I should qualify that and state that after the first two stories, I did not read the last two because I was sure they were probably the same style as the first two. The stories have no real plot other than ""tired and bored city girl meets hunk and has sex with him."" In fact the first two stories are so short on plot, suspense and writing ability that you could swear they were written by the same hand. Even the author's beloved sex scenes are poorly done and sound like the ramblings of an adolescent.Do yourself a favor and don't buy this book. It is awful! The only mystery contained within these pages is how and why they were actually published."
1,It Did Not Steal My Heart,I must admit that I was let down after reading all of the other raving reviews.The book was difficult or a bit rough to read. In several areas there were typos or just no direction and as a result I had a hard time determining whether it was a narration or a character speaking. Plus there were a couple of areas that just did not flow real well. It was like the author was jumping around or lost focus about what she was writting about. The plot was good and had great potential and there was a deal of suspense but unfortunatly the hard spots made it difficult to follow. If you are willing to overlook these items then by all means purchase the book. This author has potential and I hope that she lives up to this potential in the following books.
1,Social Handbook,"If one is to believe what he has written, he is certainly a world class ""freeloader.&quot"
1,the nadir of this company's products,"Ugh! I sure had high hopes and I was bitterly disappointed. These things were just nasty. I LOVE their other products (""just the cheese"") but not these things.I even heated them up as suggested but they didn't get better."
1,"Good photos, awful printing","I had heard of Frans Lanting as an outstanding wildlife photographer and jumped at the chance to buy one of his books for a reasonable price. I would have expected maybe $40-$60 for a good coffee table book, and now that I've received the book I know why it was only $13: the print quality is just awful. Resolution is poor -- every photo looks blurred; there is not a sharp contour in any photo (seriously). Many photos have a reddish color cast. None of the images pop out of the page. Most are dark and have no detail in the shadows. Bottom line, every photo is dull and nearly lifeless, even though the subjects are anything but. I am sure this is not how they started out from Lanting's shots. As an amateur photographer who has spent considerable effort calibrating my workflow for color reproduction, I recognize many of these problems as basic issues that any decent photographic-oriented printer should have solved long ago. But maybe that is the reason the book is $13."
1,Short Battery life,"The mouse itself works fine and I don't have problems with range as I had with my last cordless mouse. However the battery will last only one or two days. Logitech states that 8 hioours of use is the expected life. It's easy enough to swap the batteries back and forth, but still a small hassle. Most people should opt for a less power hungry mouse."
1,"Terrible Movie, but hey, Paula Abdul's in it!","I have always heard nothing but terrible reviews of this movie, so when I decided to finally see for myself (and this was solely because I am a Paula fan and wanted to see her...*bad acting*) it was worse than expected. The film lagged and reminded me of Paula's last venture in acting. ""touched by evil"" anyone (one of ABC's worst made for TV movies in history).Bottem line: Not worth your precious time (unless you like Paula!)."
1,Don't Buy It if You Want to Sharpen A Quality Knife,The sticks are not for sharpening a quality steel knife from Germany or Japan. The storage box is made from low quality wood full of knots and looks real ugly even though the picture of the box shown by Amazon is very nice.
1,Works but fragile,"I bought this accessory about 5 years ago to connect my TiVO to a wired internet connection. It was the only such adapter available at BestBuy when I bought it. It worked well but the design is poor in that it does not keep a reliable connection and once the door breaks off (which eventually will happen, it is not very rugged), no amount of duct tape will salvage it.I am trying a D-Link adapter next - hopefully with more reliable results.01/07/2010 UPDATE: I have been using my D-Link adapter for several months now and it works like a champ and is much better quality."
1,Very disappointing,"I was very disappointed in this book. The plot was great and could have made for a great book, but the language was profane, inappropriate, and made me very uncomfortable. An 11-year old girl in Utah in the late 1800's would never use that kind of language even when trying to shock her family! It was a very inaccurate portrayal of the time period. The author ruined what could have been a good novel. Definetely NOT a great book for teens!"
1,never got it~,"Never received my order from Old Glory via Amazon, which included this hat and a t-shirt. Amazon did make sure my money was reimbursed, I never got a response from Old Glory even after sending two emails. I do thank Amazon for resolving this issue but am hesitant to shop this way again."
1,Like a soap opera...,"Like a soap opera, I was able to skip about every 5 pages and still hang onto the plot...such as it is. Luckily, I borrowed the book. Didn't waste the money. I'll buy the last book in the series because I expect it'll be even better than the first few."
1,Not at all as pictured.,"I ordered the brown color expecting a light brown leather sandal. I received a mud brown, almost maroon swede sandal that looked awful. The tag matched the style and color here, so I am not sure what the deal is."
1,Not as expected,"Contrary to that suggested, if not indicated, this SNAA03 is not a titanium case or band watch. The finish apparently has titanium in it but this is a heavy case and band watch stated by Seiko and the case to be steel."
1,Not The Best,"I used to like Hilary Duff. Then, I heard Kelly Clarkson and found out what real singing is. My brother, still thinkin i liked Hilary, bought the second cd for me. I listened to it, because i was curious. Her voice isnt Horrible. it doesnt sound like a dying cow. But its not very good. The lyrics are kind of strange, but whatever floats your boat i guess. Save your money and buy 'Breakaway' by Kelly Clarkson."
1,A piece of junk,"I find it hard to believe that this is a genuine Garmin part. I have an original Garmin suction cup mount with the clip-on bracket and that one works very well. The finish on the one shipped by Amazon.com is so poor that it is very hard to connect the bracket to the mount. The finish on the inside of the hole in the bracket that slips over the ball on the mount is terrible. Either Garmin quality has dropped considerably, or Amazon.com has mislabeled a low quality third-party substitute as a genuine Garmin product."
1,Stop Me Before I Throw It Through The Window,"Very frustrating to use. Doesn't like to connect to the computer on the first try. The software that allows you to operate it via the computer won't always launch. The unit sometimes has a hiccup and won't respond to a touch command, so when it wakes up after the second or third try, it does the command...you got it, three times. I bought it for the larger screen. But overall, it has not been an enjoyable thing to use. UPDATE: I gave up and threw it out. By this time, I didn't want to exchange it for the second time. I'm washing my hands of TomTom."
1,"Short, simple, & awkward perversion flick","Not much depth to this movie, it stretches disbelief a bit too far without at least showing that these characters could be either that dumb, selfish or submissive. It leaves you feeling like a perverted sucker, spending $4 to watch this cute young girl get naked."
1,terrible,"no deberian ofrecer productos que ya no se usan tecnologicamente hablando y que pueden causar confusion, lo compre pensando que eran GB (no MB). Terribleterribleshould not offer products that are no longer used technologically speaking and that can cause confusion, buy it thinking they were GB (not MB). terrible"
1,"Annoying, At Best....","Oh my....this was a disappointing read! The main character, Rebecca, is so shallow and clueless that I wanted her to suffer bankruptcy and to be thrown into prison. Her answer to her obsession with shopping and overspending is to get a job in a retail store on the weekends....hello?!?! I bet you can't guess what happens next, right? Although she can't bear to open her late payment notices, she becomes a financial wiz on a local television news show....and gets the guy....PLEASE!!!!The end of this book was also predictable, but was the only thing that justified my reading it. Don't waste your money on this one!!"
1,Worst Phone Yet!,"This phone is great for the speaker, but I would not recommend this phone for the hearing impaired. Both my husband and I agree, it's like talking to someone standing in the middle lane of a highway. The back ground noise make it very hard to hear the person on the other end. Everyone sounds like they have a cold. Just by looking at the phone, you can tell it takes up to much room."
1,Good Idea: Bad Technology,"We bought the phone six months ago, and have experienced the problems of clicking, hiss, and poor volume control described by others."
1,Awful,"These wipes are terrible. They are tiny and thin. I have to use 3X as many as with other wipes. How green is that? Also, they smell AWFUL. Do not buy these."
1,Worst Clancy ever?,"This was absolutely horrible. I read it all the way through, hoping it would get better but it never did. Predictable, dull, uninspired -- and I usually like his books. And, come on, did someone at Starbucks pay him for a product placement? Skip this one, there are many better ones out there."
1,He returned it after using it a few times.,Couldn't get a close shave without going over the same area 10 times or more. Very disappointed after the adds on TV made it look ao good.
1,Exceedingly partial report on the Mossadeq era,"Kinzer is a journalist in the worst sense of the word: unfortunately, his report is exceedingly one-sided as he relies only on the reports of one or two instensely pro-Mossadeq scholars, completely ignoring other sources and especially Royalist people, some of whom are still alive and could have been reached for comment. Kinzer doesnt even speak Farsi (Persian), and thus did not have any access to authentic Iranian sources, except through his two pro-Mossadeq helpers.This book is actually a tragedy, as the material is very sensetive and it being treated in such a frivolous manner is rather insulting.I would wholeheartedly recommend James Bill's ""The Eagle and the Lion"" instead of this book."
1,JUST PLAIN BAD,"this was one of the worst games that i have ever played in my life. for starters, it has that horrible swerve camera that if you stare at it enough, it makes you want to throw up(nautious).the gameplay is also just plain stupid. i mean cmon....why are bart and his sister driving cars??? another thing is that it gets boring wayyyyy to quickly. how many times can you do the same boring mission over and over without wanting to smash your TV?! i would reccomend somebody to NEVER BUY THIS AND NEVER RENT THIS GAME!!"
1,Incomplete,"I've learned nothing from the book. The book I paid $150 for ($100 after my scholarship). The examples skip most of the steps. This is fine for someone who can infer the steps with ease, but leaves someone who can't completely bewildered.I have had to use videos on Youtube and a few websites to piece together an understanding of the material, along with some help from my instructor when I could understand the problem well enough to explain to him what I didn't get.Even worse, many concepts (especially problem solving with algebra) are lightly touched with one or two incomplete examples at the end of the section and nothing else.The online component is no better. Pearson has no excuse to omit steps in examples when the explanation for an entire problem would use almost no space, and yet they still do it.The quality of the textbook is absolutely unacceptable."
1,Waste of money,"I am fairly handy in teh kitchen, yet I found this device to be nearly impossible to use. Getting the can started was a chore, and when that was done it didn't always make it all teh way around. Forget this piece of junk."
1,Worst purchase ever,"Nothing about this inverter works as it should, the fan runs constantly if on and it pulls over 20 amps, I could cool the car engine with 20 amps, The unit overheats and shuts off, after 5 minutes, with something as simple as a cellphone charger. And I've tried 3 different cellphones, JUNK"
1,Too loud,"I ordered this chickadee thinking that it would have the ""chicka-dee-dee-dee-dee"" sound. I was disappointed to hear the two two-toned sound only. And it is very loud."
1,The annotated Weston,"There are two principal irritations here--first is the extensive quoting from letters and journals. Easily half the book. They interrupt any flow the book manages. Second is the tone, with the gratuitous generalizations and judgments sprinkled on almost every page, about psychology or about how great an artist Weston was. I have no argument with that, but why the repetition? The tone of the book is odd."
1,AAAAAAHHHHHH!!!!!,"This one makes sense, because the fact that Kidz Bop is in existence is very, very scary.You know someone was gonna say that sooner or later."
1,Terrible Oil ! Don't waste your money !,"I bought this oil and started using it to help grow my hair. I am from India and I know what ""real"" hair oil should be. This is a watered down ""American"" version of a traditional Indian hair oil. The oil should be ""made in India"" to use the correct base oil and herbs. I called the company up and after the representative sound nervous by me asking questions, she told me the oil is made in the USA !! What a joke! If I want something Indian, I want it made in India! Is that asking a lot? I don't want a Toyota car that is ""made in America"". Anyways, sorry for the ranting but the oil doesn't work and is a real ""fake"". Sorry Banyan. I have read good reviews on Vadik Herbs and other brands so I'll check them out and let you all know..."
1,What the hell?¿,"OK, the best song in the movie is when they do that test that says ""NUMBER 1....time is runing out, NUMBER 2....time is running out.."" that is a great song. everyone seems to be having troubles with what the linkin park song is called, this is Figure .o9 found on METEORA. as for the other great songs in the soundtrack, (for instance Crosstown traffic by jimmi Hendrix). if anyone knows the name of the ""time is running out song, PLEASE EMAIL ME!! as for the soundtrack, yea it sucks, dont buy it."
1,Doesn't Fully Charge - A Joke,"After charging overnight and following the instructions the battery is only at 85% charge. What good is this expensive battery if I only get 85% charge. These are a joke and I'm going back to buying regular Duracell Batteries. I bought 16 AA, 8 AAA, and they all come up to about 85% charge. Don't waste your money on this product it's a scam."
1,A complete waste of time and money.,"Absolutely could not get this device to work properly. Halfway through a recording the software froze and forced reboot to recover. Did this on both analog and digital source files. Interesting nowhere in the manual or on the website was there anything about ""trouble shooting"". No weekend support so back it goes."
1,Shame on you Farrel !!!,"The film doesn't bring nothing new about what can happen in the police of any country. Movies are to be enternaiment, they can be violent, sad, happy, scare you ... but an actor and all the people involved that agree in perform a scene like that with the baby ... SHAME ON YOU Farrel !!!"
1,A penny book,"At least you see Bill Clinton's unbroken spine and unread books in the used book stores. Actual people bought them! This worthless waste of toilet paper trash is still sitting on pallets somewhere by the thousands, unread and gathering dust! Bought and paid for by the DNC and the DCCC to help promote their ignorance and hatred for God and America!:)"
1,Very sad and depressing!,"I recently saw A. Manette Ansay on the Oprah Show and was very impressed with her as a person. She captured my attention and her personality was engaging and delightful. Vinegar Hill, like many other of Oprah's recommendations, describes a woman's struggle and the way she deals with her life and inner-self. In Vinegar Hill, the heroine, Ellen, unfortunately doesn't really escape and make her situation better; instead the reader is left asking, ""Why doesn't Elllen react? Do something? Go to her own family for help? "" Rather depressing. The rest of Oprah's books, especially Where the Heart Is and The Book of Ruth also describe a woman and her battles, and in these the woman does triumph and find her seemingly lost spirit. Vinegar Hill is extremely well-written, I just wish the subject were different and characters more likeable."
1,Sorry as erotica it doesn't cut it ...,"So we have a contemporary novel set in a UK seashore resort where a young aspiring actress (and I use the word actress very liberally here) accepts the lead role in a play about sex .....Our heroine, Holly, while asleep, has a pernicious tendency to have erotic dreams, and, while shes awake, well shes pretty much naked, spread eagle for just about everyone. Yup, even the people she hates have total access to her body .....OK.. in my view, erotica has to have some element pursuit, capture and ultimate sweet submission, but, when you are nothing more than a live action porn actress you don't have erotica but rater a very very long Penthouse letter ...."
1,Don't waste your money,"This was on sale at my local high end grocery store so I bought 2 bottles. It's worthless. I might as well run my dishwasher with no detergent whatsoever. I can't count how many times I've had to rewash things by hand after ""washing"" them.I've followed the directions, use the hottest water setting, pre-rinsed, used a vinegar rinse, etc. Nothing will make this stuff work.Save your money and get a different product. You might as well put money in the detergent cup for as effective as this stuff is."
1,Surprised and disappointed,"I found this toy in the end to be very expensive to operate. My son is younger and wanted it running for a couple of hours on Christmas morning and during that time the toy consumed 6 ""C"" cell batteries. The Amazon site does not tell you about the ""C"" cell batteries only the ""AA"" batteries, that is a big slip up. Since Christmas this is about 6 batteries per day! At BJ's those same batteries are about 14.00 per dozen. The locomotive is very detailed and made of plastic, what happens is a young one likes to carry his locomotive around and the plastic bends. I have a choice to make, spend 100.00 on quality rechargable batteries or send this back and buy the 260.00 Polar express ""O"" guage set which is very high quality and metal. In the end I'm disappointed in Amazon for not mentioning the ""C"" batteries and Lionel for not putting a permanent power source on board. I would tell a friend to save their money and buy the ""O"" gauge set over this one."
1,Plantronics Voyager 510,"I had an earlier model of this headset for several years that I would still be using if I hadn't lost it. I tried a Motorola headset next but found that it was uncomfortable to wear for any period of time and I had to turn the volume up to hear. Well, I lost that headset as well. I'm now back to Plantronics and won't leave again. It's comfortable so I sometimes forget that I have it on and the sound quality is great. Just hope I don't lose this one as well.update december 9, 2010. don't let headset completely lose it's charge. if you do, you won't be able a recharge it. plantronics honored the warranty and replaced with a refurb unit. fine, except i misplaced headset in house for a couple of days (yeah, i misplace things a lot. i'm old - go figure.) it lost charge and i had another dead unit. went with a jawbone and no problems since."
1,FIND A LOCAL DISTRIBUTOR,Please guys... I don't recommend you buying the products online from someone you do not know. Please find a Distributor near you... their are millions of them everywhere; like myself. If you have any questions don't hesitate to ask. I'm a certified Herbalife Distributor.
1,Unreliable,"I've have one of the these and another, more expensive, Lexar flash drive just suddenly die on me, and I've read of others who have had the same experience. If you have one already, don't use it as a 'backup' - only use it to transport files."
1,Support bad; no firmware upgrades,"It is not clear if this is a v1 or v2 system. The v1 has not received firmware upgrades for a long time now, altough it is still being sold. Essentially, Linksys has dropped support, concentrating on the newer v2.Here are two things to consider: (1) you don't know whether you will get a v1 or v2, and if you get the old one you are stuck (like me -- and they will not replace for a v2) and (2) if they treat their v1 customers this way, do you think they would do it also to their v2 customers?D-Link has fabulous products, so does Speedstream and SMC and Belkin."
1,Not so good,"The range of reception on this USB 108 wireless adapter is not strong or reliable. I have always had great reception and speed using my Netgear 108 network card, but using the same computer and just changing to the USB adapter I have found that the reception and speed is not even an tenth as good as my original card. I will be returning the item. Unfortunately my PC's standard internal wireless card is better and faster than the Netgear USB.-- Sorry."
1,A Tedious Installment in a Fascinating Series,"The literary problem with this novel, which so many readers find so riveting, is its construction. The book is broken into five parts narrated by four different interconnected persons. While it is interesting to view events as through a prism, this technique wears thin in page after page of rambling prose. This novel would have been much stronger if it had been edited down. Much too much verbiage! Much too much wandering over the same territory! At one point I wondered why I kept plodding on. The answer is, you get hooked on these characters due to this surplice-ripping series as a whole. Despite several melodramatic moments, nothing much happens in this novel-- it could have been condensed into a fine short story. For a budding Howatch fan, I recommend ""Glittering Images"" or particularly the incredible potboiler ""The High Flyer"" over this book any day."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"I fully agree with most other reviewers. The guide for this game has got to be the worst I've ever used. I definitely have the feeling that the publishers rushed through this project. Truly a shame as the game itself is the creepiest of the survival horror genre. There are a number of items the guide misses like extra weapons, alternative areas of exploration and an alternate ending. You'd do better downloading a guide for free from one of the many gaming sites."
1,Disappointed,"I was disappointed with the quality of the pens and ink. The ink runs and the enclosed material was not that good. I also purchased The Complete Caligraphy Set (Readers Digest - Ann Bowen) and all though it uses dip pens, it turns out that they work MUCH better and the material was excellent. For the price, I cannot knock this kit too much, but truthfully, I probably will never use this set. The ink is runny, the nibs are too hard and I just could not control the ink flow. Stick with dip pens and some good bottle ink."
1,impossible to do and could injured yourself,"I bought SO many DVDs to exercise , to loose weight and stay in shape. This one is hard to do (too many hip moves)and most of the move involved only the waist down muscles , no arm or shoulder . after only 5 minutes my knees hurted and the voice of the teacher is SO annoying ! I did not even do the complete DVD once ."
1,To present>,"Title lists as applicable to present- doesn't cover newer mustangs, only 5.0 engines, not 4.6. no help at all."
1,Many good features and many not so good,"Will only mention the features I didn't care for:1) Does not have speed dial. Has directory search which takes longer than keying in the number from a list.2) Message record time is limited to 15 minutes including outgoing msgs which is too short for a 2-line phone used for a small business.3) Listening to msgs doesn't tell you which line the call came in on.4) The base screen is difficult to read if it is not tilted up toward you. Also difficult to read small print of the number of msgs.5) Battery is NicCad, not NicHyd, therefore it holds memory.6) Cannot go back and listen to a portion of a msg, only repeat the entire msg. This is inadequate for long customer orders. It does have ""slow talk"" playback but this is not the solution."
1,DO NOT BUT THIS PRODUCT Under any circumstances!!!!!!,"Bought this item directly from Amazon. It stopped working 1 week after the 30 day return period was up. Only functioned for 5 weeks!! Amazon REFUSED to even exchange it! Said I had to contact the manufacturer.( What a hassle!) I usually love Amazon, but this time I am disgusted with this product. SAVE YOUR MONEY! Do not buy this!Update: Amazon sent a replacement after manufacturer couldn't help.Guess what? It was the same exact product. Right out of the box, it didn't work either!! I bought another cord elsewhere. It works perfectly, so it is not my battery or the computer! Again, DO NOT BUY THIS!!"
1,totally stinks,"this movie is the worst ever! the werewolf looks fake the movie it self makes no sense.If you want good werewolf flicks see american werewolf in london,american werewolf in paris or the old universal movie the wolf man."
1,Color and Human Response,The last chapter of this book is informative and interesting on why people prefer certain colors. The rest of the book deals with metaphysics and psycho-babble.
1,Not Eric Carle's best work,"I love Eric Carle's books, but this one does not measure up to his other works. It introduces an animal eating a food on each day of the week starting with Monday (not Sunday), but there is no plot and is just plain boring. Wish I hadn't spent my money on this one."
1,Find another reel,Definately not worth the price. Does not stop easily when reeling hose out and does not retract well. Feels flimsy.
1,Fake blades!,I have bought these blades many times and normally they are perfect. On the last occasion I purchased these the blades were so bad I couldn't use them because they were so blunt. Be careful which supplier you order this product from as there are definitely fakes being sold.
1,"Best Lip Balm I've Ever Used, Worst Seller","I am a trombone player in college and have been using this for a few months, buying it from the local music store. I love it, as it helps my lips feel better after playing for a while, and it doesn't have any harmful ingredients. I decided to buy several online to save some money in the long run. When I received them, all three were dried up and uncomfortable to use. For the product, 5 stars. For the seller, 0 stars. Next time I'll just buy it in a store."
1,Not what I expected,I would not recommend this shoes. They're uncomfortable and they're really hard that's why I had to return it.
1,4x22mm,"These are not 30mm x 4 times binoculars.There are 30 mm ""window panes"" (nothing optical)in front of the REAL 22mm objectives.These are truly (in reality) 22x4 binoculars with a 5.5mm (measured) exit pupil.The package documentation comes in English, French, Spanish and German.Only the German documentation says ""22x4"" all the others say ""30x4""...my guess is that the German laws are stricter than US, French, Latin countries.These are not unresonable binoculars but they are extremely expensive at THIS price.Save your time and money.I suggest the 6x30mm Leupold BX-1 binoculars...A REAL (30mm x 6 times) with 5mm (measured) exit pupil. I bought them both....I recommend the Leupold...I can not recommend the Bushnell."
1,too saggy,"too saggy for my 14"".will probably fit 17""ersDO NOT BUY IT IF YOUR LAPTOP IS SMALLER THEN 17"""
1,Not a good movie,"OK, I laugh as just about anything including Super Dave skits but this was a poor attempt a movie. Some funny spots but you will wonder if you can get your hour and a half back after watching this. Those that ""really liked"" this movie must be promoting it because they have copies to sell. Don't buy this if you are looking for the same level of humor as the old Super Dave skits."
1,Who cares?,"Start with two two-dimensional characters, the neurotic angst-filled aspiring author and the lower-tier TV actor.(The latter, by the way, is played by Thomas Hayden Church, so he's certainly familiar with the territory.)Add a simple plot. Tour California wine country and get laid as much as possible before the wedding. And drunk. Throw in cardboard cutout womens and wonder why nobody laughs at the ""humor.""(I misspelled ""womens"" because they're that irrelevant here.)The one-liners didn't hit their target, the plot is so familiar, and I don't care at all about the characters. I needed 45 minutes to turn it off, but that was because I'd just collapsed on a floor mat after a workout. It really isn't worth 45 minutes of my life.But on the plus side, the scenery is truly gorgeous."
1,Spare me,Couldn't get past the sarcastic spoiled wealth to be entertained or care about these people. To be fare however it was made clear these people only cared about getting high and their own needs. Trying to be a kinder bigger person let me say I hope everything works out for them anyway. Just not going to watch this any further to find out!
1,Modern day money pit.,"This is the perfect television for the person who has too much money and a second television. Having had mine for almost 4 years now, I have replaced the lamp three times and am now having to replace the ""ballast"". If you pay full retail, that would be an additional $1400.00 in parts and service. Fortunately, some people are selling the lamps (without the housings) and ballast kits at way below repair shop prices. Even at that, this was a television which should have had a formal recall from Panasonic a long time ago. I guess sometimes technology doesn't make life easier (at least not based on my blood pressure). Consider another television...any other television."
1,Sorry Mr.Karajan,"Karajan has been hiped so much and has been marketed so well that people know karajan as conductor extrodinare, however the fact remains that his cycles of the Brahms symphonies are painfull to the ears. I own several recordings of brahms and would strongly recommend you to stay away. Sanderling or Walter are any day preferable."
1,Old myths and fictions served up again,"As documented extensively by Mather and Boswell in their ground breaking history, HANGING THE SHERIFF, A BIOGRAPHY OF HENRY PLUMMER, there simply was no organized gang, and therefore Henry Plummer was not the leader of a gang. Instead he was a hard working law man who had to be gotten out of the way for the new men from the east to take over. This book is a simple rehash of the tired old myths and fictions from Dimsdale and Langford."
1,Wedding Coloring Book,"I was a little dissappointed when I received the coloring book. I wasn't expecting it to be tied so closely to another culture and thought it would be more ""wedding generic!"""
1,Wacky,The worst thing about it is the unintelligable British accents. We couldn't understand half of what they were saying. The humor is really strange. Only watched about 20 minutes of it.
1,Don't waste your time or money,This video does not work. The belt breaks and you will not be able to get a replacement or your money back. My belt snapped and injured me and I've tried for 8 months to get a replacement or my money back. Lot's of promises no follow through. I have been very frustrated with not even being able to use the videos that sit on my shelf because I do not have the belt.
1,Pocahantas AKA Rebecca Rolfe,"I still don't understand the buzz behind ""Pocahontas"". She was captured by the English, converted to Christianity, then when the opportunity arose for her to return to her people (Powhatan,a Native American paramount chiefdom), she chose to remain with the English. She betrayed her own people in a time of need! On top of all that she supports the tobacco industry! She was married to tobacco planter John Rolfe. She also married at 19, had a kid at 20 and died at 22.Is this the kind of Woman you want your daughters to idolize??"
1,I hate myself for buying this book,There is a good reason why this book is going used for 93 cents. Don't waste even that. I can't believe I bought this book.
1,Not very Good,I was so disappointed in Up Country. As a fan of DeMille's I really anticipated his newest book. It is really quite dull. It's almost as if someone else wrote it using his name! Don't waste your time.
1,"get the hook, scrape this guy off...","Some of the absolute worst, most pretentious, emptiest, and most ultimately worthless drivel I have ever read. Jorge Luis Borges, regardless of all the idolatry that's been heaped upon him, had a surprising number of misses, and maybe nothing much to say. But I'll grant that he had a few high spots. Not this guy. Very derivative and disappointing stuff...I'll go elsewhere for literary thrills."
1,"Oh my God, this is ri - god - damn - diculous","You know, I wouldn't normally be so closed minded as to write a review on an album I don't own, but I listened to the samples on Amazon and I had to say something. This is the WORST cover album of all time by any artist. I'd be much more entertained by karaoke at a bar because the person would have better rhythm. I happen to have loved hip-hop since the beginning of it, and happen to think Eminem is one of the best lyricists of our time. I am not even a rapper and I'd LOVE to battle the joker who made this album."
1,quality and workmanship very poor,I bought the Cuisinart based on the reviews on Amazon and the price. You get what you pay for. It brews a nice cup of coffee but the top is loose. You can push it down after loading the coffee and it works. I saw the same item at Kohl's for $30 more but at least theirs wasn't broken.Review part II. Coffee maker stopped working 22 months after purchase.
1,Incredibly bad,"The only reason to read this book would be to learn a lesson about avoiding anything that has been hyped too much. This book is not only boring and badly written, it is astonishingly hypocritical: the tone is smug, self-satsified, preaching, everything that Zen philosophy is opposed to! The narrator's painfully inept treatment of his intelligent, sensitive son is all too typical: he doesn't listen, and tries repeatedly to impose his own vision of the world and of what his son should be like on the poor boy. What is Quality, the narrator asks? Well, maybe treating your child as a human being with emotional needs has something to do with it."
1,Nice Features but Poor Construction,"I have had many pumps in the past where there is an auto sensing nozzle for presta and schrader valves which fails very quickly. I have had a Ravx and Blackburn Air Tower 2 which I replaced the nozzle with the Joe Blow TopPeak Twin Head replacement and love it. I needed another pump and since this seems to be the only brand with the twin head, purchased this pump. Immediately when I received it, I noticed that it was a very poor construction. Be warned, you get what you pay for, or maybe less with this model. The plastic base wobbles and the air gauge is inadequately attached to the pump. It is suspended from the base, but in no way fixed to the pump at the top and twists. Had I known this ahead of time, I would not have made this purchase and looked for another model or brand."
1,Overpriced Shipping,"I wouldn't have bought this item if I had noticed the shipping was 64% of the price!!! I bought this item among other items from Amazon so I didn't notice the shipping cost until later. On top of that, it took 13 days to receive!"
1,The Fendi Watch that ran for only 15 days,"Watch came as promised. Given a week later for Christmas. Ran for 15 days, and now I cannot use US Fendi dealers and must get an International Warranty and who knows where it will get fixed or how long it will take. So much for a watch that supposedly costs $1200 retail and runs for only two weeks!"
1,Another almost boring book by Barbara Delinsky,"This is the second book by Barbara Delinsky that I read. Once again the story is pretty good.But everything that is worth saying is repeated so many times... It is so obvious that the author had 'so many pages' requirement for this book.I did not get to the very end of the book. Nor did I finish her first book (A woman next door). Why bother with her books then? Well, I don't believe that one book is enough to form an opinion about a writer and his/her creative work. However I think this second attempt to read and enjoy her books did it for me!"
1,That picture does not match the product,"Or it shouldn't... I have the product pictured above, and it retails at less than $300. The product called Saeco Magic Comfor Plus does cost the price listed... Company should clarify if they are selling Saeco Magic or Saeco Magic comfort plus. Big price difference."
1,Predictable! ... real drudgery...,"After reading 'Message in a Bottle', I was prepared to read yet another wonderful love story. I was a bit surprised to read such a boring, predictable, and totally depressing novel...There was no laughter and certainly no tears while reading it. I do wish that Mr. Sparks would write a book with a happy ending!"
1,DVD Not Worthy of the Movie,"I was on a waiting list to get this DVD since I love this film. Disney must have been cheaper than usual when formatting this disk, because it has no special features. Oh I take that back, Disney did manage to hawk their upcoming cheesy straight-to-video cartoons in the previews before the feature. Does that count as a special feature? There are not even director's or actor's commentaries on the soundtrack or any information about the making of the film that fans would have loved to see. The only thing we could hope for would be a special edition possibly when the film turns 20, but don't count on it. Although a disapointment, still better than a VHS."
1,gooey louie is no good,"This toy is disgusting. it is a waste of hard-earned money. i bought this game because i like boogers. but instead of playing with boogers, this game makes you play with some slob's nosehair. Two thumbs down to the ground. EEW. some people (like my mentally challenged uncle sue) may think this is fun. You may want to know that my uncle sue is a drug addict."
1,Really?,"Well, while I think much of the advice in the book is worthy, as a married woman I didn't get much benefit from the book. I felt like every other page mentioned just how much ALL men wanted sex ALL the time and women just have to stop being selfish and saying no. Really? ALL men want sex ALL the time? ALL women say NO? I don't think so."
1,Did someone else write this book?,"I LOVE J.D. Robb books but Born in Death just felt like someone else wrote this book. The writing style of not the same as the previous books. In the other books Nora doesn't use words like addy, vid, wit ALL the time and there is wayyyy too much description of what people Eve is interviewing have on. I felt that this book was not up to her usual HIGH standards and was very disappointed because I had waited so long. I will continue to read all of Nora Roberts books and will hope that she returns to her usual style of writing."
1,Works... but,"This keyboard is neat and all but the amount of force you need to use to type I fear I'll have carpal tunnel syndrome in a few weeks. Really, I'm surprised about the amount of force you need to use to type. I'm constantly backing up and deleting to position the cursor where a letter was left out. Here, I'm not going to replace any missed letters: I tpe at least 60 word a minute nd on this keyboard I am typing abot 20 to 25 becaue f the force necessary to type and ll the backing u.If you type fast and like a feather touch this is not your keyboard--you will hate this. I'm sending mine back.That said, it's flexible and cool looking. My 6 year old loves it."
1,Not so nice,"Overall, it's a nice product but it has some issues!! I ordered 3 quilts from this manufacturer and they all had problems. This one had yellowing all over the quilt at the seams and at the back. Also, much of the stitching was loose or already coming out. The colors are navy and black floral (didn't expect the black floral). The background is Ecru. If you get a good one then it's a great deal. Otherwise, keep looking. NOT a very high quality product."
1,"DEFECTIVE AS RECEIVED, GREAT SERVICE FROM SELLER","The design of this stand appears good, but mine arrived in a condition where it could not be assembled. One hex bolt was turned in so tight it could not be removed for assembly without stripping the inside of the hex head. I contacted the manufacturer for the replacement of the defective leg. They wanted a picture of the entire stand, the defective leg, and the barcode. All this for a leg that was probably only worth a few dollars plus shipping.I finally decided to just request a credit from The Musician's Friend, the Amazon supplier. Their customer service was excellent and resulted in a full refund.I was not pleased with the support of the manufacturer, but was very pleased with The Musician's Friend and would order from them again."
1,"Save your money on the ""Bundle"" pack","You can buy each season for $104.00. They come in the exact cases. When you get your bundle DVD's, they are just the season DVD's in one shipping box. This is Amazon's way of making a little extra cash at your expense."
1,WARNING!!!!! DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I got this game and I thought it would be the coolest game ever, but little did I know that this game stinks. For one you can barely steer and when you make the tinyest turn you go sliding and hit the edge and get 'zapped'. If you get 'zapped' to many times you run out of 'power'. It does have pretty good graphics though. I would deffinately reconsider getting Golden Sun instead."
1,Disappointing at Best,"After so thoroughly enjoying The Mammy, I looked forward with great anticipation to the arrival of The Chisellers. I found it a pale sequel to its predecessor. Predictable and plodding, it lacks the robust characterization that brought The Mammy to life. Do read the first novel; avoid disappointment and leave the second on the bookstore shelf."
1,Extremely Difficult to Use,"I was so disappointed with this item. It is supposed to curl and straighten. However, it was extremely difficult to use for curls : you have to hold a section of hair out with one hand, turn the iron half-way,wrap the section of hair around the iron, turn the iron half-way again, while you continue to hold the remaining portion of the section of hair with your other hand. Very hard to maneuver for the front of your head, absolutely impossible for the hair on the back of your head. Instead of curls, I ended up with crimps and bends. This iron should only be used by professionals on their clients. I would never recommend it for individual use. Considering the high price ($160.00), this was truly a waste of money. Luckily, I was able to return it to the vender for a refund."
1,Average,"By the other reviews I was expecting something fabulous. Unfortunately it didn't turn out to be quite as good as everyone else thought. This book was quite a bit longer than it should have been, as were the rest. I found myself skimming over parts because I would get bored. The characters were predictable. There was nothing that made me truly care about the characters and what happened. The last book in this trilogy was by far the worst. The ending was abrupt and ended in a way that it would make it impossible for me to want to read about the characters in this book again. If you prefer depth and strength in characters I would recommend Elizabeth Haydon, Terry Goodkind, Robert Jordan, Anne Bishop, and Robin Hobb. If you like easy predictable reads than this is your type of book."
1,Silly! Was this story contracted out to high school kids?,"Read the other 1 star reviews as they describe the silliness of this amateur production better than I can. Besides, I've already wasted too many hours on this book. I just felt a duty to warn my fellow man before they waste time on it too."
1,Tea cart needs to be packed better for shipping.,I received this tea cart and one of the wheels was missing and one was broken. The box was shredded from the metal tea cart parts shifting within the box. This all could have been avoided if the wheels would have been packaged separately and the metal parts strapped together so they wouldn't shift in the box and the parts wouldn't be scraping against each other.
1,wow,"my friend and i rented this movie for the sole purpose of there not being anything else available. this is the worst movie i have seen in my life. everything in it was terrible. the message i assume they were trying to get across was the effects of drugs in the teenage/rave environment, but the horrible acting and dialogue just made it soooo hard not to laugh. if you're looking for a movie about the dangers of life as a teenager, look at KIDS. it's sooo much better than this piece of garbage."
1,poorly laid out and written,"I had to use this book as the text for a telecommunications class. I usually am pleased with Stallings' books and learn a lot. But not this time. There are several mistakes, and not enough examples to give one a good thourough understanding the information being discussed"
1,Do NOT buy this for the PS3,This is a fraud. This item does NOT work with the Playstation 3. The Playstation 3 power cable has two rounded ends with the groove in the middle to fit into the same shape in the back of the PS3. This garbage being sold as compatible with the PS3 has one squared off end and a rounded end with a groove in the middle so it WON'T fit your PS3. DO NOT BUY FOR THE PS3.
1,Started off fine,"When I bought this filter it was working perfectly and was really quite. I took my tank down and put the filter up for two months, when I set my tank back up and hook this filter back up it was extremely loud. I've tried jiggling the intake tube, pulling it up slightly and letting it catch on it's own instead of me forcing the impeller in place, still no luck. I don't know why this happened but the filter started off great. Even with the loud noise it still cleans the tank well."
1,Not worth it,Does not live up to its reputation as being qood quality. Sure grip bottom did not prevent it from moving when placed on a carpeted floor. Worst feature was the way it sags from the edges of the top toward the middle of the bed. Quite obvious soon as it is full of air but more importantly extremely uncomfortable for two people. We returned it which is something we rarely do. I do not recommend this product.
1,Not that great,I bought these because Cooks Illustrated gave them a very positive review. I bought several pairs figuring I could give them as stocking stuffers to my adult children who all are fairly serious cooks. I tried them and they were mediocre at best. They weren't sharp and it was difficult to cut even boneless chicken breasts with them. It was like the scissors were gumming the meat. I returned all but the pair I used. I have others from Chicago Cutlery (which also come apart for cleaning) which seem to be much stronger and sharper.
1,sounds okay,"I have seen the cover box for this video on ebay. It looks kind of weird, thats probably because its in the everchanging style of the british boxes. This video will have the same director, narrator, music, and activities like Steamies vs. Diesels. I'm okay with that so long as they release normal videos with the music we love, no activities, and all of the characters. It looks like we should expect two normal videos and two wacked out videos like Steamies vs. Diesels per year. Thats okay, but HIT is a weird company. The stories should be okay, but that's it."
1,"Cute rug, poor quality","Really cute rug. It said it is washable but when I tried to clean it, the whole thing fell apart in the wash. Don't expect to have this rug for very long if you and a cleanfreek."
1,"Low, low level...","This book is really a poor book ! Read in less than two hours, it may have an interest for people who have not the slightest idea about that subject... There is no science in that book ! I regret the few bucks I have paid for it...If you read French and you want a really good book on non-verbal communication, try Jacques Corraze ""Les communications non-verbales"" that is a top level book !"
1,Trendsport Lite Stroller [...],"I bought this stroller for [...] and sold it at a garage sale for [...] Here are a list of reasons it is a bad stroller.1. The latch never stays put when its folded up so it pops open.2. The seat is very hard and uncomfortable- even when inclined it is declined so it gives no support what so ever.3. The ""canopy"" gives NO shade.4. The wheels ""get stuck"" for a lack of better description and you cannot steer it very well as soon as there is a speck of dirt.5. The seat always gets in the way when folding up so you have to grab the dirty wheels so it doesn't fall back open because it does not fold in on itself it folds so the seat and material gets all dirty and is easily damaged.6. The foam padded handle tears easily.CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP! BUYER BE WARE! I wish I would have put the [...] towards the purchase of a nicer stroller.It gets a one star for the basket size only."
1,very smelly,i purchased one of these for my son today and the chemical smell it has is just awful. i washed it and aired it out but it is still there. it is going back to target asap! i also bought a funtainer straw bottle made by thermos for my daughter and it doesn't smell funny and seems to be basically the same idea.
1,"Sad, depressing, dreary, disturbing, even horrifying","Not much more I can add to my review title; that pretty much says it all. Although, I will admit the actors did a very good job. I'm sorry I watched this movie, and can guarantee I won't watch it again.If you enjoy sad and depressing movies that are even a little creepy, you'll love this movie."
1,Well,Hard to use. Need a lot of engine compartment room to use this tool. Might work great on a truck but don't buy it for your Acura Legend
1,You need to be coordinated,"I decided to get rid of my electric can opener to reduce my carbon footprint and bought this product. I have never been accused of being good with my hands or particulartly coordinated, but this product has been much harder to use than I thought. You have to get just the right angle. I usually have to try several times to get it started. Once it does get going it opens the can really easily."
1,Dreadful. A salty bowl of dreadfulness.,"Okay. I have to admit that I usually don't eat processed/pre-packaged foods. However, I was desperate for something for lunch and picked something that looked halfway decent. After picking myself up off the floor after looking at the sodium content, I decided to just go for it. I would just limit my sodium intake at dinner this evening. I only used half of the teriyaki (?) sauce and my lips are still puckered. There are so few veggies in the dish that I don't know why they even bothered to put them in there in the first place.Never, ever again. I'll stick with Amy's instead of Annie's."
1,breaks easy,These glasses are extremely fragile. I've broken three out of four simply washing them when doing the dishes. Putting money into these is like putting it directly into the garbage.
1,Couldn't finish it.,"This book started out bad, and never got any better. I couldn't finish it because it could not keep my attention. The author spoke about different girls and the characteristics of their personalities - it was very blah. I would not recommend it unless you have a lot of patience to get through the boring part - I didn't read the end, for all I know, it could have turned out ok."
1,NOT as recorded,I am very disappointed. This transcription is NOT the same as what is recorded. The transcription for Fragile is particular poor.
1,Too Annoying!,"Like the other reviewers, I was irritated by the author's overuse of similes; and for me, they did seriously detract from my enjoyment of the story. This is a great little story; the characters and place are well done, and West makes you care about them. However, every time I would get drawn into the story, start to lose myself in it, here would come the avalanche of similes (some of them very bad)! Please, Mr. West, you are a good enough writer to do without this overload!"
1,Useful as a doorstop,"John Hodgman is an accomplished writer and has good comedic sense and timing, so why did he release this truly awful book? I'd accuse the editor of malpractice, but there is no evidence an editor was ever involved. Maybe the joke is on us, the people who foolishly purchased this wad of paper and ink. My only consolation is I bought the paperback."
1,This thing stinks,"My girlfriend was dying to buy this because several years ago, she really liked it and wanted to try it again, so we bought it. Then, I totally forgot about it, except that every time my girl friend would come home, she'd smell like onion, and I'd like be honey, how much onion did u eat today, and she'd be like nothing at all. This went on for a few days till one day she put on the perfume in front of me and I was like holly crap, THAT'S THE ONION!!!! So yeah, this perfume smells like onion on her. I hate it."
1,not exactly what you'd expect,"This product has a very easy security setup, but lacks the speed and range coverage it boasts about. If I had it to do over I'd spent a few more dollars snd done a little more research. Accept for the improved security, this router offers no significant improvements over the less than half priced units!!!! Buyers be ware I very disapointed."
1,not satisfied,I really did not see that this product hepled me in increasing my milk supply. Not only did it not help me but it has a bitter taste.
1,Very Bad,"i don't like it. it sound so normal, nothing new.. and my friends don't like it too... maybe in Poland sound good, but for USA very poor..."
1,uh......this sucks!,"This album just sucks. It's soft and it's well stupid. U thiught this would be a loud band but its not. if u like soft ot reguar rock, this is for you, it u want something loud, look at Mudvane."
1,ZERO stars!,This item has no power and is useless. I paid $10 for a similar item that works better. NO way is this thing worth $30 and it is going back as soon as possible!
1,Bad & Expensive Investment,"It lasted 14 months, working perfect the whole time. The menu was very easy for my wife to use. It will not record consistently to discs anymore. I tried the manufacturer's software update to the BIOS, Etc., as recommended by Lite-On Support and it will not perform the update! It reads the CD and goes to a black screen, but no data or menu appears. The unit will sometimes record, but the disc is not readable afterwards, and most of the time will finalize. I have not contacted the MFR for repair as I am past the warranty date."
1,Does -not- check all types of email!!!!,"Avast cannot check email that uses SSL. If your ISP will only use it, you got a problem. Avast does not report a problem if SSL mail comes in, it just ignores it. It's only if you look at Avast's Email Provider screen statistics will you see it report zero emails scanned, so it's easy to think it's working when it's not. There are 3rd party ways to work around this, but they are a pain to implement. Keep this in mind before you buy. Run the trial version and see if it works with your email provider. I understand getting it to work with GMAIL is a problem as well."
1,thought I would get three,"This product was shown as three tugs and I looked everywhere to see if it specified that it was only one tug but it didn't say so I assumed since the picture showed three, that I would get three. Well, only one came. Seems like false advertising to me. Not cool."
1,Elomo $ Cookie Monster Giggle Ball,The screw to open to replace the batteries was stripped and hard to open. Finally after getting it opened and iserting the batteries. it only worked for a second and you had to beat it to make it worked. I was too lazy to return it....
1,The hair set the mood for me.,"Ok, so I am a big buff for little stupid romantic comedies, but JLo's hair was the hair style you would see on the ""auntie"" She is aged in this film, flat, and not sparky. The whole movie was sad, I did not even wait for it to finish. I was very disappointed. The hair set the tone for the film, which depicted bad casting, bad play, and most of all bad stylist. The film was really really bad. So bad, I left a movie review!"
1,No quality,"We ordered a total of 16 units and within six months eight of them had ceased to function at all, three would only work when plugged in (the rechargeable batteries ceased to hold charge) and the others were returned new. A 50% + failure rate is a real quality issue. DO NOT purchase, as they will certainly become non operational before a year is up!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"What a cliched mess...funny, no","I saw nothing of value here. Cliches are rampant, ideas and plot stolen from some pretty great films, and just where was it funny?"
1,Doesn't work that great,The D-Link DWA-130 Wireless N USB Adapter doesn't work that well. It has a very poor quality signal. I do not recommend this product.
1,A Seductive but dangerous view of Spiritual Submission,"Christians should submit to one another. The basic premise of Watchman Nee takes a look at Spirituality Authority that turns this truth on it's head. Using a very confucian like paradigm, Nee argues for the elevation of some christians above others. This book is popular among many in the shepherding movement, and many christian scholars, like myself, find it a book that shows how easily a truth like submission can be twisted."
1,TFF at half-mast,"In ""Going To California"" we have a band who consistently combine pop sensibility with depth and insight, performing their hits with the dial set on ""slushy adult-contemporary."" I mean, they had to've been drunk -- or, more likely, squabbling. Those sax solos and the backup singers (please, Roland, tell me it was just some contract thing) made me giggle. Get ""Songs from the Big Chair,"" ""The Seeds of Love,"" or ""Elemental"" instead -- please."
1,"Durable bag, but the clasp broke the 2nd time using it","We bought the bag to take on a canoe trip. Despite the fact that it ""seals"" by just rolling up the top and then closing the clasps, it does NOT leak and will float with plenty of stuff in it.The second time we took it out on a canoeing outing, though, the plastic clasp broke. Luckily we had some rope with us that we rolled up with the top of the bag and secured it closed by tying the rope ends together.If you buy one, have some rope handy, just in case..."
1,ms . kathy,I hoped it would be better then my old battery but it doesnt hold a good charge either. But what can i do i took that chance when i ordered it.
1,BAD COPS BAD COPS!! WHATCHA GONNA DO???,The only thing I have to say is these are the only kinds of movies where the cops are a joke! At least according to Darryl Gates. Why don't there be a police academy movie/DVD gift set??
1,Breakthrough Technical Recruiting,This was extrememly outdated. It read like a bad training manual... way over priced for what it was. Product needs to be totally revamped with the new technology and the changing environment.
1,"convenient, but...","I had gotten these bags to use with a rented Medela Lactina while my preemie was in the hospital. If you are pumping for a NICU baby, nurses do not like to handle the bags to transfer the milk into the volu-feeders/small hospital bottles (if you're lucky enough even to be in a breastfeeding-friendly hospital). Nurses are still handling a bodily fluid and it's extra steps for them if you're not the one handling all of the feedings. Also, the bags do not stand up on their own, which is frustrating if you're truly pumping straight into the bag. Like other reviewers, I found that the top tab tore poorly also. They are good for fast backup if you have no other sterile reusable milk storage container, but I ended up using theMedela Breastmilk Freezing & Storage (*BPA Free) 12 Pack of 80ml Bottles in Retail Packaging #87061long-term and was very happy with them."
1,Check your local stores first.....,"I found the exact same cutter cheaper at my local ""big box"" store. On top of finding it cheaper, I wouldn't recommend it unless you are cutting very thin glass.......It's cheaply made regarding the cutting wheel, and I just couldn't make myself appreciate it. Had I paid anymore money for it, I would be extremely disappointed!This is a tough one to review. I just don't like it. I think it could have been made better, and to work more efficient."
1,Not the uncut extended versions -- BEWARE,Nothing wrong with the video or audio quality on this blu-ray double disc set. THE PROBLEM IS that both films are represented ONLY by their theatrical versions. If you have seen either of the uncut extended versions of the films then you will be VERY DISAPPOINTED in the versions presented on this disc set. Both films are included on disc one and some nice extras are on disc two. But the extended uncut versions of each film are so much better than what is offered here. Buy these films individually in their extended uncut versions. The same extras offered in this double disc package are also offered on the single film versions.
1,"Great Idea, Excellent Cast, Boring Results","A superstar passes away, and his managers/publicists/writers are unsure of their futures in the biz. If they can take a no-talent ""Blue Collar"" guy and transform HIM into a star, then their place in history is assured. Or somethin' like that - it's a novel idea. Too bad that Everett Sloan, Phil Harris, Keenan Wynn, Ina Balin, John Carradine, Peter Lorre, and Scatman Cruthers are saddled with downbeat dialogue and stilted direction. But there are a few hilarious scenes (his first rehearsal, his first club appearance, and an incredible Ed Sullivan self-parody)."
1,I think I bought snakeoil,"If there's a how to cure book I've read it. So far none of them have worked - including this one. Exercise, eat right, take care of yourself, have a good attitude, meditate. I already do these things, and yes, they do help, but ONLY because those things would help ANYONE.Do they CURE it? NO. I'm not cured. I have good days, but then BOOM, the pain starts and it is like I'm getting the flu. Nothing will have stressed me out, I won't be 'mad.'In fact, I'm a pretty happy person with a great life, and a horrid nervous system. I think I bought snakeoil, again."
1,Interesting history but the man cannot write decent prose,"This is an easy way to learn a little about the history of Charleston. But the narrative and the writing are so bad that it makes you wince. It's hard to understand what the role of the editor was, especially when dialogue is called for. Any good editor should have been able to sharpen up this silly unrealistic blather. The narrative is like the Perils of Pauline, with people being thrown under trains, eaten by crocodiles, etc. The reality was bad enough without all this dopey violent melodrama being dragged into it. Hard to understand how anyone can be a ""fan"" of such a mediocre writer."
1,DON'T BUY TO SKY BOX!,"""I wil never come back to buy in SKY BOX-USA.It has been my worst experience in Amazon.com. The company sent me a refurbished monitor and the page didn't say that no was new.They sent me the monitor in a package which was not the original, and it came with a broken corner.SKY BOX didn't want to pay for the returning,so i had to buy another one.BE CAREFUL BUYING TO SKY-BOX, THEY'RE CHEATERS."""
1,This product is really unreliable,"I was really excited to plug my Zune into this so that i could listen to music in my car. However, when i began to play a song before it got to the end the tape would pop out. I cannot tell you how annoying that is. I am going to best buy to get another one because the one i got is clearly faulty."
1,May well be the WORST book I've ever read,"Although Brunner foresees the influence of a national ""datanet"" and the book sports a sort of hacker/phreaker hero, you can tell the author quickly made the story up as he went along. The plot is so disjointed and utterly contrived, it seems to be the work of an 11 yr old. Throughout, Brunner tries to impart deep social truths which are mostly just half-baked, thoughtless whimsy. I knew I shouldn't have read the whole book - It really was a complete waste of my time."
1,Quality is very low.,"Got this for my son for Halloween. He tried it on and went outside and the pants ripped within a half hour. The pants were not too small/tight on him and they didn't get caught on anything. They just ripped while he was running around. My husband was there and saw what happened. Extremely disappointed. Not that I expected great quality, but I thought it would make it to Halloween. Not so much...."
1,YES I AGREE PLEASE SHUT UP IF U HAVEN'T PLAYED IT,"Gamer from Seatle, Wa you copied that off the frickin descprition of the game you said the same thing the company did of course they're going to try to make it sound good. The game is already out we dont need any more Previews of the game that is not going to help anyone."
1,"Product is good, free gift offer is not true.","This product lived up to my expectations, but you should be warned that the maglite offer is not true. I ordered 5 of these for groomsmen at our wedding (about $150 purchase) and did not even receive a single maglite even though the minimum purchase was $25 and every knife we received repeated this offer. I wrote in about the error and never even received a reply email. Just a fair warning if you are buying this brand over another for the free gift."
1,Does not hold charge well,"This is okay for regular pictures, but as soon as the flash is involved, the charge goes down so fast you can only take 2 or 3 pictures with the flash before you're out. Also, it doesn't hold charge well when it's not being used.I'm using this with an Olympus C-765UZ.I would not recommend this battery. Go with the OEM Olympus/Sanyo battery instead."
1,Waste of money,"This c.d. isn't worth more than 2 bucks at best. Track 4 has some pretty cool guitar riffs, but none of the songs have any dirction. They sound like a retarded version of Dream Theater, and I have a feeling that they were trying really hard to copy them."
1,I stopped reading a third of the way through,"I thought this was going to be a great book. I heard good things about it and it started out great. But, then I was just completely bored and not into it. I kept waiting for something to happen and maybe it did; I just wasn't patient enough to stick with it."
1,"Another ""Eagle"" end of the road","I saw this favourably reviewed elsewhere and tried it. My comments on ""Long road out of Eden"" also apply here - innocuous, often pleasant stuff, but nothing that really reaches out and grabs you (or at least me). It seems that the Eagles and their spin-offs have all reached the ends of their roads and should stick to the ""oldies"" circuit, living off past glories.P.S. I am informed by J. Wade below (thanks!) that, although this CD is recent, the recording came out 30 years ago, so the last sentence of the review may be ignored. The rest still stands."
1,Kindle version,"So many typos in the Kindle copy, you spend more time translating than actually reading this version. I have owned the hard copy of this book for years and have read it dozens of times but had to stop this time about 10 pages in because whoever at Kindle proofed the copy needs to be fired for gross incompetence. Ended up returning for a refund and will stick to my paperback for this one."
1,Awful Book.,Going through the tutorial that came with the WinRunner CD is 100 times more helpful than this book. Do not make the mistake of buying it as I did.
1,Don't Bother.,"The sound quality on these is poor, and you will find yourself immediately replacing them with something better - so don't waste your money. The center speaker sounds muddy and is not as good as the built-in speakers on my Toshiba TV - we don't even use the center speaker because it is so difficult to understand spoken dialog with it. After about a week I replaced it with a Polk (admittedly more expensive)."
1,Rats! It has happened for a fourth time.,"This is the fourth time I have bought this product from different purveyors and each time the wide-screen version refuses to load. Guess I will have to watch it in full screen. For only $5 it isn't worth returning, again."
1,Bland,"After falling asleep three times while reading this book I decided it was not for me. The worst part is that I could not seam to remember much about it at all, it left that little of an impression on you. The story is just not inventive."
1,This was the most dissappionting movie i've ever seen.,"Streets of Loredo is terrible! I have never been so dissappionted in a movie in all my life. James Garner does not give Woodrow Calls character justice,neither does Sissy Spacek as Lorena. In my opinion they trashed a great novel by McMurtry."
1,Another clunker...,"I've come to see Fr. Seraphim Rose as the radical far fringe Orthodox analogue to far fringe Roman Catholic traditionlists like Fr. Feeny. I'm not speaking to many wonderful and spiritual adherents to the Latin Mass, or to deeply mystical Orthodox brethren, but the hyper-rigid and narrowminded xenophobic radicals that populate the fringes of all religious groups. This book has very little to offer, it is quite uncharitable and Fr. Seraphim betrays a shocking lack of true knowledge of the trends and spiritual traditions he attempts to take to task. There are a few nuggets, ergo the single star, but mostly this is the musing of a hyper-rigid radical, cranking off rounds from a theological bell tower."
1,The one draw back of this game,"the games on this are typical domino's and play well.The major draw back is the tile shuffling ability I have found there are only 2 different shuffle arrangements and I am beginning to memorize them I am regularly getting lower scores because of this In a short while the game will lose its appeal.minor issues are i wish it could keep scores and names ,to get a sharp contrast on the screen it has to be held just right. It has a narrow field of view."
1,An overall okay movie.,"Cheech and Chong's: Things are tough all over. The people at Amazon movie sales said that it was one of Cheech and Chong's funniest movies yet. I think Amazon was totally wrong. I found just one part of the movie to be funny, and that's it. I wish I could send it back and pick out a different Cheech and Chong movie, but I already opened the package."
1,Fouled my pond,"This product turned my pond milky and created pockets of bubbles on the surface. It took many days to clear. The manufacturer did return my call regarding the failure of this product but they said it was due to my particular water conditions. NOWHERE on their own website, nor on their Amazon description, was there ANY warning about a specific, necessary water chemistry for this product to perform as advertised. While the maufacturer's rep answered my questions he did not show any concern or care about the situation. Even after I explained to him that I had used their enzyme products for nine years.I rely heavily on the reviews here and hope to help others avoid wasting their money. The maufacturer refused to refund the price of the product to me."
1,Another serving of cold hash that just doesn't feed the mind,"Even vampires know when something has turned from meal to corpse, for Stanley it seems the sucking won't stop even if the meal has turned to ash. The Millionaire Next Door was the best by this author, but stealing a page from Hollywood the sequels just don't measure up to the ""promise"". Kudos for the author for trying to extend his oil well even though it is a dry well."
1,awful,"those who enjoyed this book keep asking why readers keep purchasing these books if we are opposed to all the sex. the answer is simple....we are hoping eventually laurell will come to her senses and start putting out books of the same calaber of the first 7 or 8 anita blake books or the first merry books. too many readers have noticed the downward spiral of both of these series. just because we dislike the constant barage of sex doesnt make us a bunch of prudes. the thing i have enjoyed about the earlier books is getting to know the characters without dropping their drawers and exposing their genitals upon introduction. the readers who have been along for the ride since early anita can heave a sigh and remember the good old days of action, suspense, and many pages of fully clothed characters."
1,One Minute Alarm??,"Seriously, an alarm that sounds for a total of one minute?? I'm a fairly heavy sleeper and I would be scared to depend on this alarm to wake me for anything. The alarm is not very loud to begin with, and only goes off for one minute (timed by a stopwatch). Unless you're one of those people that wake up very easily, avoid this alarm at all costs!!"
1,Yawn..........,"I just don't understand the hype about this one.This book was a big yawn, and I realized this early on, but I continued reading all 700,000 pages (so it seemed), hoping for an eye opening ending. I never got it.First off, maybe somebody needs to help me understand the need for splitting the book into two completely different stories? Stories that had no climax nor reason, and where the 1st 'story' had no ending!!I would not recommend this to anybody who likes a page turner. Maybe you just truly have to be a King fan?"
1,"Product damaged in both Stomp rocket, jr and high performance stomp rocket","I purchased this for my 4 yr old godson, and was so disappointed when his mother called to ask for the order number as the rockets were damaged. I figured it was just a fluke, until my nephew opened his ""high performance stomp rocket"" that I got for him off amazon and two of the rockets were stuck together, one being completely smashed, and the fin off another one. He completely ripped open the box in his excitement to get to them when I wasn't looking, so it would be hard to return. I was so disappointed in this product. The company needs some serious quality control and a look into the shipping and packaging of this product."
1,Not really worth it... but hey did deliver early!,"For what it really is, not worth 5 dollars.. didn't notice any difference. Cheap looking little piece of plastic that, to me, should be somewhat rubberized but no, just a little 10 cent little piece of plastic..... no thanks. Not even worth returning!"
1,Overrated...,"I decided that I needed to finally read this ""classic"" and what a disappointment...The novel isn't written all that well (despite the comments to the contrary) and is filled with non-sequiters (not in a good, fragmented Dos Passos way), jumbled fill-in-the-gap flashbacks, and poor prose. Additionally, the novel suffers from an extremely contrived plot and climax. I'm sure at one point in the history of American Literature this could have been seen as a clever and biting indictment of the upper crust of society, but reading it in 2007 exposes it as only another variety of the boring 19th century society fiction in the same vein as Austen, Bronte, etc."
1,bad chemical smell even after several washing,"The plastic emits a really bad plastic smell, I wonder if the smell gets into the breast milk stored in them too. For caution, I don't recommend them."
1,This video stinxs!,"I love the Secret Garden but this video just stinks it all up! The girl that played Mary was utterly annoying, the way she said, 'CurtainS and fountains of roses."" was HORRIBLE! Notice how i say HORRIBLE! The boy that played Colin was also annoying, after someone says something he'l say, ""I like that curtains and fountains of roses,"" and blah blah blah BLAH! Dickon was okay, he wasn't the greatest, and i didn't like how he could see the future, he was a STRANGE dickon. Doyour self a favor and DON'T REPEAT DON'T Buy this video."
1,THE GREY,"THE MOVIE WAS ALRIGHT, SUSPENSEFUL, THOUGH IT LACKED A GOOD ENDING I THOUGHT. I LIKE THE MAIN CHARACTER AND HIS ROLE IN THE MOVIE."
1,Disappointed,"Although this book has a few useful tipsI was disappointed with the recipesSuch as Pickle Roll.Piece of cheese and a dill pickle.Roll cheese around pickle is the recipe.Tell child how to wrap pickle around cheese and eat.Or ""prepare ahead of time""I was disappointed I paid money for a book to tell me to wrap a piece of cheese around a dill pickle and called it a recipe.Also I noticed repeat recipes.Even one side by side on two pages. (pg. 40)Peanut Butter sandwich with some orange juice.Next page, exact same, but add some raisins.Seemed to be nothing more than a page filler."
1,Not compatible,I was unable to play the dvd because it was not compatible to my Sony. I wish the this would have been displayed somewhere when reading the product description.
1,The title was the best part...,"So I just finished watching this. It was sort of entertaining but compared to Day of the Dead it wasn't good. The acting was bad, the story was fair, but lacked some explanation. The only real good part was the gore. Cheesy, yes, but cool none the less. At least the ""actors"" weren't the pretty boys that star in most modern horror films although I presume that's beause of the budget. Rent this one for the hell of expanding your zombie movie knowledge but it is mediocre at best."
1,Waste of money,"I had a badger brush from the local big box store, thought this one looked a little better. I was really dissapointed. Doesn't look much like the nice rounded brush in the picture, more like one that got a bad haircut. It was jagged, much smaller brush in proportion to the handle. And the darn thing is uncomfortable to use - a green scrubby from the kitchen is softer. It is probably the last Tweezerman's product I will try."
1,This is the worst math textbook I've ever had.,"I took a Real Analysis class at Cal. State Univ. Long Beach a year ago. William Ziemer's son, William Ziemer, was the professor. Even that didn't help. This book is impenetrable from every angle. It's good for stopping bullets and flies across rooms rather well, but that's about it."
1,Kangaroo Krap,"I saw this on a bus from Shaoxing to Hangzhou. Dubbed in Chinese with Chinese subtitles, and I was listening to THE LIVE ALBUM by The Charlie Daniels Band. I didn't need the sound to know this movie is horrible. Lemme quit editing my books and write a new one about kangaroos wearing sunglasses, and Mafia money, and funny Hollywood fat guys being funny Hollywood fat guys, and farts. Lots of farts. Shakespeare, Lu Xun, Dickens, James Joyce, Dr Seuss -- didn't they all insist on at least seven fart jokes per page?"
1,... higher expectations (?),"Well, I originally heard this song on MTV, and then I heard 'Brighter Than Sunshine' in the film 'Just Like Love'. After I saw the appearing everywhere, and seeing VH1 talk about Aqualung, I figuired that it was going to be great. So, I decided to purchase it. I guess I expected to hear more songs like 'Just Like Love', but most of the songs were sung in his high pitch head voice, and really slowly. 'Just Like Love' is about as upbeat as it gets. Not to mention, 90% of the songs are written about a depressing love experience. But, I'm sure, just like all of my other albums, it will grow on me, and I'll likely wind up liking it the most. Just don't expect so much from this album like I did."
1,Pillars of the Earth (Blue-ray) A Bad Joke,"I've been around for many years and this is a first. Ordered ""Pillars of the Earth"" (Blu-ray). Much to my surprise when I opened the bad shrink wrapped case there were two (2) ""Memorex"" blank CD-R's. I'm wondering if this was a previous return where someone ripped off the two Blue-ray disks. Needless to say, I'm returning this for a replacement. Hopefully will have a more constructive review once I actually receive the proper disks.The Pillars of the Earth [Blu-ray]"
1,Poor quality phone,"I'm an old AT&T customer. I was going overseas and wanted a Quad phone, so I paid $249.99 for this at the Cingular store, plus $25 to unlock it so I didn't have to upgrade my phone plan from the existing converted AT&T to a new Cingular plan. I am returning it tomorrow. The sound quality is poor, the menus are confusing, and I get no reception at my house or in any of the small towns nearby. The only places I can make or receive calls are the major highways. I'm keeping my Sony Errickson T616, even though it doesn't work in Asia/India/Africa. The quality is far superior."
1,"Not funny, bizarre - or maybe I don't get it?","I, too, waited with baited breath for this DVD to arrive - thinking that I had a rare comedic treat in store. Instead I found a plot that is plain old bizarre. While I did get a laugh or two, I couldn't find anything to write home about. I have to wonder if the movie-going public is so desperate for entertainment that ANYTHING the least bit different is greeted with cudos. The friend that I watched it with agreed with me that it was strange. Neither one of us enjoyed it and, indeed, wondered what drugs Jonze was on.Frankly, I thought it didn't have a plot. The charactors are pretty much disagreeable. And, it's not very funny. Different, yes. Good, no. Maybe I don't get it? Maybe I have pedestrian tastes in movies? Whatever it is, this is not one I want to watch again."
1,Too silly for me! I like real dinosaur books.,How Do Dinosaurs Get Well by Jane Yolen is a silly book about dinosaurs. They are sick and have to take their medicine. It is also about the dinosaurs getting well. I did not like the book because I do not like fiction. Dinosaurs couldn't go to the doctor because there weren't any doctors when they were alive. I would change the book because it does not show dinosaurs in their habitats.
1,"Good Flavors, But Definitely Not Worth The Price!","I don't know what was worse, the packaging, the amount of time it took for me to receive this item, or the ridiculous pricing tacked onto such tiny boxes. They couldn't have been more than an inch thick, each. All of the flavors were unique and delicious, but reminded me greatly of M&M;'s, so I could not enjoy them like I might have if I'd gotten them at a price more deserving.Do yourself a favor and don't waste your cash on this tiny treat! Heed my words!"
1,Cheap Material!,I bought one these handgrips and it broke after only about 1 month of light use. It makes a lot of noise and is made from cheap plastic material. Do not waste your money on it. You get what you pay for!
1,Not the best resource.,"I did not find this to be very helpful in planning for my upcoming retirement. To be fair, I have looked at several retirement advice books and not found any to be of much help."
1,Not exactly for dummies,"I bought this book after purchasing another book on Frontpage that was way over my head. I bought it thinking that it would be basic enough to begin to learn how to use Frontpage but it is not. It is similar to the other book describing features of Frontpage that I do not understand. I have used other ""Dummies"" books to get a start on a subject but this did not help me at all. I think it would have helped me to have some examples of how the pieces go togather. There are plenty of technical works on Frontpage to go to once one has a basic idea. In the beginning of the book John writes that ""it is assummed that the reader knows how to use the keyboard and the mouse"" The reader has to know much more than that to get a benefit from this book. It is probably a very good book for someone with some experence with the basic concepts, but it was not helpful at all for me. I went out and hired someone to build my webpage."
1,Too Hard,"This game is very very hard. The concept sounds cool but i would not recomend to purchas this item. After about the 2nd turn everyone just says this is impossible. Then everyone starts working together, not using the board, not doind the right turn, and looking through all the clue cards. It is not a fun game in my opinion"
1,I returned this book!,"I was going to give this book to a close relative and their son when they lost their baby. But I was very disappointed in this book. I actually thought that it was horrible! I myself would not recommend it to anyone especially not someone you love and care about! However I did purchase Mommy, please don't cry... There Are No Tears In Heaven by Linda Deymaz!It was much better and I do recommend it for anyone!"
1,"Good visibility, poor materials","I really have only one gripe with this mirror.It's made of a very hard and brittle plastic. This, when combined with expanding fasteners for the screws to spread apart when tightening, shatters with the slightest impact, and sometimes just from overtightening. I've gone through 5 of these mirrors in less than a year. I first ordered one due to the good reviews and the appearance (in the photo) that it was flexible to reduce the chance of breakage. My bike is a commuter, and I usually park it on the centerstand, but every so often it falls over. Result, broken mirror.If you buy one, buy a couple spares. Otherwise, be very careful setting your bike down and don't bump into anything with the mirror or it will break. I'm switching to a more durable hinged model."
1,Not a good thing,"Just imagine if all the people who hated you talked to an author who was writing an unauthorized version or your life story. Would the account be a true picture of you as a person? Such is the case with this book. Clearly, because it was an unauthorized bio, the only people who would talk to the author were the people who were either jealous of, or had an ax to grind with Martha Stewart. The result is a one sided unflattering account of one of the greatest self made persons of our time. Why, I was expecting the author to try and trace Martha's ancestors back to Satan! I would not, therefore, recommend this book; unless you enjoy unwarranted hateful attacks on an american icon."
1,TERRIBLE,"I thought these would taste like regular oyster crackers, but they are pretty tasteless. Not even as good as stale bread altho they seemed to be made out of bread dough."
1,creed,The item seems completely fake and it smelled not like a creed perfume. I finished returning the two i bought.
1,An Offbeat Mess,"Something went very, very wrong when Warner Brothers decided to do this version of the Maltese Falcon. It appears they decided to lighten it up, although I'm not sure if they were going for full out comedy. The result is a strange mess that succeeds neither as comedy or as detective mystery. Warren William overplays the detective hired by various people to locate a horn full of jewels. Bette Davis overplays the femme fatale, and various character actors overplay the rest of the gang looking for the horn. The mystery is a bit confusing, despite the fact I have read the book and seen the superior 1941 version. I guess you could kindly say this version is offbeat. It was too offbeat for me!"
1,About this CD,"This CD is the same as WWF We gotta wrestle. Not to forget, it is the same as WWF THE MUSICS VOL.2 only has Jake The Snake Roberts Theme by removing Ken Shamrocks Theme."
1,Disappointment,"I am very fond of both of these actors, but this movie bored me to tears. It basically annoyed me from the beginning with the several screen shots at the same time, which I understand some might see as more challenging and artistic. I just want a good story that I don't feel lost in the whole time. It also helps to have more likable characters. You really want your characters to have chemistry, and I just wasn't feeling it. I enjoy the cleverness of all the Oceans movies, and I was hoping for a movie along those lines, but it was not."
1,Season is Great. Product is horrible.,"I was very excited to be able to buy this season and since I wanted to keep, I paid extra for a new copy. When I got the dvds, they were really scratched and dirty. Some of them played with no problem while others skipped and froze. I contacted support about the problem and they sent a replacement saying it must have slipped through the cracks. Replacement came same problems. I also bought two other seasons of survivor that were Manufactured on Demand and had the same results. Don't waste your money on this. Hopefully CBS will release good copies in the near future."
1,Creased spine....,"There was a crease in the spine, which I didn't think would matter. The pages are already falling out!"
1,this man is a snake oil salesman,"i am a psychiatrist in the bay area. i have seen many patients who have been taken to the cleaners by this man. he is taking snippets of science and feeding back a gumbo of non-useful information to vulnerable patients and familes. he charges exorbitant fees for work-ups that are superfluous and then makes vague, all-encompassing recommendations. he does none of the treatment himself. he is a charlatan. do not buy this book and add to the fortune of this dangerous man."
1,Very Very Disappointed,"This game is an extreme disappointment. It takes up a HUGE amount of space on your computer and then when you try to run it it is very slow and often freezes up. This is by far the worst sim game I have tried. Normally, I am a big fan of them. I would not recommend this game to anyone...unless you like spending more time waiting for the computer to catch up than actually playing the game."
1,One of the worst films I have ever seen,"It is absolutely incomprehensible how this film made it past the cutting room.Begiining with its ridiculous depiction of North Slope oil workers as a bunch of drunken bums(I have been there and seen these guys, who are usually too tired after their shifts to do anyting but eat and sleep)and continuing with Liam Neeson's shallowly drawn character (Why does he want to kill himself if he casre so much for his family?), and the outrageous depiction of wolves, who will not come within miles of a human if possible, thanks to people like Mr. Neesom's character who shoot them on sight, and ending with the alpha against alpha finale, the words trite, ridiculous and downright stupid are way too kind for a piece of garbage like this. Avoid it if possibile."
1,Insidepulse Movies - Mike Noyes,"The way Blood Junkie starts is one of great promise. It captures the look of old '80s horror films very well and even manages to get the pace right, which most modern slasher flicks miss out on. However, despite these two key ingredients, Junkie fails to provide a satisfying meal...Read my full review here:[...]"
1,merchandise problem,"Although I am sure that Cuisinart has a good product, I ordered the HENKEL set of cookware. It was a gift and, when the Cuisinart cookware arrived, I did not go to the effort of returning the item. When I first realized the problem, I wrongly assumed that Cuisinart owned HENKEL. Recommendation - be very careful, if you are ordering HENKEL cookware through AMAZON."
1,Purchase with caution,"The USB light never turned green (which should indicate that it's charging). It never stops flashing red (which indicates that it's searching for a receiver). It never syncs with the thumbpad. Be careful when purchasing this item. Some have claimed success, others have not. Unfortunately for me, I'm in the ""have not"" category."
1,Slowly put the book down and run away,"I collect books of this nature. I put Lenard Ashleys book on my wish list. I wish my husband hadn't wasted his money. Some of the information in the book is informative. Some of it is interesting. The authors attitude throughout the book was very snide and belittleing. How lucky we (the readers) were, that he could teach us how superstitus, primative and especially stupid we were. His cutting remarks about Wiccans, Witches, Christians, etc, left no doubt that he felt above it all. Perhaps, his other (five) books are written the same way. I don't know, I haven't seen them in the bookstores. If I had had a chance to flip through this book in a bookstore, I would have slowly put the book down and run away.Anyone want to buy a used copy?"
1,"Old version is, by far, more superior","I hate the new disgn of this product. The detachable battery pack sucks. We have the old version for our 18 month old and he loves it and uses it to soothe himself at night and I wanted to have the same option for our 7 month old however, this version is horrible. I wish they would not have redesigned the product. It was great the way it was."
1,living under the shadow,"Interesting to see what the descendant of Jean-Jacques is up to. Well, it's a shame really."
1,very poor quality,"i bought three of this item. upon pulling the cord out for the first time two broke instantly. They litterally broke apart with bits of plastic falling off. one worked just fine. the company was responsive and replaced the two broken ones with no questions. however one of the two new ones broke apart immedialty too. i would say stay away from this product. if you really want a retractable cord, i think it is worth while to spend a littel more on one that is better quality. in this case you really do get what you pay for."
1,I will not recomand this transaction,I will not recomand this transaction. One you see before you buy and after it ...................
1,Poor shave for the price,"While the ability to clean the razor under running water is a nice feature, it hardly makes up for the poor shaving performance of this product. I have owned multiple, more basic Norelco eletric razors which all gave better shaves than the 9160XL Smart Touch. Do yourself a favor - if you're going to buy a Norelco razor, purchase a less expensive model and use a brush to clean out the whiskers."
1,Another amway,I have had chronic infections in my throat and was told about all the amazing things this product would do for me. I had several friends taking it for various ailments. I was told to take 4 packets a day for 3 months which I did. The ONLY thing that I noticed was that I had less money than when I started. My friends saw no improvement in their health either. Maybe this works but it did not for the four of us. Maybe its the power of suggestion maybe it's not. I know one thing. There are alot of people getting rich selling this.
1,Misleading Information,"I purchased this at the recommendation of someone. Going through it, I found many, many inconsistancies. I gathered that the information from this book is based off Roman Catholic Doctrine. I am not happy."
1,Bore-rine,"I've read 2 other Walter Mosley's and that's it for me. He's too sloooow and most of all empty. He's character are not very interesting and the stories always lag, drag and fizzz out. I don't see how the reviewers see Walter Mosley as a black writer with something powerful to say about the black condition/experience etc. He hasn't said anything, let alone anything profound. In fact he doesn't even scratch the service. He should be writing kids books because that is where his composing skills have remained. Snails think faster than Walter Mosley."
1,Blu-Ray Transfer is Pure Trash!!!!!,.....I Bought the Robocop on blu-ray Expecting something special but boy was i dissapointed....theres absoloutely no diffrence in picture quality compared to the DVD and they have the Audacity to charge more $$ for this Trash Transfer....if you buy Robocop on Blu-Ray you will have A DVD in A blu-RAy case...purely for die hard FANS only...definitely not Worth the Money...NOT RECOMMEMDED!!!!!!!!!
1,Lord of the Rings,"I bought this set and had it sent to an inmate in a correctional facility in Florida. It apparently never arrived. This may have to do with prison policies on used books, but I never received any notice that the books had been returned or any reimbursement."
1,This product is dangerous...,"I bought this toy for my 6 1/2 month old. He is able to sit up on his own, however, like any other baby, he does fall over in all directions. So, when I gave him this toy to play with he was very amused by it and was thoroughly enjoying it, especially being able to CHEW the rings. Then I noticed that he could fit the yellow cylinder (attached to the base that you stack the rings onto) all the way into his mouth. So I was concerned for his safety that if he fell forward he could lodge it into his throat and obstruct his airway. I have contacted fisher-price and they are picking up the toy from my house for a full refund. I think you should not buy this for a baby that doesn't sit completely stable on his/her own, maybe not until 8 or 9 months old."
1,Out of date Jack Daniels mustard,I order the mustard Jack Dasniels in february and got it to Sweden with my friend in mars and the date wasBest by 11-03-12. So it`s old when I got it . I order 12 bottles and at least half of them has the date.
1,"Okay, but buggy","Like all video editing equipment for your computer, you'll need a state of the art system. If not, expect to run any rendering overnight. The software is much slower than other programs out there for video editing. Also, make sure you've striped your tapes before EVERY record, or else the box will lock-up frequently. Once you've got everything in place, a systematic way to create your projects, and know how to overcome the poorly designed GUI, the box works great! Oh, and once you've got a stable version running, don't upgrade! This is a flawed product for a hefty price, but if you want to save your VHS tapes to DVD, it works (I've been using it for about six months now)."
1,Poor effort,"Listening to a record company that tells you not to release something? Sounds very sell-out-ish. And the record really shows it too. Ripped off riffs, lame lyrics. It's a horrible cd all the way around. Too bad because Ryan used to be one of my favorite songwriters. Love Is Hell is better, but only slightly and only because the lyrics are very well-written as compared to the junk on Rock & Roll."
1,Poor quality,"The pictures are dark and blurred and it is hard to make out the alphabet. It is not useful for teaching children the alphbet, it is not even attractive."
1,Poorly Written,"While I have a lot of admiration for Swensen and his accomplishments, he has difficulty writing in plain english. Unlike his earlier book, supposedly he wrote this book for the masses and not just portfolio managers. Unfortunately, the book is just simply loaded down with unnecessary portfolio/finance babble, which makes this book difficult to read and dense as wood. It is too bad, because Swensen puts forth a number of important points in his book, but their effect is diminished by the author's poor writing."
1,Total Garbage,"This album and this artist should never be heard. There were sooo many more talented people on American Idol when she won. This album is a perfect example of that. All the studio effects in the world can't help this over-rated, so-called singer. You can't make chicken salad out of chicken s$%^."
1,Dumb book.,"The book is about a guy who likes eating jaw breakers, but would often choke on them. Despite his affliction, he continues to eat jawbreakers. The story ends when he ate his last jawbreaker and it went through his ears which caused him to be deaf. After becoming deaf, upon leaving the hospital he got ran over by a New York taxi."
1,MAJOR SNOOZER,"ONE OF THE THREE WORST MOVIES EVER MADE. IF THIS IS ART THAN WE SHOULD THROW ELEPHANT DUNG ON IT AND SHOWCASE IT AT THE MET. I'VE READ MANY ACCOUNTS CONVERNING THE PACIFIC FRONT IN WW2, GUADALCANAL IN PARTICULAR, AND THSI MOVIE DOES NOT DO IT JUSTICE."
1,sound was awful,Very poor film with even worse transfer to DVD. I literally had to turn up the volume to its loudest just to barely hear what was being said. This movie stinks now and even by standards of the day it was made it stinks. I'm afraid that's the kindest I can be to this film.
1,Peter?s Woven Grass Mat for Rabbits,Rabbit liked it too much... tore it to pieces... it didn't last very long... and he's a small dwarf rabbit!
1,inop for Seiko Kinetic,doesn't appear to charge the watch movement at all;maybe a continuous and/or high speed setting would work.I wasted the money for this product.Tech Swiss Double Automatic Watch Winder With Built in Timer Rotates 1 Hour and Rests 3 Hours.
1,Nowhere near as good as the TV show,"I am a big fan of Felicity on TV, but this book doesn't comeclose to how good the TV show is. The biggest problem is thatFelicity in the book doesn't sound like Felicity on the show. The dialogue is wrong. Whoever wrote this book needs to study the TV show more."
1,Meh,"I thought when it said black, it would completely black out the windows like I needed. Not a fan and I didn't know there was a special spray needed either until I read the enclosed directions."
1,"Sorry, I've had enough!",I have to agree with the majority of the reviewers at this point. Its a slap in the face for Season Two to be half the amount of episodes as Season One yet virtually the same price as Season One. To those reviewers who say don't boycott because they might not offer them anymore....I say fine. What these movie studios don't quite seem to comprehend is that we don't need them.....THEY NEED US!!! I'm at the point now where I don't care if they offer it or not; I'm tired of this blatant corporate greed. I'll save my money for something else that I truly do need!
1,Shame !!!,"Okay, look. My brother and I have a personal grudge against this disapointment. First off, how in the heck did an alien get on board the SULACO ?Sigourney Weaver (aka Baldy in this one) didn't care to even preserve the characters who survived, so killing Hicks and Newt- poor Newt, so she can cash in on her pay.And the effects were not good. I could tell the alien effects were not generated well. Again, shame !!!"
1,Pass on this one,"First, this is only the first half of ""Little Women."" Yes, this is the book originally published under that title, but usually it is bundled with the sequel, ""Good Wives."" This volume only covers the period up to Meg's wedding.Second, this adaptation has taken all the color out of the work. The descriptions of the girls and their friends are missing, as are descriptions of their clothes, home, etc. Alcott herself wrote (ch. 1), ""...young readers like to know 'how people look.'"" I question the decision to leave out the descriptive passages as they are some of the most interesting writing, especially to younger readers."
1,It realy flys and for at least ten minuets,It's crash proof.....I am an RC pilot and I highly recomend this to everyone...
1,I don't like it,"I'm not a fan of classical music. I a fan of pop. I only wanna say that I don't like this cd. The singing here is awful. No feeling, just coarse shouting all the time. The singing can learn a lot of pop singers in terms of feeling and maybe even technique. Fit for the bin!"
1,I was hoping for more.,"I've seen pics of Goldie with the Dali Lama and was looking to get a spiritual picture of who she is. I found this book to be very elementary...just entries into a diary, she did try to sound deep but it came off as stale,I wish I hadn't been disappointed! I consider myself lucky that a friend had the book so I didn't loose $$$$....sorry Goldie!"
1,Nasty soap,"Bought soap for granddaughter who can't use any kind of soap, she didn't like it, it looked like green mud. She would use it and bated the way it smelled."
1,Car,I bought 2 gift packs for a couple of 2 year old's. It was shipped out very quickly. The cars look very cute but don't waste your money. All the plastic parts broke off the first time the boys played with them. The parts are also tiny and a coking hazard.
1,Waste of Money,What a waste of money! The handling on the vehicles are horrible and the races and weapons are pretty weak. Mario Kart is so much better and worth the money. I will return this one.
1,Texsport Heater unsafe,"The first time I tried this heater the gas squirted out from behind the black plastic control knob, not from the tank/heater connection. Very unsafe product. Texsport says to send it back. I would not recommend this heater. Will be asking for a refund. You get what you pay for, cheap is cheap. Peter."
1,2 Lame,"Another DEEP film by this director. It is so deep that not even God could ""get"" it. I could even make a film if I didn't have to offer a plot. No art here."
1,The Dud of Steel,"Don't let the positive reviews fool you. The ""Superman"" serials are poorly made and not even good for laughs. Kirk Alyn looks OK as the Man of Steel, but gives a rather cheesy performance. I'll stick with George Reeves."
1,Why would you use all the languages in one track?,"Too confusing. I thought this dvd would have a spanish track where it woul go through all the attractions in that language and not just combine the whole thing. I would not recommend this dvd, there are better dvds that baby einstein has. Don't buy this one."
1,Lacks Insight,The book is not inspiring and lacks some kind of professionalism. I would better buy P.E.T. or some book from Haim Ginnott.
1,Please hide this away from the children.. and not for being scary!,"This is a very, very sad installment for any J-horror movie lover. It's not scary, creepy, or entertaining in the least! I couldn't even force myself to watch the last 3 of the movies because I felt the life draining from me as I sat and watched them.I do not suggest this for any horror movie lover, like myself. Just let it collect dust with the poor people who bought it and are trying to resell it here."
1,A Mess of a Movie,"I found this movie to be virtually impossible to follow, the actors two dimensional, and even after the movie ended I still couldn't make any sense of it. I hung in there until the end hoping that it would at one point suddenly come to make sense like ""The Butterfly Effect"" did for example, but with ""Soul Survivors"" this simply never happened."
1,Almost nothing on colored stones and crystals,"Having lived near Virginia Beach as a child, I admire Cayce's work, and was looking for a book on the qualities popularly ascribed to various semi-precious gemstones in order to be able to tell customers something about various agates and jaspers and lapis and the like if they ask.I was expecting quite a number of stones to be listed and their properties or qualities described, with a clear index.This book must have been produced long after Cayce's death. It only focused on a couple of stones, and was highly repetitive.This is a case of, if I had been able to flip through an actual copy of the book, I would not have wasted my time or money on it because it did not meet my needs in any way. I am not sure what audience WOULD find this information useful, but for someone seeking information on the properties of semi-precious stones, it was worse than useless."
1,Buyer Beware,The description may say one size fits most but this hat was giant! Not even with the velcro strap does it fit an average adult's head. Now I have to pay a ridiculous amout to return it. Not a happy customer....
1,Depressed? Buy this to get further depressed,"(Even one star is too high of a rating!)I'm not as qualified as other reviewers but here I go any way. This was the first book I read by Dr Phil and what a disappointment. I 'was' a fan of his TV show until I read this book!I found myself getting depressed while reading 2/3's of the book and simply stopped reading it. We all know our past experiences impact who we are and how we got where we are. He really did not need to take up 120 pages telling us that.I turned to ""Your Best Life Now: 7 Steps to Living at Your Full Potential"" by Pastor Joel Osteen to pick up the pieces. :)It's a matter of preference but if I want to feel better about who I am as a person I'd rather not read something to make me relive experiences that I have already come to terms with.If you want to get positive about life, go for something POSITIVE. But it is NOT this book!Good luck!"
1,Not worth it,"Unfortunately had to use this one for two corses. It's a paperweight and nothing more. The set up of the text is good but most of the time it felt like the guy got bored. Basically, here is a start and the rest do your own reasearch. If you have lots of spare time on your hands, this book is for you. If not, try David Anderson's books instead."
1,Disappointing!,"When the best tune on the album is a needless remake of something off your debut album, something is wrong. That is the case here and I have officially given up on King's X. The word ""lame"" kept coming to mind as I listened 3 or 4 times to this album trying to find some redeeming value. Compare this to ""Gretchen"" and you will know why I am dissappointed. Maybe my standards are too high for these guys but the album is a large bore. Sorry."
1,"Excellent viewing, poor quality","Easy to view, no set-up needed. But it failed in less than 90 days, xx:ox number does not light up."
1,Pitchy and Overproduced,Overproduced to compensate for weak vocals. She lacks the range and can't hit the high notes. Pitchy Pitchy. Somewhere Over the Rainbow is to big of a song for her. She is no Judy Garland. My Destiny has the worse lyrics. Combine that with her voice and its a no go. A total lack of feeling and emotion in her voice...
1,Wish I had my old vacuum back...,"My old Samsung had a pretty short cord, which drove me a bit crazy, but otherwise it was a great, lightweight, easy to use vacuum cleaner. This Hoover Tempo has a long cord, is fairly lightweight and the bag-changing is easy. But... it doesn't work well on all of my rugs. I have a couple thick ones, and it works pretty well on those, but on the area rugs with low pile it sucks the rug up and makes it very hard to push the vacuum across the rug. I get a work out every time I clean my house. The manual adjustment is easy to use but feels cheesy, as if it will break off soon. I have tried every height adjustment on my thinner area rugs, none of them work. Another pet peeve -the cord wrap design defies logic - really awkward and the person who designed it should be hung by his/her thumbs."
1,useless mapsend software,"I should have read the other reviews prior to ordering. The software is so old it will not run on any of my computers, not even the oldest one I have. If I could get it to run I'm sure the maps would only be quasi useful given that so much has changed in the last decade. What a disappointment and a waist of money. I should have gone with a Garmin GPS and in the least never tried to purchase this software from this seller who should be ashamed for even trying to sell it as Windows compatible."
1,Hot its not,I did everything I could to get this coffee maker to make hot coffee. I ran the thermos under hot water and filled it with hot water before I brewed my coffee but the coffee was not hot. By hot I mean it was readily drinkable. I even heated up my coffee mug. The coffee in my old Krups is hotter. I did not notice any difference in the taste between the Krups and the Capressa and I was using $12 a pound coffee.
1,Agree with 04.25.2012 entry by Wii Fit Mii,"Until this morning I would have written a good review. However, this morning it started hissing, popping, and smoking. Unplugged in a hurry and opened the windows to vent the house before the smoke alarms went off!! I got an enjoyable year and a half...now it's back to the drawing boards. Agree with Wii Fit Mii...keep your fire insurance up to date..."
1,can't buy it :(,I want to buy this movie but it doesn't exist in amazon.co.uk for region 2 (for Turkey).It's only for region 1 :(
1,A Horrible Terrible Book,"This book really stunk. The idea is good; two girls, one is moving away, everything is changing, the girls find a mermaid in the swimming pool, there is romance, the mermaid goes back, the girl moves, the end. That's why I gave it two stars instead of one. But of course, the glitch. the print is huge. The wording is boring. There is no reason to buy this book unless you are a 6 year old girl that is obsessed with fantasy."
1,crap,mug and bits are both crap. Bits all broke and mug leaks out the lid and bottom. Not a good buy.
1,Bull sticks now much thinner/don't last,"My dog LOVES this product and it does help keep her teeth tartar-free, BUT the stick is much thinner than in the past and my dog can now chew through one in less than 1/2 hour as compared to 2-3 days in the past. Too expensive and too dangerous as she will swallow the stick when at 4"". Company called and they had no explanation for why the sticks are thinner, so will buy the thicker braided 12"" sticks through another company on Amazon (1/2 price vs. store pricing)."
1,Not what I expected,"I bought this book on the advice of a co-worker thinking it would be a reference book for writers; I was surprised to find it to be more a personal story with writing references buried within.The author Lynne Truss, a British woman, writes well but injects an ever so slight hint of aristocracy and snobbishness toward the masses. In one particular story, she relates receiving a pen pal letter from an 8th grade girl from Detroit. The girl's writing was juvenile and poor and Ms. Truss replied in a condescending manner to put the girl in her proper place (grammatically). Ms. Truss states she feels bad about doing so, but reading between the lines, one senses a triumphant pleasure in telling that American girl how she borders on illiteracy.If you think this book will be a ready desk reference and aid you while writing, think again and look elsewhere. If however, you want an easy read with personal anecdotes of one woman's obsession with punctuation, this book may be for you."
1,TERRIABLE,"Got the spray for my daughter, turned her skin orange, I wouldent waist my money..Suggest lotion probable cover the skin better"
1,He is old.,I am a great fan of Ravi Shankar but I have to admit that this is probably his worst performace that I have heard. I don't quite understand the 4 or 5 star ratings - this performance is full of flaws. It would be difficult to listen to more than 5 minutes of any part of the entire CD without pointing out atleast one flaw - and I am being generous whe I say one flaw every five minutes. He is surely a genius and my favourite sitar player. If you have some background of Indian classical music you will not want to purchace this CD - you will not even be able to listen to it once.
1,Horrible Customer Support,"As previous comments have elaborated on, the LinkSys system is easy to install. The reliability of the product, however, is poor. I have had several times I have had to shut down and restart the router in order for it to regain configuration. When troubled by router problems, I attempted to download updates from the internet, to no avail. (The download was in an extension that my computer did not recognize.) Thus, I had to call customer support. You should know that this company outsources its customer support to India. The technical support team does not even hear your issue without suggesting 1. that you buy their technical support package; or 2. that you buy a new Linksys router. I would not recommend a Linksys router to anybody in the market for one."
1,Another mindless Hollywood production!,"I give this movie two stars just because the FX are pretty good, the action is very dynamic (somewhat MATRIX style) and the women are very, very hot! The acting was not good except for the main character, and the plot is as simple as a blank page. Overall: MEDIOCRE."
1,Dino deserves a better biography than this,"Dean Martin, one of the most successful entertainers in history, deserves a better biography than this hastily written, poorly edited, work of pulp."
1,lost battery power after 18 months,The first Sonicare from Walgreens lasted over 5 years. This one lost recharge capability after 18 months. I'm going back to Walgreens.
1,Awfully bad,"Wow, this film was beyond low quality. It truly was one of the worst films I have ever seen. It isn't scary. The make-up/gore effects are terrible. The acting is laughable at best. The plot is filled with more holes than a block of swiss cheese. But... speaking of holes...That is about the only positive this movie has going for it. The film features tons of female nudity (fairly graphic as well). I can only recommend this flick to those masochistic folks out there looking to be tortured for an hour and a half.Yeah... I'll be buying it. What can I say... I am a complicated man."
1,worse than pirated DVDs,"What a disappointment! I thought I got a pirated DVD. It's even worse.The camera angle was too high, often cutting the toes/feet of the dancers and leaving a huge empty room above the dancers. The swans dancing/standing on both sides were often partially cut off the screen.I had recorded another Kirov version (laser disk or LD, not a live performance, by different principals) before. It was much better. Too bad it's not available on DVD."
1,This book is not for physicists,"As I said this is NOT for physicists. And ""Cosmological Natural Selection"" is nothing but a junk. There is so much philosophy in this book. Well, I didn't like it."
1,Worthless,"This cd is crap. I can't believe anyone would spend this much money on club music, much less this junk. It's mindless, terrible music, and just worthless overall. Save your $$$."
1,DVD is not even close to CD,"I first bought the CD which is out of the world great!!! So I was excited to see the DVD and ordered it. Much to my dismay the DVD did not have ANY of the great songs of the CD. Missing were, Pink Cadilac with the Boss, Rock n Roll with Jimmy Page, Rod Stewart and many others. I cannot understand how the DVD and CD have the same name??? Very disappointed"
1,Do Not Buy!!!!!,"Beware! I bought this for the specific reason that it was a digital tuner. I wanted to use this at the gym where they broadcast their TV audio on specific stations. Imagine my disappointment when I tried to use it the first time AND YOU CANNOT SELECT THE FREQUENCY. The only thing this radio allows is for it to ""scan"" and ""lock in"" on a station. The reception was beyond terrible. Avoid at all costs!!!!!"
1,Waste of money for me,"Since there are a ton of variables that go into milk supply, I would never say this product would be ineffective for everyone, but it certainly was for me. I started taking it right before my son started on solids at 6 months, partially because he hadn't gained ""enough"" weight the month before and because I was very nervous about my milk supply dropping when solids started. I took it according to recommendations - I actually took it with absolutely no water or food (it certainly isn't the worst tasting thing I've ever had in my mouth). I finished the bottle and saw no difference in my supply during or after finishing it. I work 3 days a week and pump twice a day on those days. I was pumping about 4 oz a pump before starting the tincture; pumped about 4 oz while taking it; pump about 4 oz after finishing it. No difference whatsoever!"
1,Constantly Freezes!,"I would've given GTA 4 Four stars but every single time i play it it freezes, and a lot of ppl have had this problem. The things i don't like about the game is: No character costumization, no safehouses to buy, and missions are very repetitive and similar to previous GTA games."
1,"Died, HP refuses to support","Printer worked quite well for a while, print quality and speeds were what we expected. Then the printer began giving error messages indicative of an internal hardware error.I called HP thinking (stupidly) that they would stand behind the quality of their products. they asked for some numbers inside the printer, then told me that it was out of warranty, and I would have to pay $40 to get technical support. I find it funny that they never bothered to ask when I bough t the printer before stonewalling me with a claim that it was out of warranty.So now I have a paperweight, because I refuse to spend$40 just to find out what replacement part I need to order to fix HP's garbage. This printer lasted half as long as my Epson inkjet.DO NOT BUY - The company that makes this product refuses to stand behind it."
1,Dissapointed,"My daugher just got this doll for easter, and first of all the doll is stuck bent to the side, and the leggs are too long for a barbie doll, my daughter had a hard time dressing her and the music box only plays one song"
1,"Good printer, but does not last long","I purchased this printer almost a year to the day that it broke down. It did everything that I needed it to do, however, it jammed and no longer will initialize. Because of the cost of repairing out of warranty, I will probably purchase a different product rather than repair this one. I spent a week trying on my own to repair it,and then discovered my warranty had run out. Hewlett Packard has online help, which was not able to fix my problem either. My last printer was Hewlett Packard and I never had a problem with it. Because they are building everything with cheap plastic now, I am disappointed in my 2210xi printer. I used to brag to everyone about how wonderful my first printer was, and now I am bummed with this one."
1,DOES NOT HANDLE WELL,I HAVE AN OEM VERSION OF OFFICE 2002 STANDARD EDITION AND I AM HAVING NOTHING BUT PROBLEMS. I CONSTANTLY GET A MESSAGE STATING THAT WORD PERFECT (10) OR QUATTRO PRO HAS ENCOUNTERED A PROBLEM AND NEEDS TO CLOSE. IF I WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF SOMETHING THE INFORMATION I WAS WORKING ON MIGHT BE LOST. I HAVE DOWN LOADED SERVICE PACK 3 AND HOT PATCH 4 AND I AM STILL HAVING PROBLEMS. IS THIS BECAUSE I HAVE AN OEM VERSION OR WHAT? SHOULD I BUY A NEW PROGRAM OR GO UP TO VERSION 11?
1,Just Don't,"I bought this program awhile ago, and I absolutely hated it. I no longer have it. It crashed constantly and although it had many good features (landscape, exterior, decks, interior), it was difficult to use...and yea theres plenty of better programs out there"
1,Not an accurate representation of the Leo Frank trial,"There were some issues getting this DVD to work properly that I never experienced before with other DVDs. I have heard others say there were some possible defects with it missing portions of the miniseries and so forth. I was finally able to get it to work and what I saw was appalling. This miniseries makes a grotesque mockery of history and what really happened at the Leo Frank trial. Dozens of people did not stand up in the middle of the trial and start singing with the result of the trial coming to a screeching halt. This miniseries about the Leo Frank case is one of the most racist, prejudiced, dishonest, slanderous and defamatory treatments against Southerners ever produced."
1,Petsafe Bark Control,"It works until the dog gets used to it, which takes a few days. Thereafter it's ineffective. Can't recommend it."
1,Is Freedom A Final Event In Time?,"This collection was put together years after his death. The title is perhaps a bit misleading. Is it really essential K? Is it all one needs to read to capture what this guy talked about in 60+ years? Is it a good first reading?There's also a fundamental issue with the title ""Total Freedom"". It's a misleading title which may imply the traditional conditioned notion that Freedom is a final event in time. That is not the case. As a young friend recently said, people like the idea of freedom being a final event because they're lazy and want a guarantee for the future!Anyway, it is important to not believe what K says. Question everything and find out for yourself if there's truth in it -- then it's first hand truth and not so because he said it. And by the same token, if you find something he says to not be true, you can discard it."
1,This is the worst car,"this is the worst midget car. when i herd about the zipzaps at rdio shack they were alot better. even u have to wait on the waiting list who cares. so go to radioshack to buy zipzaps, they are the best."
1,drywall stripper,"I bought this item with the idea of saving time it worked great until I dropped it, which was about three hours into the day, the cheaply made star wheels that score the paper bent over now as you can imagine it leaves a wavy line instead of a nice straight one, I am very disapointed with the quality of this product and would not buy another one"
1,Undead DVD pack,Disappointed did not know the movies are old black and white classic movies wanted newer movies that where in color.
1,Boring,"I learned nothing about Nero`s life from watching this movie. It is a story about a man who wants to live a simple and happy life but his mother has bigger plans for him. So she kills many people in order for her son to become Roman Emperior. Perhaps a better title for this movie would be ``Nero`s mother.`` It`s a fairy story about prophecy, Nero`s mother, and Nero`s relationship with a slave girl. Instead of a movie about one of the worlds most interesting historical figures."
1,cheap junk,"The retractable mechanism broke irreparably the 3rd time I used it...just snapped and flew into pieces. It's a nice idea. The cord still works. But, the spring-loaded retractable feature is junk."
1,Wouldn't recommend this cloth diaper system.,"I bought 3 dozen of each size to cloth diaper my daughter.Pros:1.No diaper cover needed.Cons:1.Drying takes FOREVER2.Didn't see the savings (from running the dryer 2-3x each load)3.Big Time diaper rashes. Even though I frequently changed my baby.4. Constant leaking out the sides of diapers, urine and BM'sAfter discovering Fuzzi Bunz and Wonderoos (one size pocket diapers). I Ebay'd all my Kooshies. And couldn't be happier.I wouldn't recommend this diaper system. Look into Fuzzi Bunz or Wonderoo's you'll be much happier."
1,Nice music but track 'clips',"This is a great song; nice and melodic, smooth and very relaxing. However, I have downloaded this track twice from Amazon and both times the track has 'clipping' which has fried out and ruined my front right speaker (I listen to music in 5.1 Dolby Surround). I hope Amazon fixes this for future downloaders because it is a very nice track."
1,Good piping but bad songs,YES it is good piping and the man is a good piper however the choice of songs is not enjoyable listening music. If you what good-old bagpipes this is not for you. If your looking for elevator bagpipe music then this is it. I gave my copy away after the first review.
1,Great topic but all fluff!,"I just can't understand the 5-star reviews this book has received. After two years of research and focus groups, all the author could come up with are self-evident keys to meaningful work like ""Respect"" and ""Acknowledgment"".The ""Reality Check"" assessments of each of the 22 keys at the end of each chapter provide the only real substance in the book.This extremely important subject deserved much better treatment. Far superior presentations of similar topics include:In Good Company - Don Cohen & Laurence PrusakIntrinsic Motivation at Work - Kenneth W. Thomas"
1,"Not his best work, no doubt about it","After reading several books from the series, I decided to obtain the very first book and see (or shall I say ""read"") how it all started. Although the book goes through all one needs to know about the history of DISCWORLD, the book lacks the magnificent humor and sensetive touch Pratchett uses so talently later in the series."
1,Not recommended,"I bought these earphones for my mp3 player. I just have one question. Where's the bass? The bass is pretty much nonexistent. The crummy earphones that came with my mp3 were a lot better than these. Awesome design but without the sound, it's just an expensive paperweight. Not recommended at all."
1,Avoid Memorex at all costs,"Yet another horrible Memorex product, designed to just waste your money (and INK!). The covers will NEVER EVER line up with any other standard DVD case insert template, You''ll waste a ton more money trying after you've been bilked buying this crappy product.Memorex really should be put up on fraud charges for the endless bunk DVD-Rs, CD-Rs, labels, tapes ect ect they've bamboozled people with over the years. No more."
1,"decent sound, horribly uncomfortable to wear","Even after adding foam pads to these suckers, they're just horribly painful to have in my ear, even for a few seconds. I forced myself to endure the discomfort and try them out with my mp3 player, and aside from the physical pain, they actually sounded pretty decent. Not an incredible amount of bass, but they're pretty loud and accentuate the mid trebles a bunch. Sony used to make a similar all-black model to these that sounded great and weren't so physically oppressive to the ear. Unfortunately, my old ones stopped working so I tried these - what a mistake. So I guess if you're into an intense, pinch-like pain on the inside of your ears & mediocre sound quality, these headphones are the perfect match."
1,ZERO STARS!!! THEY SEND OUT-DATED ISSUES.,"Please do not purchase this magazine unless you like reading old news and enjoy making a scrapbook of expired coupons. I ordered this magazine in December only to receive a November issue in my mailbox during the second week of January. So I suppose I am to take all of the Christmas gift ideas that are in it and apply them to next year. And I am so looking forward to getting February's Valentine's issue in time for Easter. - What a joke! Mind you I did contact their customer service who bascially said ""yeah, that's right""."
1,Plants that refuse to grow!,"The blue pots that the plants come with are pretty cute.Unfortunately the peat type soil that the plants are supposed to be grown in is apparently not conducive to plant growth. I tried for months to grow the plants and even replanted some seeds when nothing grew. After many months of regular watering (apparently that's all you're supposed to do) and moving to the best spots of sunlight one of the pots grew plants and I saw the stirrings of life in a second.These grew to approx. 4 inches, withered, grew yellow and died. A strange white fungus like layer formed on top of the peat soil. I threw the entire thing out and have kept the blue pots and blue tray in the hope of trying smg else.Do not buy this. It will not grow."
1,crap nothing but crap,This was not worth the few dollars as an experiment. I would not waste the time downloading this even. Fail Fail Fail.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK.,"I wasted my money, please don't waste yours. The book covers Sendmail in less than 30 pages and is a beginners course on how email works ""generally"" and how good Linux is at being a server. There is no real help offered in this book. It's sole purpose was to get money from people who are looking for a ""good"" book on Sendmail, especially seeing as how O'Rielly can't even make one.Anyway, The people who wrote and published this book should be neutered."
1,Disappointed Fan,"This movie is so disgusting, it's hard to put into words. I was extremely disappointed with it. I consider myself a pretty big Jim Carrey fan (I even liked The Cable Guy)but this movie is stupid, offensive, and worst of all, not funny."
1,Lacrosse Technology TX^U Wirless Temperature Sensor,The product was used and did not function wih my unit. A terrible purchase on my part.Certainly would not recommend this product to anyone. I would more likely tell how I spent my money for a inadequate product.
1,Nothing like Final Fantasy X,"This game was a HUGE disappointment. I loved FFX, but I couldn't stomach 30 minutes of this ""sequel"". They've turned Yuna into a pop-star, the characters get new abilities by changing dresses, and the battle system is ""real-time"" -- which I might have given more of a chance if it wasn't for the very disturbing dress-changing sequences and annoying character commentary.The game is 'girly' -- in the absolute worst, stereotypical, pink frilly dress kind of way. I'm disgusted to think that this is what is being marketed to young girls and that Square felt the need to replace Yuna's sweet serenity and maturity with this half-dressed pop-tart image.In my opinion, this game should not be considered a sequel to FFX. Between the changes in gameplay (I liked the CTB system!) and the new girly theme, this is just too different and FFX fans would probably be much happier replaying the original than taking a chance on this game."
1,A Waste of Time,It only got the 2 stars from me because 1. The cute title and 2. The cover. The book took forever to peak and was focused more on dropping designer names than giving us a plot.
1,Totally overpriced and overwhelmingly silly...,"This is a 12-page promotional piece for Kouzes' and Posner's books and Leadership Practices Inventory, a 30-item questionnaire about leadership, written in the breathy style of business-school literature. A true non-value. If you are interested in their work, buy The leadership Challenge (Jossey-Bass, 1997), which has the same editorial tone but at least says something."
1,I too wanted to like it.,"I received the Zune for a gift. I was very excited, the Zune has a larger screen, it is thicker and more durable than the ipod and it has the radio tuner. After spending 2 days trying to download the software and many many phone calls to their technical support (which by the way is less than helpful) I decided to return it and get the 30gb ipod that was set up in less than 1/2 an hour. I love my ipod however I wish that the Zune was a lot easier to use and transfer my Grey's Anatomy episodes on. Tech support told me that it really is developed for mainly music right now and eventually in the future their marketplace will offer movies and tv shows. Unfortunately by the time that happens there will probably be a newer version of the Zune and this one would be absolete."
1,review,"Only read this book if you want to learn about the history of legal practice. It's written by person about his own experiences, and there is very little actual advice. I was dissapointed about how little, if anything, it taught me about interviews."
1,"Cute, but very small","I bought this for my miniature poodle but it is way too small for her. The puffy sides use available space in the bed making it smaller than it looked. Price is kind of high for the quality. It's very cute, but more appropriate for a toy or teacup-sized dog."
1,DONT LISTEN TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE ONLY HAD IT FOR A MONTH,"This is crap after about 9 months. If you dont mind paying 150 for something that doesn't last, go ahead and buy this. BUT TRUST ME. THIS IS A PIECE OF CRAP. Yeah, I loved it too after a month, now it is making me want to throw it into the ocean with all of the pain and frustration it has caused me."
1,P.O.S.,"Enough said. Buy a different charger for your controllers. On the up side, it was so inexpensive, it isn't even worth paying to send it back."
1,9.5-10 For Riding Abilities,"Unfortunately I was not able to see this DVD which I purchased as my DVD player would not accept the DVD. I understand now that DVD's produced in different areas of the world are coded differently . I am disappointed that Amazon did not indicate this in their description of the DVD. Unless you have a DVD player that is ""Region Free"" do not buy this DVD. I personally will not be buying any furthur products from Amazon."
1,If you like eating the Nonstick Coating Enjoy,If you like eating the Nonstick Coating Enjoy!They all stuck to everything that was made & the Coating came off when I Cooked & Cleaned it. Go for Circulon or Technique.
1,What happened to love?,"I am not surprised the author did not talk about romantic, emotional feelings for other men. Most gay/bi men find it impossible to repress physical attraction for other men but often repress their emotional/romantic feelings for other men so completely that they don't even know they are capable of such feelings. They are confused because they are missing the one big piece of the puzzle that would allow them to make sense of their lives. Hint: homosexuality is not about behavior, it is about feelings and that includes love, friendship, intimacy, and relationships. The author has much more to learn and more people to apologize to."
1,Not much for Mac Users,"The book offers a wealth of information for PC users, but unlike the many very common guides which include illustrations for both Mac and PC formats, only 3 of this book's 200+ pages offer specific guidance for Mac-users.Samples, examples, and illustrations are of the authors' favorite PC Programs while only mentioning Mac options on one or two pages.I will offer that theory, practice, and concept are pretty thorough but as for practicality for Mac Users, I beg, please guys... do a Mac version."
1,"Great film, poor new DVD release.","An excellent film, but a tradgedy of a new DVD. The video quality is not restored at all and is sadly littered with scratches, jumps and a lack of clarity similar to the earlier Gold Collection edition. There's no clear line on whether it's the correct aspect ratio also becasue Disney were making different ratios than this film is presented in at the time (Rescuers Down Under) and so it seems strange that they'd jump backwards in futureproofing considering Walt's accumen regarding the Future and technological advances which must, even after his death, still echo through the halls. I find it very sad that classics like Bambi and The Little Mermaid can be treated so well and restored beautifully - and there was NO attempt to give this easy-to-love film a treatment it deserved. The only feature on here of any worth is a 6:32 feature about film making and a static art gallery. The other extras are all off other DVDs. Very sad. Naughty Di$$$$$ney!"
1,Don't waste your money,"This is not a chair your baby can stay in for three years. The seat doesn't sit up, so my 15 month old slouches while he's eating. We've had nothing but trouble with the tray for the last few months. I have to beat it every day to get it off and on. We called Evenflo and they told us the tray was defective, but wanted to charge us for a new tray. They also couldn't guarantee that a new tray wouldn't have the same problems. Life is too short to fight with a high chair everyday. We're buying a different brand."
1,An Inaccurate Translation For A Politically Correct Age,"The New Living Translation is sold as a modern bible for the rest of us who have difficult with half-a-millenium old English. Unfortunately, it fails to live up to its billing. While the language is modern -- it abandons all pretense with regard to telling the reader what the original autographs actually said. Its use of dynamic equivalence in translation is suspect, as is the motivation and views of those that created it.A far superior alternative: the New King James version, by far the most accurate modern language bible available today."
1,Not as advertised. Beware of false left handed claims!,"These scissors seem to be good quality but they are not left handed as advertised. They obviously did not spend much time making there ad page. Amazon gave me a full refund in reasonable time, no harm no foul."
1,Plodding,"A dull tome, uninteresting and overpriced. Might make a good doorstop perhaps, or be excellent for starting fires, but I wouldn't suggest the book to anyone I might run into again.The author seems to have only a slight grasp of the subject. Important concepts are overlooked, and it seems to have been written for ego gratification or to drum up business, rather than to explain the concepts of asset protection.Take a pass on this one."
1,Tough Read,Found this book extremely difficult to get into. Too much character set-up and too much about relationships prior to getting into the guts of the storyline. Picked up interest about halfway through.
1,Glad I rented it instead of buying it,"I thought this game was the worst. We put it in the PS2 and after about 5 minutes took it out and returned it to Kozmo.All you do, is gather like objects together with the X and then set them off for a fireworks display with the O. There is competition, but this is NOTHING like Tetris.WASTE OF TIME."
1,Not VeggieTales as you know it,"This one was a big disappointment. The animation is great, but there is no humor. There is no Bob and Larry, no silly songs and generally it is a very dark and serious story. The characters are not very likable at all which is a big change from previous films. The main characters don't look like veggies but some kind of green stick figures with hair. Not good. Too dark and depressing for the very young, mine didn't like it at all and they are always requesting VeggieTales."
1,THIS IS NOT A COMPUTER CRIME NOVEL!!!,"Despite the description and synopsis on the books cover this is NOT a computer crime novel. In fact with the exception of about 20 pages total the novel quickly looses its snazzy cyber crime appeal. In the first few pages we're introduced to a dark haired female hacker but just as quickly she's gone and the book spirals into Japanese gangs, corrupt police, horribly bland and indistinguishable characters, and it just sucks from then on out. The story is good albeit incorrectly marketed. The characters however have no identity! They all sound the same, with the exception of the Japanese characters. Sadly the book lacks serious writing talent, very little character development, on what could've been a good story. One positive note perhaps is that the descriptions of Japanese culture, etc. are really good. Perhaps this is due to the authors departure many years before from England to Japan. My advice: spend some time abroad again."
1,Disappointing exploration of Kantian Cosmology,"Langton has yet again exhibited her strange prejudices for the sensual in discourse. Instead of providing us with an interesting discussion of the things-in-themselves debate, she has opted for the dull strategy of deflating ""hyper-Idealism"" by using the Idealism-by-default hypothesis. This is not a wise strategy and fails. Sad, as Langton is a promising man in the field."
1,It's broken already.,"In an earlier review (which I deleted now) I gave this TV 5 stars and mentioned about a problem that it froze once and I did not expect it to happen again. Well, I am wrong. After 38 days of owning the TV the picture is disappearing on a daily basis and is being replaced with various color bars. The TV does not respond again without a hard reset. When I called Toshiba this morning to complain about this, the customer service agent seemed to think this is no big deal. After a while on the phone I was given a phone number of a local service center and told to contact them and get it fixed. I am now on my own with a broken TV and a local service tech. I'll also update how that goes.After spending a couple of thousands it all boils down to lousy customer service and bad karma. Isn't that a purchase to be proud of ??"
1,Overpriced markers,I bought these for my 5 yr old who loves drawing. I can't believe I paid $10 for 4 markers. She was never able to blend the colors properly. The darker color always over-powered the lighter color. These markers are nothing special and certainly not worth the money!
1,Not up to par,"Very disappointed with this release. First, it does not seem HD quality at all. The stories were also mediocre at best. I'm a Batman fan, but only liked one or two of these (last video in particular). The animatrix was much better made than this collection. Rental at best. But if you're set on buying, just get the DVD version. Can't imagine it can be really much better than the Blu edition."
1,CRAPPY BOOTLEG.,They sold me a crappy bootleg copy of southpark. The second and third discs didn't even work!
1,Disjointed Stinker -- Gets a 9 on the Sominex scale,"This is my last Op-Center purchase. They have slid downhill since the first, and Balance of Power is by far the worst technothriller I've ever attempted to read. The cast is large and hard to follow since there appear to be numerous political groups at work to bring down the Spanish government. For all of that, there is the infuriating trademark conference between Op-Center regulars that drones on and on trying to set up and explain the plot and the political premise and background. These conference meetings between protagonist Paul Hood and his staff have a very strong preachy tone about them of which (I infer) it seems the authors wish the reader to become aware of these horrible socio-political injustices that make up the plot, as if they exist. I stopped trying to fathom this book on page 269 and literally threw it away."
1,It's the thought that counts,"Somebody gave me this book for a gift, and I really have to say it's the thought that counts. I've read two other books by David Hagberg, in the hopes that he could get one right just by the law of averages. Unfortunately, my hopes were dashed. I can name many other authors who are more than adequate substitutes for him, books that make you think(Tom Clancy, Larry Bond, Stephen Coonts, Len Deighton, John Le Carre, Frederick Forsyth, just to name a few). If you want to read a book about a resurgent Russia, read Icon by Frederick Forsyth. The bestseller lists are a good acid test for the techno-thriller genre. If it doesn't make it there, it's probably not worth reading."
1,Mixture of Old (Wonderful) and New (Lackluster),"Larry Niven has written some wonderful books featuring some of the best ideas in science fiction. This book is half-and-half. The wonderful part contains a handful of delightful short stories from his 1976 book ""Flight of the Horse,"" now sadly out of print. The not-so-wonderful is an almost unreadable new novella set in the same universe. Mars is popular these days, and Niven should have been able to do a smash-bang job of working it into the ""Horse"" universe. Instead, he wrote a lot of dismal dialog and murky exposition with none of the life of the older stories (which I eagerly reread, confirming that they've stood the test of time).I could give this a mixed review: a compromise between five stars for the old material, and one star for the new. But save your money and look for a used copy of ""Flight of the Horse."" And shame on Niven's publisher for not just reissuing a great older book and leaving well enough alone."
1,clunky art-house fare,"Look, I appreciate that this film (1979) is based on a stage play (1836) that is highly regarded by critics, but it's hard to tell why judging from this film alone (or even from reading the play, whose reputation is such that it's actually included inThe Norton Anthology of World Masterpieces (Expanded Edition) (One-Volume)). The original play was left substantially unfinished at the time of the author's death, so what you see here is Herzog's (controversial) sewing-together of various plot elements, not to mention his chronologication.If you're unfamiliar with the material, you'll be beset by questions until nearly the end, and Herzog's direction careens from heavy-handed to indecisive throughout.As for Kinski, I'm not sure if he actually had any ideas for the role other than staring bug-eyed at the camera. He's far more compelling inAguirre, the Wrath of GodandFitzcarraldo."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Why I do not like this cd is that the Metallica cd's they made in the 80's where good and hard, and now all we got on this cd is a bunch of sissy crap! ""Ride the Lightning"", ..And ""Justice For All"", those were good cd's. This is not good, for us hard metal rockers we want hard stuff, I like Metallic, but this cd just doesn't fit my tastes as does I am sure many other hard rock Metallica fans. The only remotely good song is ""Until it Sleeps"", and you can get that on singles. We Metallic fans want the hard stuff, the way it once was, and unfortunatly is not on this cd, the music doesn't sound right."
1,Can't travel with travel cup,The cup has a lid that does not stay on. I wish I had not purchased. It is a travel cup that cannot travel.
1,RAMOS ruins his own credibility as a journalist,"Jorge's defense of Spanglish is very backwards and I find it strange that a respected journalist such as himself would give in to defending the inability to speak correct Spanish and at the same time, putting down the Real Academia.This certainly not the view of the majority who view Spanglish as a contamination of Spanish through English.Spanglish is basically the language of impoverished Hispanics, many of them who are almost illiterate in their own mother tongue and the reason for Spanglish's rise within the EE.UU. is beacause they lack a proper vocabulary and education in Spanish and the ability to adapt to the changing culture that surrounds them in the EE.UU.Fortunately what saves this book is Ramos's defense of undocumented workers."
1,Hooray for quadruple dipping!,"I don't have anything insightful to add that hasn't already been said by 1,400 other people. The bottom line: this package exists ONLY to dip in the money well and will be quickly supplanted by the complete blu-ray set in the near future. Buy this only if the definitive editions don't appeal to you."
1,Very unstable and getting worse,I have had this router for over a year now and have had nothing but trouble. each firmware version fixes old bugs and adds new ones. I have spent countless hours with their technical support team with NO luck. If you get a hold of an honest technical support person at linksys they will even admit this router is very buggy. Most are trained to sound like this is the first time they ever heard the bug you are describing. With the latest firmware they finally got the IPSEC to be somewhat stable but now the router resets the network every so often. I think somewhat related to making a PPTP connection. This reset crashes my client server app.I upgraded this from a linksys vp41 - why I now question. that is a very low cost VPN router that actually works. Whatever you do - do not waste your time with this product. I wish I had not.
1,No longer useful,The required entries changed after this book was written. The reader has no way of knowing what information in this book is still reliable.
1,Disappointed,"Well, I'm disappointed with the ""Larry King Interviews"" dvds. I've only watched part of the first disc, which is the one with entertainers, but disappointed with the presentation.The quality is great, but there is no scene selection or scene guide to any of the interviews, mainly because there are no complete full interviews with any of the people he talks to. Just a hodgepodge of clips with the celebrities talking about whatever the subject is that he introduces (relationships, success, etc).I'm sorry I bought this, I should have stayed with my original plan to rent it.Oh well, that's the way it goes."
1,Very Disappointing,"The gameplay is excrutiatingly slow and the graphics get choppy if you get Spyro to run. All in all, compared to the other Spyro Playstation platform games, this is a joke. Any visual improvements are lost in the sloppy design and game flow.Bring back Insomniac!"
1,Blade is way too dull,"Sorry, this isn't a reasonable alternative to a commercial mandoline. I just got mine and tried it out on two foods.1. An orange (unpeeled, exactly as depicted on the box): A total and complete disaster. Couldn't even get it started on the end slice, so I cut it to the flesh first with a knife to get it going. I did not get a single clean slice. By halfway through the orange, it was a pulpy lump of mush.2. A sweet potato: I would rate this one perhaps a ""fair"" for slices. When I switched to the thick julienne blade, however, it would not cut completely through the entire width of the sweet potato. It jammed, leaving me with a mess.As a review above noted, it would completely impossible to cut a tomato on this thing. I have doubts about a bell pepper, too, as those have a skin.These blades don't cut it (pun intended). I'm returning it and buying a commercial model. Serious cooks should avoid this slicer."
1,This is not the real thing,"First of all this stuff is Cinnamon Leaf Oil and NOT Cinnamon Bark Oil. Olive nation is misleading people by not making it clear that this is Cinnamon leaf Oil. Even the label on the bottle they sent is different to the one on Amazon. Don't get me wrong,this stuff is Potent and will burn your hands if you are not carefull but it has no smell. And what is point of it if you don't get that classic Cinnamon scent? Only Cinnamon Bark oil will give you that. Compared to Cinnamon Bark Oil you can't smell this stuff. I wanted this stuff for my house, after seing them used in hotel in Sri Lanka (where the best Cinnamon Oil comes from)but I might as well throw it."
1,Secrets to a successful greenhouse business,"The book i ordered was 18 yrs old and not up to date. Plus, i was over charged for a book that costs $19.95 on the back of the book and i was charged $29.95 plus s&h of $10.00. I won't buy from amazon.com ever again."
1,Apathetic,"I didn't really care about the characters nor the love story. The implied passion was just that, more implied than revealed through the actions of the characters. I was excited when I picked this book and disappointed when I finished it because my expectations were high. Maybe too high.Do not read the introduction which spoils the conclusion of the novel. Just a heads up."
1,p 434,"My first Stephenson book, and maybe my last. I was interested to read other reviews that indicated that this book was not reflective of his talent. I certainly hope not.The book was overwritten and boring. At page 434, I had invested some time but I just could not care what happens to these boring people in their mechanical lives. Where's the story, I kept on thinking to myself, this will get better, there is so much potential here. I can't help but feel that if he edited the book down to 434 pages, it could have been a great story."
1,didn't work,This product did not help. I was still very allergic to the Schnauzer and had to find him a new home.
1,Save Your Money,"This might be of some to someone who could not print out the manual that ships with Reason. Otherwise, it simply is a lazy rewording of the manual - a functional description of the components.Whereas the manual might say, ""such-and-such a knob does so-and-so"" this book says ""such-and-such a knob does so-and-so, turn the knob and play a note, see what happens."" Well duh.Part of what makes it come to over 300 pages is its wide margins printed over with a gratuitous graphic of a level indicator. Reminds me of a kid's book report they try to fluff out to make extra pages.You'd do much better to play around with the turorials that ship with Reason, and visit Propellerhead's website for some real tips, tricks and insights into stuff not covered in this quick and dirty little pamphlet."
1,Overcharged!,"The company/person who sold this product to me made a major mistake that caused me to lose ALL respect for them. While the product was beautiful and in great condition when it arrived, it also had a price tag on it. I paid $39.99 plus S&H; for a product maked $10.50. I purchased the product thinking I was buying something worth $40, but in reality I received something worth just over $10.Honestly, I cannot tell the difference between a $40 broach and a $10 broach... but I am very disappointed that the seller would quadruple the price of an item. I feel this was an unethical decision on their part.I hope in the future, this company does not try to rip off its customers. But if you feel you must... don't let them know you're doing it.Disappointed,Stephen Moffett"
1,A metaphor can only be taken so far....,"I was unable to finish this book, despite my determination to not let it beat me. But I was unsuccessful. What eventually did me in was the tedious overuse of the ""falcon"" metaphor, although that was only one straw of many that broke my back. I only managed to get to page 160, but by that point the whole ""falcon"" imagery had been beaten like the dead horse it was and I'd had enough. It was obvious and contrived anyway, and only a skillful writer could have taken a dud device like that and made it somewhat tolerable. This Lowell could not do. Throw in a slow-moving plot where nothing really happens (the pacing was agonizingly slow), a heroine straight from an embarrasingly high-scoring Mary Sue Litmus Test, a risible mysticism/curse, and a really unlikeable ""hero"", and you have a total dog of a book. Woof, man. Woof. Thank God I paid nothing for the copy I read."
1,ONE BIG WASTE OF MONEY!,"This is more of a guidebook to basic computers and navigating the net than a book whose title promises online trading strategies. Of this entire work, only section four, the sites, was of any consequence. Keyword = Basic. Frankly, this publication was a BIG disappointment."
1,"""The more books I sell the more money I make""","The following link is to the text of an interview Ed Klein did for his book promotion.http://mediamatters.org/items/200506240007He is eviscerated for his constant prevarications.On page 12 he claims she is frigid and/or a lesbian. But by page 22 she had a torrid affair with Vince Foster. So which is it? This book is so full of unsubstantiated rumors and out right lies the answer is obvious - neither.In other interviews, Mr. Klein has described himself as an author of popular non-fiction and has stated his goal is to sell books to make money.A cottage industry is springing up on the internet debunking his lies. This book is not worth your time unless your goal is to be an uninformed, rabid Hillary hater. You can do that with a lot less mental exertion by watching Fox News."
1,Worthless piece of software,"Wanted to give taxcut a try. I got the CD and installed it. Software needs online update. Online update was not available because the server was too busy. It would not even start without the update. The update also requires proxy setting change. It is too much hassle to use it. Doing tax is frustrated enough, using this software made it even worse. Do not buy it."
1,I only bought it for Hard Boiled,"I bought this game because it is the only way to get Hard Boiled on bluray, well the movie is TERRIBLY dubbed and you can not choose to use subs, there is no scene selection or anything.The game itself is fun for the first hour then its to repetitive."
1,What do you want?,"I have many different versions of ""the four seasons"" but after hearing on TV Il Giardino Armonico play it. I just had to buy the CD. So I had high expectations and was expecting to see the orchestra all the time. Enjoying the beautiful music and divine performance. But most of the time I just see Venice. That information was not clear when I bought the DVD. If you like to look at a tourist DVD about an overrated Italian city while listening to divine music, then this is maybe your choice. But if you expect to see a great orchestra perform the best classical piece of music, then you will be disappointed."
1,"This is a one song soundtrack, unfortunately.","Bryan Adams is good and the Mexican tunes are great, but let's be honest: this is a single not a soundtrack. The best song by far is the Mexican version of ""Have you ever..."", but it is a paltry two minutes long and clipped short at the end. Come on folks, what's the deal? Was the CD running out of space or something, or did Bryan A. not want to be upstaged? I was very disappointed and cannot recommend this soundtrack/single!"
1,Sideways : DO I live on another planet than the rest of you?,"I cannot understand how anyone thought this was a good film. The characters were completely unlikable, the plot was empty. And oh my gosh, this movie was so void of any character I am just going to end this review now, cause I just don't care enough..."
1,How to sum up trash with three words,"Why is this man so popular? Why do people convince themselves that Omar Tyree can actually write? It's a little harsh to say he can't write at all when this is the only attempt I ever made at reading his work, but come on! I may not be a writer myself but I am a reader and I know trash when I see it. This book went absolutely nowhere. I only made it past the halfway point because my friend assured me it would be worth it to see how the story ended. The joke was on her because I got rid of the book and still found out the ending from a reliable source. Allow me to say I'm glad I didn't waste anymore of my time."
1,Where did the video go?,"This VHS video was sent to me in April 2002 and it never arrived. Perhaps it was unwise to order it because there was a possibility that due to system differences in the US and in Europe I may not have been able to view the contents in any case. But now, it wasn't even possible to try it out! So, I can provide no ranking with the stars, and will stick to just one (but not because I think it bad, I just haven't been able to view it)."
1,not KJ's fault - just bad writers,I rented this video because i'm a huge fan of Kevin James and was anxious to see if he is just as funny in this movie as he is in his hilarious King of Queens series. Not so. What a shame. The producers of Hitch should have hired the King of Queen writers; then they would have had a great comedy hit!
1,don't buy,"This is a piece of junk, does not work. Air comes out but makes a feeble, anemic noise that doesn't even phase my cat. Not worth the shipping to send back. Go to Wal-Mart and get one that works."
1,Color is black,"By looking at pictures, I thought these stands had a red tint to them. But the a purely black, which is not noted in description. The other thing not noted is that there is some assembly required. Usually not a big deal and there aren't too many parts. BUT in this case the holes don't line up well (yes I'm assembling correctly). So assembly has become rather difficult and has lead to some scratches. It's a fairly nice looking stand, but with the experience I've had, I would've shopped further. Note that there are several sellers of this item on Amazon, I unfortunately chose the most expensive of the two (noticed this later of course)."
1,Too complex.,I returned this item within 48 hours of receiving it because I found it very difficult to use. It is not intuitive and requires many hours of reading the manual and trying to apply what it says. I have worked in the IT arena for more than 25 years and do not tolerate IT products that cannot be easily understood and put to use right out of the box. This is one of those hard-to-use products.
1,Cheaply made,"The plastic fastener to the SUV rear gate latch snapped off when my 110 pound dog started to walk down. She sprained her knee.So I replaced the cheaply made nylon strap with the broken fastener with a stronger, thicker nylon strap and a metal fastener.I suggest the manufacture do the same."
1,A Disappointing Lack of Mature Artistry,"Two stars are awarded for the three most listenable trackson the disc (Sweet Escape, 4 in the Morning, Early WInter).The rest is immature, non-melodic, syntho-pop/rap garbage.This is not a mature album, nor is it much of a stretch for GwenStefani, who, now being a 35 year-old mother of two, can't seemto harness the power or maturity of her chronological age andapply it to her work as an ""artist."" Note to Gwen: the bubblegumrap/pop/syntho gunk about boyfriends and cell phones that youradoring 12-18 year fan base swoons over isn't broad or appealingenough to keep you singing much longer. This stuff ain't gonna flywhen your 40, girrrrrl. Find a new way to represent."
1,Didn't work with Blackberry's!!,This item isn't powerful enough to charge a blackberry. Always had a display message basically stating that it was under powered.
1,Is this even applicable in real life?,Are these puzzles even applicable in any real-life situation? It seems that instead of training the mind to think rationally they are training one to make any contextless connections.
1,"Iain's worst by far, I think...","Iain went too far with this book. If you read this, it's good at first (especially with the Lt.'s introduction killing Half-Caste) but when you keep going it gets horribly one-toned.Too many scenes are ruined by its consistently bleak nature. Abel always seems to be the underdog; the loser. When he gets his moment, he ruins it again and the story gets worse and worse. Way too much angst and way too much extremities simply adds up to a bad novel.It's too bad really, because it makes an excellent first impression. However, it has too many flaws as a novel so overall I wouldn't reccomend it to anyone."
1,Great hooks but not for outside use,"I bought these hooks to hang grilling tools on my BBQ grill.The magnets are great... very strongUnfortunately in less than a week the hooks began rusting.I suspect they will soon become, weeping, rusting attachments to my grill.Too bad. I'd have paid double to have them stainless, non rusting versions."
1,I'll make this short but brief.,"1) There is no Irish Pagan tradition called Witta--at least to the best of my knowledge as an Irish Pagan commonly living in Ireland and being a scholar of Irish history.2) Even if the tradition did exist, it most certainly would not be called Witta in the mother tongue. Why? Because the opening W is unpronounceable, that's why!3) This whole book is just a knock off of all the Wicca 101 books out there trying to pass itself off as something unique.4) Llewellyn gives me the shudders. Do they not have editors? Do they not have standards?5) For tha real scoop on Irish Witchcraft, try looking up and contacting any one of the many Irish covens on the Web."
1,Horrible,"And not in an acceptable sense of the word!They took an excellent ghost story and tried to do something with it.The problem is that they relied way way way too heavily on special effects. Don't believe me? Watch the original. It will have your skin crawling and had very little special effects.Why do they have to try to rework something that is perfect? I don't get it.If Hollywood is going to rework a masterpiece, then play it straight. Just because you can do all sorts of things with special effects doesn't mean you have to try to put them in remakes, especially if the original is perfect!"
1,"Great for 4 months, but then...","I've had these for 4 months and have enjoyed them until now. The wires are broken/loose and not working. There is another review with a similar problem at 4.5 months. Not a long lasting product, even with gentle usage."
1,confusing; wouldn't recomend it,"It showed the, definetly, unrealistic life of a boy in a weird world that was confusing."
1,Broke within 6 months,Just wanted to put my 2 cents in and let folks know that this machine just stops working for no reason. Sad cause it was great while it lasted....
1,I'm in Afghanistan,"I'm serving right now in Afghanistan, and you know what? I think when I retire from the army I'll go around trying to get free stuff from people by saying ""I fought for this country, how dare you!"" , sorry folks but it's pathetic to blame someone who faught in the war but later protested it, it's even more cowardly to use your veteran status to initiate more war. I fail to see how Kerry is to blame because some disturbed NVA/Vietcong jailers tortured people. Are you saying that if there were no protesters they would have been treated well? Get real! Later, I need to do some heroics so that I can get free stuff by spewing out how ""I faught for this country"" and everyone else owes me now."
1,"Great Sound, Unbelievably Uncomfortable","I bought these in the hopes that they would replace my inexpensive Philips HS500 Behind-The-Ear Headphones. The sound quality was better than the Philips but I can't wear them for more than 30 minutes at a time. I can wear the HS500's for hours on end and no discomfort.Though the sound is great, if you can't wear them, what good are they!I'll gladly stay with my HS500, which are now extremely inexpensive..."
1,Cheap plastic,I threw it away when it came and found one that was metal.instead .the plastic strips to easy and can't clamp down as well as I enjoy to do for nice sharp cuts.
1,Size does matter...,Not impressed with the size. Very shallow. I would return this this if I would have purchased this at a bick and morter store. Very cheap quality for farberware. You can do better just as well as buying one from wal-mart.
1,Is it supposed to be funny?,"Like a lot of other reviewers, this movie seems torn. The Coen brothers seemed to want to make a funny movie. There are some moments clearly designed to be funny. The movie has a lot of odd and absurd moments. Despite that, it isn't really a comedy. At times, it seems restrained in its humor, at other times the humor seems jarringly out of place. It's almost as if the Coen brothers' absurd style of humor and A-list actors like Clooney and Zeta-Jones just didn't mix. In the end, the film is just lifeless - except for Catherine Zeta-Jones, who looks gorgeous as always."
1,Works great for about a month,"I purchased one of these last spring and it worked great for about a month, then the daylight sensor failed. I returned the unit for replacment under warranty (shipping, $35.00, at my expense). some time late in the fall a replacment unit arived.This spring I put the replacement unit out in the garden, and it worked for about two weeks. Now the power light is on, but the UV bulb is not lighting and there is no power on the grid.I called KAZ Canada and all they can offer is another exchange under warranty with the shipping at my expense again. it seems to me that the problem is with their product, therefore they should cover the cost of shipping the defective product back.I am disappointed with the quality of the product and the poor service from KAZ.I wish I had read on-line reviews before purchasing this lamp."
1,Defective item,Good afternoon ... how is possible that companies such as Amazon and Levis sell and send defective items without going through a quality control. One pair of pants that I purchased came with one sleeve shorter than the other. How may be possible coming from you? What can I do with this piece of rag?
1,This movie Stinks.....,This movie Stinks Because It really wasn't that interesting. There wasn't much that excitement in there. All there was Was Bloodsucking and Vampires an Everything.
1,"Dubious factual content, not particularly useful","Earl Mindell has written several books on herbs and herbal remedies, unfortunately this latest contribution shares many of their faults. The authors do not specify which portion of the plant is used for many remedies and very little research is presented to support their use. Through out the book I had the sinking feeling that there had not been enough thought given to how dog physiology differs from human physiology. The skeptical reader may want to check out the quackwatch website for more information on Mr. Mindell's other books."
1,Navman iCN 5xx,"I have a similar iCN 510 unit. Came with 12 month warranty. 13th month the internal rechargeable battery died!!!. Can only run on external power, so every time it loses power i.e. stop for gas, loses all info and settings, and reboots when external power returns. Navman USA customer support rep said they have had ""some problems"" like this. Since it is out of warranty the cost is $109 plus $8.50 shipping. And for that total $117.50 charge you get a refurbished unit with a 90 day warranty!!! I will never buy Navman products again, how about you??? Good luck if you do."
1,Needed Deep Editing.Big waste of Talent Gaping Plot holes,"my summary basically says it all This movie was a bore and they could have cut an hour off this movie. if you want to see a movie about the planet being in jeopardy get Armageddon. Its priced better, a lot of fun and won't put you to sleep like this movie does."
1,IT's alright,"This montior does work well. I can hear my son breathing, and dogs barking and all of that very clearly. It works outside, upstairs and down. The problem is that I am spending a small fortune in batteries. When you plug it in it gets all fuzzy and has this terrible buzzing sound. I have tried both monitors and all the plugs in the house. So I have to replace the battery every day to use it through the whole night and that gets pretty expensive."
1,Christmas disappointment,I bought this cd as a Christmas gift and think it is terrible. It does not even sound like reggae music. I was so disappointed.
1,More of the same nothing new,"More of the same sex talk. Not much new data. The pictures where cool, but not what I expected in general."
1,Save your money.,"I am a Fordham alumnus (FCO '70). If the accuracy of Mr. Schroth's account of William Arnone is any indication of the degree of accuracy in the rest of the book, then I would say that Mr. Schroth has authored a most interesting work. . . of fiction!"
1,Beware,"This book should be purchased by music readers only -- not tablature readers. Of all the songs listed, only Stairway contains both music and tablature.Don't make the same mistake I did."
1,Please send me a new one,"I just opened my mail and found that this cover was in it. Hopeful to give it to my daughter for Christmas, I opened the outer envelope and found that the case has a terrible crack in it. This should be shipped in a carton or something other than a plastic bag. I hope they send me a new one or refund me completely."
1,Tea Box,Not too happy with this product. I gave it to someone for a present and when they opened it the hinges were stripped and falling off. Very disappointed in the quality. Wished I had not ordered it so early so I could have returned it.
2,"Excellent, but pricey","This is a very good, very carefully researched, and a must-read for anyone who ever even wondered about the history of Unix.However, I can't get over the price -- like US$30 for a pretty thin little book that's simply a for-fun read."
2,"Visually stimulating, not very educational","I absolutely enjoyed this video with my tiny child. It's visually stimulating, vibrant, fast paced and melodious! The only disappointment in this video is that it shows you images of fruits, animals, etc... but there are no words to read or a voice telling the child what it is that they are seeing.I always sit through this less than 25 minute video with my baby and I point out and described these things so that she can not only enjoy watching, but actually learn something at the same time. And we get to bond a little too. Sometimes, she actually moves me out of the way! She just likes to [watch] sometimes too."
2,Beautiful Romance,"If you like romance novels or films, you'll love this movie. It's romantic, funny, and realistic, without being disappointing. It's beautifully acted, too."
2,I have read my friends copy of the book and I want to buy it,"I am Italian-American. I was born in USA but grew up in Italy and I am very familiar with all the facts that the author writes about. I am pretty confident that he has been telling us many true stories. Although Andreotti was found not guilty during last winter trial I have my own stories about want happen during his half-a-century role in the Italian Post War history that confirms the author's views. I am married to a Sicilian and I have many interesting episodes my in-laws told me about the Lima brothers and Andreotti. The author is good in making the reader understand how Sicily could have been a Paradise to live but instead it is a only a place to visit. This all because of the Mafia and corruption that marked the history of this island. Few men, Falcone, Borsellino, Della Chiesa tried really to change things but they were killed and today every time I visit Sicily I can tell you things have not changed."
2,I thought it was a great read,as this story was partly about some of my ancestors which I had no knowledge of before had I thought it was great
2,A Program on the CD solved my problem.,"I've tried to use the internet as it was intended, a free and open system where I could surf, send e-mails to friends and business associates, and generally tried to be a good internet citizen. Why is it then that about 60% of the e-mail I receive is trying to sell me investments, medicine, a phony degree, or enlargement of certain body parts, some of which I don't even have.The answer, of course, is that it's free to send out e-mails in any quantity to any list of addresses. What I don't understand is why the congress has allowed it to continue, but they do.The answer is that you have to be prepared to defend yourself from these unwanted intrusions. I thought I was doing pretty well, until a particularly nasty adware program managed to get into and install itself in my system. One of the packages included on the CD in this book solved the problem, that alone made the book worth its price."
2,die hard collection,"Die hard is a great movie it arrived really fast and i bought it at a great price.Thank You,"
2,my 2 and 3 yrs old kids watched it over and over,"Helloim french , my husband is american when we were in states (for holidays)i was attracted by the title and the trailer on her other dvd..we tried it and big success. they watch over and over and my daughter started (3) to write letters or sign them with her body... amazed thank blues clues.so i bought 2 more dvd."
2,Loved the product,"I bought this guitar strap for my teenage son, who loved it.It was exactly what he wanted."
2,Excellent & essential,"Top notch material, revved up 3 chord R&R; and a few smooth ballads. Good quality mastering (probably from vinyl but sounds very good), although some of the song beginnings are clipped off and are on the previous song file. Perhaps this is fixed on the 2003 version..? I hadn't heard much about Gene until someone sent a MP3, and I got the full CD. How he isn't up there with Gene, Eddie & Buddy I really don't know! Added many tracks to my oldies station, excellent stuff!Shawn[...]"
2,Addictive!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I love this show! Superb acting. It makes me wish I had a crisis management team that I could call on. Kerry Washington is a great actor. The series is addictive. You will love the show after the first five minutes. They pull you in, and it's a wrap. Thank you Shonda Rhimes for another excellent well written drama. It will leave you on the edge of your seat."
2,Don't know if it was good or bad but couldn't stop.,"You can read the rest of the reviews for a discussion of theplot, characters, etc., but the way I read it best describesit. I used it as a soporific at night, and eventually got tothe point where like an addictive sleeping pill, I couldn'tskip a night without tossing and turning. I have eighty pagesto go, and I'm beginning to worry about what will happenwhen I have to go cold turkey. Maybe like an earlier reviwer,I'll have to maintain the addiction and read it again, lookingfor the seeds and stems."
2,"""I LOVE you Nick and you love me!!!""","This was a favorite movie of mine when I was in middle/high school. I saw it in a bargain bin last Christmas season, and picked it up. It wasn't as thrilling as I remembered, but it was still pretty good. Beautiful, brillant, rich, charming, and a psychopath sets her eyes on the renter of her parents guest home. She's one that never hears the world no. Okay, some of the plot, especially at the end is really far fetched, but besides that, it's a movie I can still enjoy."
2,Good Fan Not Great,I received this a day before estimated which made me extremely happy I hate waiting. The fan is good it clips on securely to almost anything. It's really quiet which I liked too. The only thing I wish is that the fan had more power. it moves a good amount of air for the price but would have liked some more air movement on high.
2,Awesome info!,"I highly recommend reading Twist of the Wrist for any rider. It will help new riders understand the physics of how the bike works in turn dismissing some of the common fears associated with riding. It will also help more experienced riders become better in corners, thereby improving time and safety. I also recommend supplementing the read with watching videos on cornering techniques as it helps cement the ideas."
2,A teen guide that works both for teens and for their parents,"Author Laurie Orloff wrote a book that lets everyonesit around the table in new seats. Teens will nodtheir heads and parents will nod their heads, andall of this will add up to building a warm, caring, often humorous understanding of what's going on. Perfect for teens and their parents -- and anybody curious about what's around the bend."
2,In the Tradition of...,"In the tradition of Patrick O'Briens characters, Jack Aubrey and Stephen Maturin; and Forester's Hornblower; plus the beginnings of ""Riley Ace of Spies"", based on ""British Agent"" by R.H. Bruce Lockhart. Childers book was recommended to me by Mick Mallon, who I hope would not mind me describing him as a linguist, sailor, reader and reviewer of books. When, in 1975 at home in the Canadian Arctic, I said I enjoyed spy novels he passed on Childers book. The softback has stayed with me since then, the hardcover goes to my grandchildren."
2,Tom Robbins,Tom Robbins writes with purpose and fun. I read all his books. They're zany and educating. I would love to meet him.
2,Terrific film,"Never heard of this, happened on it. What fun! What a surprise! It is a sheer delight, if you don't mind having fun, laughing, seeing good acting, not slapstick but still in your face in a delicious way at times, go rent/buy this one! Enjoy! (realize this is not a profound critical review and really don't care, it was fun, great time, seen this twice and I'll see it again, purchased some dvds for some friends who are wanting some more laughs in their lives)"
2,Strong Bonds of Friendships,"The Savings Graces: Emma, Rudy, Isabell and Lee. Four women who have formed a strong friendship and rely on each other for strength. A much need strength for the challenges they are facing. Emma in love with a married man. Rudy controlled by her possessive husband. Lee desperately trying to conceive a child. And Isabelle battling breast cancer.The women learn that no matter what curve ball life throws them, their true friends will see them through it.Each character becomes more alive and real to the reader through the author's brilliant writing style of devoting each chapter to one Graces."
2,Fave christmas movie!,"I watch this movie every year - it puts me right in the spirit of Christmas....pain, grief, awkwardness, yearning for what you can't have and yes, love, actually. It will make you sad, cry, angry, laugh...it will make you feel, actually.This film is well written and beautifully acted by many name-brand actors. Spend a little cash and give yourself this present, to be enjoyed for years to come :)"
2,Deserves Six Stars,"If I could give this product six stars, I would. The engineering and quality for the price, is outstanding."
2,My son does not like it..,"My yougn son has no interest in the book at all. My older one does because he can read it himself, but my 2 year old wants nothing to do with it. I believe it's because the pictures are out of focus, and not very pretty looking. Some bright, bold, close up shots of babies nursing would be better.Any other time my little guy see's a picture of a breastfeeding he points to it, and says 'Baby eat'. Not with this book though.A face lift is needed before I'll give it anymore stars."
2,Junky switch + Great light = One Heck of a Problem,It's true (as many before me have said) that the switch is pure hell. Flickering everytime I turn it on. Sometimes the light seems very dim until I mess with the switch and realize it's just not 'contacting' well.The problem is I LOVE the light. I'm too stupid and cheap to throw it away. So I continue on and suffer every night (since I usually use it as a reading light).Go ahead and buy it. It's nice. It's blue and the light it great. But you've been warned about that darn switch...
2,great stand out color,"Littmann cardiology, always the gold standard for the cardiac nurse. Love the stethescope and love the color. Would definately recommend to a friend"
2,Excellent translation for our next president,"I'd already read this extraordinary book in the original English edition and decided to check the Spanish one (sometimes they do terrible Spanish translations). Fortunately, this translated version captures perfectly the spirit and scope of Mr. Richardson's vision of America, and his wonderful history of achievements, all put in such excellent Spanish it feels as if one was reading the original work. I hope this inspiring story will help many Hispanic citizens know better a man highly qualified to guide the USA during the 2008-2011 presidential term."
2,A treasure for Stooge fans!,"This collection of short subject films and clips featuring pre-Columbia Stooges is a valueable piece of Sttooge history. We get to see the Stooges with Ted Healy, their co-founder and straight man. What makes this video interesting is that we get to see the origins of many of the Stooges' routines with lines delivered differently than expected. Bear in mind, this isn't the hardcore slapstick that became the boys' trademark ; it's watered down with song and dance segments, but for the true Stooge fan this is a terrific historical document."
2,"Inteligent, funny and moving.","This is my favourite movie of year 2000. Jack Black is histerical as Barry, and Todd Louiso, playing the same character he did in Jerry Maguire -except here he is not a nanny here, or child technician, as he described the job- is great, and the rest of the cast does a wonderful job. Just wanted to say it is a great move, don't feel like reviewing. Watch it, you will like it, unless you are bitter and numb."
2,Best of the Midkemia/Serpent War Saga,"Like a lot of ""Final"" books in a series. There are so many loose ends to bring to conclusion; however Mr Feist does an extremely good of doing this. Without getting boring. This a book that will be read straight thru, as the action seldom falters from cover to cover. It does however, leave openings for further books which gives us Midkemia fans hope for a new saga."
2,Love It!,We purchase the boots and the Fireman outfit for Halloween. My 2 year old loved it! We had Firemen telling us it looked like the real thing. My son wears them all the time!
2,Oscillating Table Fan from Amazon,The fan works well and is very quiet. I like having 3 choices of speed too. I found it hard to put the fan together and had to have help doing it. It is all plastic. I prefer metal but that is just a preference of mine. I think you will enjoy using it.
2,Old fashioned British,"Great old fashioned British humor. Great to watch this kind of straight forward comedy, no crudity, no swearing, amazing."
2,This Is AWSOME,I love this movie! I words to to ALL the songs and i love this movie. They did a realy good job on casting! I can't what for High School Musical 2!!!!! You should by this movie and by the CD cause there AWSOME!!!!
2,"Tasty and economical, wish it was lower sodium","I used to use the organic vegetable broth cartons but was looking for a lower sodium alternative. Sodium is better then what I had been using, not ideal, and I like the flavor. Tends to clump a little. The cost is much better, especially on Subsribe and Save. I like not wasting all those cartons which were not recyclable, as far as I know. Product was shipped promptly as usual. Not sure if it really has MSG or not as some of the reviews suggested."
2,ANOTHER MOZART MASTERPIECE OF FUN & FOLLY...,"With the wonderful voices of such outstanding performers that we are so fortunate to be able to enjoy, this ear pleasing music is enhanced with the visual treats of the DVD... It's like owning your own opera house without having to leave your armchair..."
2,Great replacement for my mixer's original wire whip,"I've had my KitchenAid mixer for at least 10 years now, and the original whip had deformed enough so that it would make contact with the mixing bowl during operation. Found the replacement here on Amazon, and for the price, it's like getting a brand new mixer again. Fits perfectly and works exactly as the original, although as one reviewer notes, it does come with a prominent ""Hand Wash Only"" tag attached whereas the original had no trouble going in the dishwasher. Still, if I had known these were available at such a low price, I would have bought a replacement a long time ago.Want to also congratulate KitchenAid and Amazon on the ""frustration free packaging"". The item arrives in a KitchenAid cardboard box. Open it, and there's your part - no silly human-proof plastic to cut through. Bravo!"
2,Would Have Loved to Make the Actual Trip,"I enjoyed Mary's story VERY much. I was surprised to learn she had been a book editor because I was distracted in the beginning chapters by many sentence fragments and run-on ""sentences"". I learned it was bad form, if not poor grammar to begin a sentence with the word ""And"". I was also confused at some points while trying to follow the story line: Mary skipped the family Thanksgiving for a warm weather trip South...but later in the story, she claims to have visited her aging grandmother in upstate New York over that same Thanksgiving? Maybe I'm reading too literally. I greatly admire her spirit of adventure and her courage in sharing her emotional life with us. I'm left wondering, though: what if Lars had invited her to sail to Europe? Would she have accepted that challenge/invitation?"
2,You keep wondering,"There are so many books about the end of days. While reading Last Night you keep wondering what it would be like living without engines, electricity, running water and especially without communication. No news, no internet, no TV, no radio. There are disaster issues from the government in our country that warn us to keep food and water for four days in our homes. But what about day 5... I keep thinking that in our western society the consequences of a disaster like this are underestimated in this book."
2,Natural sound,The Grado RS1 is a reference for listening to classic music. In comparison to the AKG K701 (which is another reference headphone) the Grado sounds with more precise and intense sound (nearly brutally natural). The Akg K701 in comparison with the Grado sounds more soft and less stunning.
2,Great Looking Phone,"This phone is great looking, easy to use and has the email functionality that you would expect from RIM-blackberry. I love the fact that is tiny and lighweight. Although I've heard some people complain about how difficult it is to type on the keypad, I (6'3'' with giant hands) haven't had a problem with that thus far. I think that people are expecting the best of both worlds- a tiny phone with a giant key board(get a speak and type program). That said, I do have one problem with this otherwise wonderful phone (although I gave it a five star rating). I think that the RIM folks could have added video capture capacity and a better camera this beauty. Other than that though, this small lightweight smart phone is everyones dream-UNLESS YOU LIKE BULKY CELL PHONES ATTACHED TO YOUR HIP!"
2,Great Portable Microphone!!!!,The clarity of this microphone is amazing. It is easy to setup and works well on the road. I would recommend to a friend.
2,A Nice Christmas with Reddy,"It is so good to hear Helen Reddy singing Christmas carols, and so well. Her voice is missed from radio at Christmas and any other time of year."
2,Non Stop Pleasure,"Oooh Boy, oooooh Boy. I have never known Professor Harris, but I can imagine the kind of gentlemen he would be. This book is a distilled NON STOP pleasure. Every little sentence, and I mean, Literally every little sentence, will get to the sweet spot, and tickle you again again, until you have spent the whole of yourself, and are wondering, what , what exactly is there after ecstasy. I am a radio engineer, since the last 20 years, but have spent almost half a decade, building line modems for a living. This book, with every word, hits me in the right spots, but then, this kind of background is a little clumsy. Nonetheless, I suspect if you are a communication engineer and a little into wireless this guy is going to get groans out of you !!!!!!"
2,"Seems to work as expected, but no real noticeable increase in speed...","The router works as expected with security features that my previous router didn't have. I am unable to determine if there was an increase in speed, but I am happy with the purchase."
2,video web sites need to have a list of song titles,I can't rate this video because I haven't seen it yet! I don't know the song titles because the web site does not show them. I ordered a cd from K.P.B.S. T.V. that had exactly the same title as the vhs video and none of the songs were the same I was dissappointed!
2,Welcome to the World,"Wonderful book. Story line keeps you involved. Characters were interesting,exciting, lively, neighbors next door. As well done as the other books by F.Flagg. Can't wait to read her next book!"
2,A MUST READ,There's nothing more satisfying than reading a book that doesn't leave your side...you want to read it as often as possible until that last page. And then it's all over...what a great novel.
2,Excellent Marketing Resource,"I was referred to this product through a contact at the American Marketing Association. What a great piece of advice!This is impressive software from every perspective. I found it easy to use, the content is excellent throughout, and the sample marketing plans were amazing. Check out ""Interior Views"" for example. The other resources, including the associated book, were also valuable for me.My marketing plans looks great and I would not have been able to accomplish this task so efficiently without this software."
2,Interesting and bone chilling,here is a book that everyone should read. the story telling is unique and the charcter is facinating. is trully smelltacular.
2,tae kwon do green belt to red belt,I having been in tae kwon do for about 2 yrs. am a beginner. I found that the step by step pictures and writtings were indispensible in learning my forms.
2,A must for a gravy boat,A must for a gravy boat a it prevents gravy from leaking on the table. It looks great with the boat
2,Great fun times!,"This little bugger is good! While I do wish he was a little more ""squirmy"" he's still VERY satisfying!With reversible directions and multiple levels of vibrations, this guy is awesome for hours of stimulating pleasure!"
2,Nice,"These are nice little happy pills. I think it helps, but I've only been taking it for a few weeks. I recommend it."
2,I very much recommend this book,"It's a fun, easy read and you get something out of it. I could totally relate to so many scenarios too, especially the one about being up at 3:00 in the moring and then the father/daughter part. Everyone should read this book."
2,Bicycle Under Seat Pouch,It attached very easily and gives me expandable room to store those small items that I would otherwise need to keep in my pockets! I now mainly use it for repair items for the bike!
2,A touching exploration of the soul,No Star Trek movie can really beat Star Trek IV but Star Trek V really moved me. I found the exploration in man's pain and search for what every man wants to find a fascinating exploration. I recommend this to anyone who has ever wondered whats at the center of the universe.
2,includes some selections that are unique to this project,"1986, Windham Hill WD-0700, currently out of print.Michael Hedges' musical score for a 1986 Rabbit Ears childrens video narrated by Kelly McGillis (Rabbit Ears Productions/Childrens Video Library catalog #5390). The score includes some selections that are unique to this project: track 2 (an instrumental version of ""Ready or Not""), and tracks 5 and 6.Michael Hedges: acoustic guitar, harp-guitar, acoustic bass guitar, flute1. Santabear's First Christmas (narration with music)2. Ready or Not (instrumental; vocal version appears on Live on the Double Planet)3. The Double Planet4. Eleven Small Cubs *5. Larry's Instrumental6. Carol Jean* ""Eleven Small Cubs"" is a re-recording of ""Eleven Small Roaches"" from Breakfast in the Field.Produced by Michael Hedges and Mark Sottnick.Recorded at Different Fur Recording, San Francisco, CA."
2,Worth every penny,"It may not be his best ever but when you hold it up to the dim light of what is being produced in music these days it shines very brightly, indeed. John avoids over-thinking and over-producing these clever and well thought-out songs. The guitar playing is excellent throughout, as usual. Overall, it's a good listen and easily one of his better efforts. One note, though. John, why not write a song protesting the ruthless terrorists?"
2,One of the best,"This a a great work of animation. Everyone is having a lot of fun and the artists are at their peak.The chairs dance, the radio joins in, and Mickey out-does Fred Astair, dancing on a top hat with a match for his cane.(The software that comes with this DVD did not work on our XP computer, but alternative software from the computer manufacturer should be fine.)"
2,"The best, most versatile commuter mug I've ever used",It fits in car cupholders. I can toss it in my briefcase and take it to work. It doesn't leak. It keeps my coffee hot. What more could you want?
2,Very good Family Movie,"This is one of the most uplifting movies that I have seen in a while. I do not know why it didn't show on the theaters. The story of bravery and journey of a little boy is filled with danger, adventure and choices that small people dont understand but it is reality.This movie is a great tool for a family discussion about honor, hardship, choices, friendships, trust, war, death, etc. It is a well made suspense movie that a kid can watch and still learn valuable lessons without becoming David. I'm keeping my dvd in my collection and glad that I found a little jewel to keep in my heart."
2,Eureka Solo Spitfire Tent,"I really like this tent although I do wish it was a bit more roomy. There is just enough room inside of it for me and some basic gear like a water bottle and a jacket. There is also enough room between the tent and the rain fly to keep your boots dry but out side of the tent. I am very happy with the weight and the bulk, well worth the reduced space. I plan to get the foot print for it because I noticed some water on the ground after the second or third night, although I suspect my camel back was leaking and this was not the tents fault. Very easy to set up by your self and pack into the sack. If you are looking for a relatively inexpensive solo tent and don't need to store gear in the tent with you this is the one to get."
2,Music,"This is a DVD that I really, really like. It has all of the people from the Gaither Band in the past and they are reunited with the gaither Vocal Band in the present and boy!!! do they bring together some great gospel singing... also, the new Vocal Band is viewed ( I love them) as well as Guy Penrod ( whom I miss terribly). This is a great DVD, I enjoy listening to it so much."
2,One of the Dead's best CDs,"Many highlights and nice tune selection overall, with better sound quality than most of the Dick's Picks CDs. The performance is from their peak era and mostly uptempo. Weaknesses are fairly limted: Pigpen's neanderthal yowlings, and an anemic rendition of Wharf Rat with missing chords and lyrics. There are exceptional jams/medleys on discs 3 and 4, among their best work ever published."
2,step garden kneeler,this also works good as a stool for our granddaughter to use for hand washing at the sink
2,Amazing CD - Takes a bit to get used to,"Eh, when I first heard this cd, I thought Our Lady Peace was just another mainstream pop rock band. I didn't like Theif (Thief?) too much, and many of the songs were corny and sounded too poppy for me on first listen. (This seems to be the case with most of the Our Lady Peace stuff I've listened to.) Thus, I never listened to the cd again (I listened to a friend's copy that time.)Later on however, another friend lent me the cd, and when I listened to it, I was blown away. The songs finally made sense to me and I thought, ""Wow, this cd is truly amazing."" This record has excellent tracks like ""One Man Army"", ""Theif"", ""Waited"", ""Stealing Babies"", heck all of the songs are great.Buy this cd if you can.Btw, for better songs by these great artists, check out ""Superman's Dead"", ""In Repair"", ""Naveed"", ""Whatever"" and ""Clumsy"". Avoid ""Somewhere Out There"" and the album ""Gravity"" at all costs."
2,Learning Experience,"Being born in 1970, I didn't grow up watching the nightly news regarding the war in Vietnam. This was very educational. It's an eye opener for sure. I think to a certain extent, the things that happened in Vietnam have been glossed over by the U.S., or misinterpreted by the public. This goes to show you how courageous our troops were and how they deserved much better than what they received upon arriving home."
2,"""I can't seem to forget her""","When I first met my sweetheart in 1976, Windsong was a very popular heavily advertized scent. My wife was using it when I first met her, and for 32 years, I still know where she is by the distinct scent that for everyone who knows her, (from her life long friends to her Kindergarteners) is my wife.I have tried several times over the years to buy her an expensive designer scent, but she never will wear them, because even she identifies herself with the scent.If they ever stop making this my world will never be the same.This is not a scent that works for everybody, but try it and see if Windsong can make you unforgetable."
2,Come and visit. The ghosts are waiting for you.,"Haunted Inns of New England is a fun book to read while you are lying in bed. Don't forget to keep a pen and note paper on your night table, just in case you want to visit one of these inns and need to write down their name. New England is a great place to visit. Not too big, not too crowded and not too expensive. It has many different types of attractions and Haunted Inns are just one of them. Don't forget the haunted pubs (sorry that's another book!) Come and visit. The ghosts are waiting for you."
2,this book is awsome,Where the Red Fern Grows is a very good book. A friend recomended it to me so I read it. It starts off with a man that sees something that reminds him of his past. And the book goes on telling his childhood story. It's a story about how the boy wants two little hound dogs and how he works to get them. The book tells how he trains his dogs to be very good hunters. He takes them on a lot of hunts. It also tells about the hunts that the boy and his dogs go on. I thought this was a very good book. I would recomend this book to anyone that likes hunting or dogs.
2,PWPalmer,We've had this unit about a month now and it works great. It heats the water quickly and the water gets very hot - so be aware. It is easy to fill with and pour water from. Great value.
2,Totally awesome and good,"I don't know how she does it, but Dr. Berry takes a story about ordinary people and try to teach us a lesson in the midst of it. I got this book yesterday, and I wish I could better describe it, but I will try. You have this middle age couple that was in a love rut, well the wife, Louella dreams up her dead female relatives one night, who tell her what to do in the love department, and chile, some of those love scenes in that book would probably rival some of Zane's stuff(which is racy)yet,to keep to the story, the couple gets out of the love rut, and come find out,they have the gift of knowing what is in people's minds, so much so, that they help, as well as frighten some of the townspeople into doing what is right.There were times that I had to put the book down and think on some of the things that was said because although it was fiction, it was if it was talking to me. At any rate, GET THIS BOOK!!!"
2,Chasing Bears,"I purchased this book to read to my 9 yr son while vactioning in Voyageurs National Park. On a rainy day I began reading it to my son out loud. Soon my husband and 12 year daughter came to listen. It became our evening ritual, reading several chapters out loud to the whole family. It is very well written and suspenseful. We hope he writes another book."
2,Jeff Dunham is a riot!!,"Probably the most talented ventriloquist of the times. He is hilarious, and skilled. The bonus footage was cool, too."
2,Fantastic for non-cooks who want BOTH healthy & delicious,"If you don't cook, it's a major investment of time that can be very unpredictable and a real let-down if it doesn't work out. This book removes the guess work and ensures the time is well-spent. Love it!"
2,Historical detail.,"If you enjoyed Defiance, this will add detail to what was portrayed in that film. It takes some polish off the hero image of the brothers, showing them to be rougher characters starting out than in the film. Ultimately their heroism does not suffer much by portraying them more realistically."
2,Great for the price,"I bought this wire stripper through Amazon and used it in converting my home's phone wiring to ethernet wiring. This is a handy little tool and works well. It's small enough for comfortable and easy one-hand use, and the dial to set the size of the wire you're stripping is simple and stays put once you set it. My only complaint is that the side-mounted spring can get in the way when trying to snip small wires, but this is not a problem if you just flip the tool around. Overall, a great purchase."
2,hilarious and heartwarming,"if you love will ferrell, you will love this movie. he's hilarious in it and its a great christmas movie to see with your family. I feel like the younger generation will laugh at will ferrell's weirdness and the older generation will enjoy the heartwarming message :) (or at least thats what happened with i watched it with my grandpa and mom)"
2,Fantastic!,"I thought this book was great. For somebody who likes to eat but doesn't like to cook, this book contains easy and yummy recipes that even I don't mind making. I always thought anything ""protein"" was boring but the author gives great ideas for seasoning and sauces that are no to low carb and delicious at the same time. He uses combinations of ingredients that one might think is strange...until you try it and love it!!! Also, his cooking techniques make meats moist, juicy and tender. These recipes make losing weight a fun and tasty experience. My family loves them too!"
2,Classic Renbourn,"I own every recording Renbourn has ever produced with his name on the main by-line, and he's never put out an unsatisfactory work. Even then, this is one of his best from his earlier years. It's an all solo-instrumental set with no vocals (though another truly exceptional guitarist, John James, sits in on several tracks as well), featuring both originally composed material and adapted works by O'Carolan and others. I like this particular album by Renbourn because his treatment of the material does not fall victim to his one occasional weakness as a guitarist: a tendency toward repetition. If you listened much to NPR's program ""All Things Considered"" in the 1970s and 1980s you will recognize one of the cuts from this album, which was used for many years as a filler sequence on that program."
2,Slight disappointment,"The weakest link in any booster cable is the clamps. If the connection from clamp to terminal is even slightly weak then the amperage is critically limited (even 1 ohm is too much at 12 volts). I chose these because of their fairly heavy gauge to maintain amperage despite their length, but (and you can't tell from the listing) the clamps are not as impressive as I would like -- they are the sort where there is copper on only one side of the jaws and I would prefer both. Most of us have had the experience of working clamps into corroded terminals to try to get just a bit more power. I haven't used these cables yet but assume confidently they will work fine. The cables are fairly flexible and appear sturdy and well-insulated. Don't skimp on cables, you get what you pay for, and I think these are merely a fair deal in light of their much higher price."
2,Actually pretty good.,"""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" I believe is one one of John Williams best scores. Unfortunately, it has been out of print for some time. This album contains excerpts from all three of the Indiana Jones films. They are not the original recordings but this is a good effort and actually is quite an enjoyable listen. I have gotten alot of enjoyment from this CD. If you enjoy the compositions of John Williams or are a fan of Indiana Jones as I am , I would recommend this very much."
2,Instant Vocabulary,"This little book is one of the best teaching aids I've ever come across and one of the best investments I've ever made in terms of lesson planning, not to mention my own knowledge. It groups the word affixes by meaning and derivation. I'm on my second copy. I used the first one until it literally fell apart in my hands.I'm only sorry it's not available in hard cover."
2,Zone Meals in Secons,"I have other books on the zone and I'd recommend them to anyone wanting to improve their health, lose weight or combat disease."
2,Brilliant (as always) !,"Sad to say, the 90's hasn't produced a ""band"" like EWF. Folks, this is what the ""total"" package is all about in music ... they write, they play, & they perform ! Nothing is lost in the transition from studio to stage. As far as this CD is concerned, it's another testament to the power of this group's music to transcend even ""popularity"" of the group. I was in my late teens & early twenties during EWF's heyday. But there is something to be said about the timeless quality of their music. Hip-hoppers & rappers, TAKE NOTES!"
2,Solid Bluetooth Headset,This headset has good sound quality - the best bluetooth I have owned. It generally makes up for the less than quality sound of my Blackberry phone - most people can hear me better than when talking directly on the phone. Rarely do I get any cutting out. I would buy it again. It also has a great price compared to most other well rated headsets.
2,Great Coffeemaker!!,"I like this coffeemaker ALOT!!My first one had develpoped an air bubble, that I treated for a couple of months (it was a good way to clean the coffeeepot also), it successfully went away for months (in fact, I was definitely sure it was gone for good,then it was back again)..., well, decided to get the one I have now!! It's now here at home, on standby, for when the other one acts up!! Even though I'm telling you the air-bubble problem..., I still like this coffeemaker, & will STAY with Krups coffeemakers!!William Appelt"
2,Keurig B-70 B70 Platinum Single-Cup Home Brewing System,"I love it. Started using it the day I received it and have used it every morning after. I like how fresh it tasts and is hot, every cup."
2,Not for short people,"The only reason i give it a four is because my wife is short,5'4"" when it comes to pour in the water.This maker makes a fine cup of coffee,takes a little getting used to,such as getting the rite amount and all the other comon scense things it takes to make a cup of good coffee.There are a few small things,the clock is small,the only reason it's on at all is for the time setting,finger prints,so what?,any appliance that uses a timer places you at the mercy of the manufacture,is it a quality timer that he puts into his product? At least the warranty was'nt written in small Chinese print at the bottom of the page,buy it,i think it's a good one."
2,Quality Product,These deflectors are well made and fit perfectly. Well worth the extra cost for a well-designed quality product. I recommend these deflectors over the cheap stick-on type.
2,Absolutely incredible...,"...but it will be absolute torture waiting for book four.This book, amazingly, was actually _better_ than the preceding two. Mr. Martin is without a doubt the most enrapturing fantasy writer I've ever had the privilege to read."
2,Awesome!,"Great delivery time! Very good book to help with all of those term papers whether you need APA or MLA writing styles. Up to date information on online resources, ect."
2,"All Killer, Some Filler","I am avid listener of Southern music and have to say that I would stack the first dozen tracks of this CD up against anything ever recorded at Stax or Muscle Shoals or Philly International. Duke borrowed her stage name from the tobacco heiress, figuring it might help her career, and went into the studio with Swamp Dogg to create some serious alchemy. The covers towards the end of the CD are victimized by poor arrangements (ex ""By the Time I Get to Phoenix"" is tough on the ears) but the stuff from her first album and side 1 of her second effort are top-shelf.Hopefully someone will reissue Swamp Dogg's ""Total Destruction to Your Mind"" for another blast of Deep Soul."
2,Sounds more like Dylan than Dylan,"This guy has a Dylan sound. This one is kind of a lo-fi production -- raw and energetic. If you like folk rock mixed with political speech, this guy is for you."
2,New Fan,This one got me hooked on the whole concept. Loved the acting and the story lines. It's one of those series you wish would go on forever.
2,McDougall and Ornish people- great book!,"After almost a year on Dean Ornish's program to reverse heart disease, I had wonderful results, but got pretty tired of the recipes. McDougall has some offerings (same health program), but this book has wonderful recipes and lots of information for those of us who need it.It must be easy for vegans and vegetarians to find their way through meat free recipes, but many of us are unfamiliar with this lifestyle and have to it abruptly by heart disease or cancer. We DON'T know the things that seem obvious to long term vegetarians.This book was a Godsend for my heart disease support group. Thank you so very much."
2,fun card games,Has many fun card games and the characters add to the realism. A nice touch is being able to create your own character.
2,Hot & Bothered is an Understatement!! A Must Read!!,"If you have not read any of Janelle Denison's work, then you are really missing out on superb writing! Ms. Denison has a way of writing that not only catches your interest, but gives you a chance to know the characters on a one-on-one basis. Erica is a radio talk show host who talks about sex but never experienced the real deal till she meets her on-the-phone-discussion-pal, Ian. When these two actually meet, you can actually feel the sparks! The love scenes are sensual and erotic; a definite must read! This in one of those books that once you begin to read, it's hard to put down. Definitely a 5-star vote in my book!"
2,amazing product,"It's rare that I write a review, saving them for products that really stand out, either bad or good. In this case, the MenScience face scrub is amazing. I followed the directions, rubbing it in for a minute or two. Then I use a moisturizer afterwards. My skin looks and feels great.. very clean and healthy looking. I've only used it a few times now, but this scrub really works. I would recommend to anyone."
2,a great actress or a grand duchess?,"The first 20 pages of Anastasia: The Riddle of Anna Andersen are very interesting and make you want to keep reading. But Kurth is obiviously on a follower of Anna because instead of writing a true non-fiction (instead of stating facts) he has to find situations that prove Anna Andersen is Anastasia; expecially in the first trial chapter where he stresses that the judge was being unfair; which made him sound like a child whining (but, but. . .) Even with these small annoyances, the book was very enjoyable altogether."
2,Into Thin Air,"I enjoyed this book very much. It does have some language in it but other than that, it was really good. It doesn't hold up to Into the Wild, which is awesome, but Jon Krakauer is a great writer and I recommend this book for anyone who enjoys reading, nature, and being outside."
2,Nas is Still Here to stay,"Imma make this short, Nas is still and will forever be on point. Every single song has a story to it and you'll always walk away with something enlighting in every track. Keep bringing the heat Nas."
2,Looking for the Doom Tree Series on DVD,"... My favorite character, by the way, is Rini. She's just so kute!!! She and Helios make such a kute couple! Too bad he was a dream love and he couldn't be with her in person always and forever..."
2,Helped a lot,"I have two rescue dogs who are great in many ways, but pull quite a bit on the leash.This helped me train them a lot and they are now a joy to walk."
2,I'm in WOW bata :),"I don't know about the min requermint, but I can tell you my pc's config, I have a P4 2.4, 512RAM, Geforce 5200 128MB<br />the installer is about 2.4GB, it took me half an hour to install, so it's big. I think I might need a better video card, coz in 1024x768 I only can use the lower setting. <br />I'm night elf hunter, LVL 10, now I can tamp beast now :D<br />the game is great, you have to see for yourself."
2,Great part of our bedtime routine,This CD is an important part of our bedtime routine. The music is very calming and our son usually falls asleep before we reach the end of the CD.
2,What Rock Should Be,"WOW! That basically sums up The Who. I love their power chords, energy, and intense musical stylings. After listening to this albulm, and others, I am envious of those who lived when they first broke onto the music scene back in the 60s (I am only 20). The Who is what rock is supposed to be like."
2,Solid Mystery,"This is the 2nd Mas Arai mystery but I read them out of order. I actually read her third mystery first and her first mystery second and this one last.As far as I can tell they are all about the same. The mysteries are complex and difficult to solve although the books are quite short. Except for the daughter, the so-called ""gasa-gasa girl"" the characters are interesting and unique. I read a review that her use of Japanese words and phrases was frustrating because she gave no definitions so I paid careful attention when reading this book and I did not find that to be the case here. Perhaps that was a problem with the first book. I think most people would find this enjoyable."
2,Jimmy MacElroy,"After spending an evening driving around to all of the local movie rental stores to try to find Blades of Glory, I decided it was about time to add this one to the collection. The online movie sites are generally extremely useful, however, in this situation they were useless. Despite the moment being passed that evening, it was rekindled several days later. Great movie!"
2,I wanted it to be better,"I love Amelia Atwater-Rhodes. I've read all of her books and for the most part loved them. I've been especially caught up in the entire Kiesha'ra series. The plights of the avian and serpiente is absolutely facinating and I've gotten too involved in it ;-)I was stoked when I saw Falcon Dance was coming out. I hopped on Amazon and bought it asap and started consuming it as soon as it arrived. But by the end I was slightly dissapointed. I think I might have liked the book more had it focused on Oliza (since I love both Danica and Zane and was upset at how little they appeared). I did like Nicias, but I didn't find him nearly as likeable as the others.The book itself is engaging and facinating and most of the characters are quite complex (I especially liked Darien). Though I have mixed feelings on this book, I did enjoy it and can't wait for the next 2 volumes."
2,great book,"my first Lewis and Clark book, couldn't put it down. Just enough, not too short or too long. What a great adventure!"
2,Great insight - beautiful writing,It doesn't matter what you think of Ronald Reagan - this book is uplifting and insightful.I think what most people will find somewhat surprising is the intellectual depth that Reagan had. He fooled his opponents at every turn.Especially touching in this book is how he writes about his love for Nancy. He speaks of feeling lonely everytime she left the room. It was just an amazing love the most powerful man on earth felt.This is a great Sunday morning book when you are sitting by the fireplace on a cool autumn morning. Enjoy!
2,Enchanting,"Disney's masterpiece Sleeping Beauty (1959) is one of my favorite Disney films because it's not only gorgeously animated, but the music, characters and even the look itself is PERFECT for the movie! Plus I always thought Aurora was by far the most beautiful female character by Disney animators, hehe."
2,GREAT HEADSET,"I PURCHASED ONE OF THESE HEADSETS WITH MY NEW MOTOROLA V710 AND WAS IMPRESSED WITH IT'S PERFORMANCE. USING THE HS820 IN THE CAR WAS VERY EFFECTIVE AND EASY. THE MICROPHONE DOES A GOOD JOB OF CANCELLING OUT BACKGROUND NOISE AND WAS VERY EASY TO HEAR EVEN WITH THE WINDOW DOWN AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS. THE MULTIPURPOSE BUTTON ON THE UNIT INTERFACES WITH THE MOTOROLA PHONE TO MAKE HANDS-FREE VOICE DIALING AND NUMBER DIALING. VERY LIGHTWEIGHT AND COMFORTABLE TO WEAR. THE ONLY THING THAT REMINDS ME THAT I'M WEARING IT AT NIGHT, IS THE BLUE FLASHING PILOT LIGHT. OVERALL A VERY GOOD HANDS-FREE HEADSET."
2,"Great yoga video, with lots of routines","This is my second copy of this product, after my other one was worn out. I really like the breadth of yoga routines that it offers that are specific to various sports one might participate in. I use it for the hiking and biking routines to help keep me limber after years of injuries piling up."
2,Real Gangstas Come Out Of Philly !!!!!,"What's really good is this State Property album ,anybody that understand and can relate to real music should go out and buy this album from the first track to Young Chris airing it out on 94 bars you need this album holla"
2,Good for skating too,Brother of mine has many actors figures he likes lots play to.So I made him very happy when I bought this cutting board.I wanted to mmake a salad for mothers day thats why I bought it.As ather people sad it might be a lot slippery and whan I bought it I first tried to cut it on.But it sleeped on my foot and made me very unhappy.I was running up or down very unhappy but my brother become very happy because he took it down to his room and used it up for skathing park.So I think its a good board.I take one star out because they cut off a very beautiful birch tree to make this board and now my brother will see one birch less tree when he grows old.
2,High Power Low Cost,"At the last Anahiem WW Show I decided to get the M12V. I was some what sceptical when I seen the price deference between the other makers of comparible HP. I bought it! I have 5 routers, I use them all! I make furniture and cabinetry. I cut 30-50 raised panel doors a month using every specie of wood imaginable. Maple, Koa and Cherry giving us the hardest time with burning and splintering. The M12V has been great. The height adjustment works well- not perfect. The wood can be pushed thru fast or slow with little bog. The true test is its ability to be forgiving when coping a rail. What I really like about- its quite, it can handle my work load and it was so cheap that I can throw it away and buy another one without blinking. Good luck and cut wood!!!!"
2,Registered Nurse,"This is a very well tolerated and pleasantly lemon-flavored calcium supplement. Some of the previously tried supplements irritated my wife's stomach and were difficult to swallow because of their size. These are easily chewed and absorbed. She is keeping this brand of calcium supplement.Thanks, OS-CAL"
2,Finally!,"A dark, brooding record with hooks and melodies -- Blondie meets My Bloody Valentine with a dash of Cat Power. Singer/songwritery without the cheese factor. Yup, this is one of those records -- a real Long Player with great songs start to finish. ""Diamond Ring"" and ""Unable"" get things running, but it's ""Cry An Ocean"" and ""Providence"" that have legs. Where'd they come from? A quick Google search verified my suspicion -- these are the same people from Ugly Beauty, who you might remember (if you're over 25) from the mid-90's. Awesome bands, both."
2,Great!,Brad Paisley has once again released a great album. I especially like Online. A truer song has never been written!
2,"Almost as funny as seasons 1 to 3, several great episodes","Although the quality of the animation really improves about this time, the writing becomes a tad more inconsistent. All of the episodes start off with a bang, bringing the usual incisive wit to everyday situations, but some of them occasionally lose their level of humor just a wee bit as the writers become more concerned with resolving the main story line than generating ""Groeningesque"" humor, and this problem grows much more in the much later seasons of the show, where crudeness is occasionally substituted for real wit. However, even the worst episode in the season four shows is pretty funny. Standout episodes like Streetcar Named Marge, Mr. Plow, Lisa's First Word, Selma's Choice, Marge Vs. The Monorail and others are shining examples of the show at its best and I'm looking forward to purchasing this set as soon as it is released."
2,No spinduster,While the vacuum has lots of suction it is not too easy to use as the floor tool pulls off center. The spinduster was listed as an accessory so I ordered it. It does not work with this model Eureka.
2,Great Classic - 5 Stars,"This movie is a must have for anyone that is a big, or small fan of Paul Newman. George Kennedy is equally as great & keeps the movie going. The egg eating scene is within itself a must see & seems so real, I can almost feel my own stomach swell. Strother Martin is cool & collect with the line, ""What we've got here is a failure to communicate"". I give this classic 5 stars."
2,Great light bulbs for our outdoor spotlights,"We had a lot of trouble finding a bulb at the home improvement stores to fit in our outdoor landscape spotlights, but this one finally fit!"
2,For all those people who thought they could never exercise,I bought this book last November and read it through completely. I also performed the basic tests that determine each person's level of fitness. This week I finally got around to starting the actual Core Program and I can't believe how good I feel after each session. The most appealing thing about the program is that you don't have to be young and fit to do it and it's designed particularly for women. I have experienced immediate relief of hip pain and discovered that some of the strength building exercises I had been doing with hand held weights are not good for me. This book is really life changing. I wish she would make a tape!
2,Big Bling,This ring is pretty nice. Its very flashy and very big. if you wanna make heads turn then I think this is the ring for you. People will be complimenting on it all night.
2,Walking fast,"I really like this walkman. It gets excellent reception and is lightweight. I have already walked miles and miles with it and I haven't had to change the batteries yet. I purchased it because I often like to listen to the radio, including the news. Very satisfied. Can't beat the price."
2,I knew it...,"I missed this movie at the theatre, but really wanted to see it. I enjoyed it, but unfortunately I knew what would happen. It was pretty obvious right away. I like both actors, and they did a good job with their parts, respectively."
2,Describing is impossible,"Describing is truely impossible with this band...if anyone can explain how these guys sound genre wise be my guest :). I'm from Lincoln, NE which is about 50 miles away from where these guys are from and I'll tell you what they are really neat guys that have the talent that it takes to get big. They started out as a indie band, sounded like another Omaha band Bright Eyes. On their second album they started toying with electronica and brought in some keyboards...it was quite dark and dirty but that is just what I loved about it! With this new record Danse Macabre, the synths are clean and beautiful. With party anthems like ""Glass Danse"" and a dedication to all the conductors out there ""The Conductor"" you can't go wrong with this record. (personal fav song is ""Total Job"") So if you want a record that is different from the rest and gives you the chance to take a bite out of it The Faint are a great place to start! Check these guys live if you can!"
2,*shrug* I definitely don't get the fuss.,"I psychotically LOVED this book. The Ardeur is truly its star, as it forces Anita to face some of her most pressing control issues. But more than anything else, as a reader since book 1, Incubus Dreams was well worth it for ONE particular tryst alone.*sigh* The most satisfying fictional sex I ever had."
2,Great for chewers without a big mess,"I get these for my dog. He is a big chewer, and he loves to get to work on the quado bone. I get the ginormous. It lasts him about 35-45 minutes (which is good for him). I like these because they chew completely away without leaving a big mess like the busy bones. Also, with rawhide, he has a tendency to chew for a little while and then swallow a big section without having chewed it. Not good upon exit. =0)"
2,cheaper than in store.,pet supplies plus sells this product for a much higher markup... not the best quality plastic but good enough and i like it... sooo i say go for it.
2,Very Good,"I'll admit it, I was never a Marilyn Manson fan. Antichrist Superstar had about two good songs on it. I then heard some clips of some songs off Mechanical Animals, and immediately bought the CD. It's very different from the last one, and it's very good. Plus, it's packaging is unique, with hidden stuff inside the booklet."
2,very shiny and its a perfect fit...,"i like this braclet knowing its a bit of a hassle for me to put on until i figure out a way to get it on by myself lol, but its nice it is kinda bendable but it can come back out like it was which is good i guess, just dont get it hung on something cause it may brake it, i know there is a peice thats by the clump that kinda is pushed in someway but idk if that was how it came or not.i really do like the mesh look and got many comments on it, and it feels good on my skin as well.. i like it and i hope this helps you in getting one possibly..."
2,Very Nice Surf CD,"Whenever I close my eyes to this CD, I am right there at Panama City Beach as a teenager. : ) The sound of the surf combined with the noise of the gulls are a nice combination. It's not to bad to sleep to either. The volume does fluxuate a bit (some waves coming in soft and others louder along with the gulls) but it usually doesn't bother me. Certainly worth getting!"
2,SPACE 1999 THE NEXT GENERATION!,"If you want to see the science fiction show that bridged the first Star Trek and the Next Generation, this is it.Many of the plots, characters and ideas would be used for the next generation series , and even The X-files and Alien. When Space 1999 came out in the early 70's George Lucas claimed he woudn't have been able to make Star Wars without it. Even today the show feels very modern with its blend of gothic horror, the paranormal and science fiction. Many episodes are filmed in a neo-surrealistic style akin to Luis Bunel and Hitchcock. This mega set is the way to go, since it has year 1 and 2 episodes in order and bonus material. In a long run it will be cheaper to buy this set than the individual sets. This is the sci-fi release of 2003!!!!!!!"
2,Works great,It works just like it is supposed to. Gave new life to an old record player. Have it connected to a new surround sound theater system.
2,A decent present for a cook,"My wife aspires to greatness in the kitchen (lucky me!), but likes to find interesting things as well. This book was slimmer than I thought it would be, but still had some neat history as well as recipes.Probably best given to a person with some anthropological interests along with liking to cook."
2,Wonderful!!!,Just an overall family fun comedy from the 60's.... Great for adults and kids alike. Never gets old. Great Seller.
2,How Good Are They,"NSYNC made a really good album, as their first album to come out. The songs are very interesting. The songs have a catchy tune and all of their singles are great. Unlike BSB they can dance well, and JC and Justin have really outstanding voices(they were the ones who had most of the solo's in the songs) The rest of the group blends very well and sounds great. BSB dosen't really have that harmony like NSYNC. NSYNC is really good and their next album will be great."
2,This Bed is a Best Buy,"This bed stands head and shoulders above another rollaway bed I purchased from Amazon. Instead of a noisy, sagging wire mesh, it has hard-wood slats for solid mattress support. Instead of an innerspring mattress in which the springs break through and poke you in the side, it has a comfortable 5"" foam mattress. In my opinion, this is a low-cost bed that can't beat. I give it two thumbs up!"
2,Excellent Support from Manufacturer,"After I set up the remote, I couldn't re-sync to my computer and update it. It turned out to be a problem with my computers settings, which Logitech support caught in the first few minutes of the call. However, the tech spent the better part of an hour on the phone with me setting up my remote, at his end, so it would work better. Excellent service. This remote's expensive, but you get what you paid for."
2,valueable for every goatpacker,"One of the few books about goatpacking. Filled with information about selecting, raising, training and packing with goats, about equipment for packgoats, feeding and health issues and camp techniques.A simple ""must have"" for every goatpacker and those who want to start packing with goats."
2,Good Season,"A lot of people seemed to have problems with the second season, which at first made me a little weary but I can assure you that it is really good. A slightly different tone than the first season but still good. Though I do have a few recommendations, first of all watch the OVA before watching the second season. It'll clear up a lot, also you'll need the internet for to understand the season finale. It was really confusing for me, but made sense once I looked it up online. It's a good series, and the second season doesn't disappoint. The OVA is really damn good as well."
2,classic books,I thoroughly enjoyed this book...I am one who started reading late in life and i reccomend this book as a must read. Very poignant!
2,All in all a good book,"Has, single column references, and is a little bit thicker than advertised (1.8""). Has for pages of maps, a one page introduction, printed in Moscow, has a short concordance (16 pages)."
2,Performs Well,"I got this 17"" HP notebook 5 days ago (22JUL07). General impression: I did the right thing buying it for home use. For business I will continue to use an Asus V6J.The Good: good performance, nice UI, generous screen, thin and light (for a 17"").Not so good: too many little blue lights (18 including the xb3000 docking); the silver plastic looks cheap; stickers didn't peel easily.I would recommend this 17"" notebook for home use."
2,Love it!,"After reading the reviews for this product - I felt I needed to share what a great product I think it is. I was lucky enough to receive the bather as a shower gift. As a new mom, I didn't really know what to expect. Since my daughter's birth we've traveled several thousand miles and I love the product. It fits nicely into any square sink and I've found it to be very sturdy. My daughter loves the feel of the mesh fabric and is very comfortable. I get to stand while bathing her instead of kneeling over a slippery tub which is much more comfortable for me. Since I'm standing, I feel that I have much more control over her during bathtime. The bather cleans easily and is quite compact for storage. I have three girlfriends and a sister who are expecting and I've recommended the bather to all of them."
2,Stunning photography of African women,"This collection is a must for anyone who appreciates the beauty of women of African descent. The photos burst with color, and are so crisp you'd swear the subject is only inches away. Well, one can dream I suppose. Although I don't particularly care for poetry, there is an abundance scattered throughout the book."
2,Motorola Li-Ion battery,Arrived very quickly. Appears the same as the original. I don't remember how long the original lasted but I am using blue tooth and getting about two days with this battery with 2-4 hours of actual talk time in those days. I am happy with that.
2,!! I LOVE SALSA !!,"The first time I heard of these guys was when they opened for Victor Manuelle at a show that I saw in Miami. They did there thing. They got the crowd going with their vocals and there dance moves. The Groups is up by Hector, Felix, and Ricky. Not only is NKLABE 3 talented singers but their band is made up of a bunch young talented musicians. After I saw the show I had to buy the CD and it's great. The best tracks on the CD are I Love Salsa, Evitare, Quizas, Amor de Una Noche, and Tiempo. This CD has great tracks to dance to and they sound awesome. Check out the CD, you won't be disappointed =) I LOVE SALSA!!!!"
2,"What Jesus ""really said"" about the End Times.","It has been a good while since I have read this book. It is both scholarly (written by a non-fundamentalist New Testament scholar) and entertaining. Jewett shows how the Jesus of the Gospels is not a world-obliterating Apocalyptic figure, but a world restoring Messiah. This is a good place to start if you want to read an author who is ""reality oriented"" on this topic."
2,Best Kids' Bible Movies,"My kids (ages 5 and 2) loves the Greatest Adventure series. I grew up watching these on VHS, and I was so happy to find that a few of them have been made available on DVD. These are far superior to Veggie Tales and other modern sugar-coated kid-friendly interpretations of Bible stories. My kids are actually learning the true story of Moses, and they love it. They'd rather watch this than anything else."
2,Best grill cover EVER!,"Got this to replace our threadbare grill cover. Was pleasantly surprised at the high-quality of the product, especially considering the reasonable price! Large fits perfectly over our grill (we have the kind where the grill is in the center and there's a ""shelf"" on each side). You won't regret buying this cover!!! HIGHLY recommend."
2,something very different,"This is certainly a different approach to Bach, even from Hogwood. While it will never replace my Richter or Gould recordings, in its own way, it offers a vastly different bye still valid reading. But, it is not for the tame of heart. It is not for those that need their Bach hyped up by a virtuoso. It offers a more placid, poetic reading."
2,The Ebay Way,Excellent business book. I learned so much about ebay selling and marketing. Applying principles in this book will produce great results.ISP Certification-The Industrial Security Professional Exam Manual or How to Prepare for and Pass the Industrial Security Professional Certification Exam
2,Give this a try,"This is the first time I have used this product.I read about it in magazines so thought I would see how it works with my skin. I certainly am pleased with the results, you actually feel your skin ""freeze"" just after you apply it - it gives you a feeling your skin is becoming firmer. None of my friends have commented on the difference but I see it myself and if I feel good, then to me I must look good (and not the other way round). I would give it a try."
2,walker,This is a large walker meant for the larger person. It was easy to put together and very easy to use. My only complaint is that the brakes give out easily and have to be adjusted regularly.
2,A great accessory,"I recently got a chance to take a look at these record sheets. They seemed VERY detailed and are just great. They are so easy to photocopy you will almost turn dizzy. The added bonus of the ship and droid record sheets are beautiful as well. The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the character sheet is located in the Core Rule Book as well. The reason I didn't give it 3 stars is because it is MUCH easier to photocopy here. I can't believe how easy it was to find the character piloting skill attribute. That's what I ALWAYS look for first, and it takes me atleast 30 seconds. When I took a glance at these sheets it didn't even take me 10 seconds. The product is great, and if your not a photocopying person, just buy 2 of them. It's a great price and a great product!"
2,The big red atlas,"Has everything listed however not in a organized fashion, 3 insets related to 3 other pages are on one page just because they're within 4 miles of the coast. From N to S on a map it doesnt break in a logical way. There are no insets of large cities main roads such as portland, salem, eugene, corvallis. however, forest service roads are listed and named. which is a great help when highways are closed."
2,Unbelievable...,"This is one of the most heartfelt CDs I've heard in a long time. A friend who heard she was coming to town invited us to see her for $5, and I figured what the heck. WOW! Was I blown away. I haven't stopped talking about it since.I have the album now, and this woman is destined for great things. She is all of my favorite female artists (Raitt, McLaughlin, et al) yet she is none of them. This is the best album I've heard this year. If you get a chance to see her live, do it! Her acoustic version of Jeff Buckley's ""Halleluia"" is one of the most beautiful things my ears have ever heard. It sent shivers all over my body. Top to bottom, an excellent album."
2,He just keeps on goin!,"I purchased the DVD last week and I wasn't disappointed (maybe slightly as it could have been longer) it features the killer on top form, i have other documentaries of him and this one features stuff i have neverseen before. It has the Steve Allen Show (Whole Lotta) but apart from that I havent seen any of the other clips. I thought it would be more of a documentary, but it is just videos of him singing his songs. There could have been more of him doing the Granada TV special, as the full version is something I really would like to own. To anyone who is interested in finding out about the killer, or to a fan who hasnt got this then my advise is to go and get it, nice one."
2,"Not a cookie, not a cracker","If you are like me, you've never actually had a tea biscuit before. Let me tell you it is something entirely unique. It does not crunch or crumble like a cookie. And it is not fragile like a cracker. The volume and weight is unlike anything I've ever had. And at 79 cents per package at my local grocery store, I've now become hooked. Go ahead and enjoy this delicious treat. A wonderful snack for those on diets, 2-4 biscuits with my afternoon coffee curb hunger without killing my diet. Finally, a sweet, tasty treat that is made from NATURAL ingredients and is not loaded with fat and calories."
2,da bomb,"this is a classic. I love Shannon Whirry. what a babe. nice little movie for a night's entertainment..yes, I now it is not Gone with the wind..but it is just what this lonely old guy likes..."
2,Easy to use!,Really great product! Easy to use once you get the hang of it. Takes a minute for it to get a signal but overall highly recommended!
2,Worked great for our soccer ball!,Perfect for checking the ball pressure on our soccer ball. Small enough to carry around in your sports bag with a small pump. Worked great!
2,My husband loved them,I bought these for my husband & he absolutely loved it especially in summer. You can walk on boardwalk of the beach as well as to any casual event. He only brought these on our vacation to Hawaii.
2,Air bed,This is my second airbed. I had a twin that was comfortable. This one is simply awesome. Not a single backache since I received it. The price is a real steal. Buy it! You won't be sorry you did.
2,Awesome spice rack and bottles! Great value.,"This is awesome for the price: a nice, shiny spice rack and 18 little glass jars with shaker-tops.PROS:The bottles are solid glass: spice does not leak through the atoms or teleport outside of the containers.It looks sleek.CONS:In one spot the metal is not the right shape so one of the bottles points a little differently from the others. I don't know if something happened in manufacturing or if it was damaged in shipping: not a huge deal, but I did notice.No funnel included: I really wish they'd give you something! Then again, it's easy enough to fold some foil or even a piece of paper into a conduit to our in your spices."
2,Chop Wizard Technique,"First this is the best tool in our kitchen, buy it, I bought two just to make sure I always have one. After reading the poor reviews (ratings) for this item I believe I know why the results are not good. You must cut the pieces (onions, celery, etc) to be chopped to fit inside the grate, if the pieces are too large and are outside grate results will not be good. Orientation is important, for instance celery must be placed with the convex side UP, onions should be placed on the side that was cut to fit the grate, results will be great. Bottom line, make sure pieces fit inside the grate and are placed in proper orientation. My wife makes stuffing for turkey and uses many onions and celery. Before we got the chopper no one wanted to cut the onions and celery, now we all want to use the chopper, one smack down and pieces are cut perfectly. Two different sizes, very quick, excellent. Believe me cut to proper size and experiment as to what side to put up and you will be happy."
2,"so beautiful album, thanks a lot JOnatan","Thanks to you Jonatan for giving me so much love at your concert in France.I love all of you, ans I listen to your marveillous album 'siempre23' every day and every night. I knoww that you are preparing a new album soon.I miss your smile and your voice who give me sun."
2,A Thorough Account of The Plot and Its Implementation,"Well-done, graphic description of the plot to kill one of the lesser-known but influentially fanatical murderers of Hitler's Germany. There's a bit too much background that readers must wade through to get to the heart of the book--the actual plan for the assassination and the implementation of the act--but it reads well and helps put the event in perspective."
2,Clambake,"I order this DVD because I am a big fan of Elvis and I was not disappointed with the movie. I would recomend this movie to any Elvis fan, not only Elvis fan, but anyone who likes a lot of fun and music from Elvis."
2,Broken.,I thought I already wrote this review a couple of times. It would have been great if one of the clips had not been broken.
2,Sound introduction to Postgres,"There are some production problems with the book. But overall it's a fine introduction to Postgres. This isn't a general introduction as the title seems to imply. This text, graphics, and examples, all clearly relate to Postgres.The book is fairly code heavy. With example of the use of Postgres in all of the popular languages. And a hefty amount of SQL examples to learn from and use.A solid introductory walkthrough for anyone new to, or just starting to use Postgres."
2,Good CD,"Very good CD. A must for third eye blind fans. Not as good as Blue, but still catchy and energized. Overall worth the purchase."
2,Love the dynamics!,"Strong characters!!! Great plot, still keeps you guessing. Middle brother Ben is really showing leadership abilities! Wasn't a fan of alien type movies but this one caught my eye. Still don't understand Karen."
2,Beautiful,"My only complaint is that I thought the stick would be longer. On the single stick items, the lenght is about 6in. The decorative end is quite ornate and lovely, but they are small. It may get a little lost in your hair.It takes some practice to figure out how to use one of these, but they do work. As long as you are not jumping arond or head banging it will hold appropriately even though it is slick. My own hair is long and very fine and it still does its job."
2,"Great price, great shirts","These American Apparel dog tshirts are super cute! Purchasing them through Andrew Christian on Amazon is an EXCELLENT deal - it beats out any deals from American Apparel themselves!The shirts are well made and machine washable. We got a size Small for our petite Yorkshire Terrier. Although it still fit well, it was a little frumpy and loose in the stomach area, so the next t-shirts we got were XSmall - and they fit wonderfully. Not too tight and well-fitted on our dog."
2,"Author admits bias, but good perspective on how societies start","Just finished this book today... Of course this book is biased, he admits this in the ""Afterword"" section, in the first few paragraphs. Of course he has a few opinions about different groups of people being ""smarter"" than others (Eurasians) but he admits that it is his opinion. It's a great persective and I think it supplements nicely with other history books, filling up a few ""holes"" in history....which is riddled with biased holes like swiss cheese! It's interesting and I won't take his extensive work for granted. Also, his afterword gives a lot of insight of how free trade, free economies and de-centralized governments provide a better standard of living for everyone. Examples include the differences between South/North Korea, former East/West Germany, the D. Republic and Haiti...etc. Great points!If anything, Diamond is biased in multiple accounts but the book is nothing short of amazing..."
2,Outstanding source book,"Outstanding book for your Jewelry Library or those interested in Southwestern style jewelry, pictures are great in this worthwhile book."
2,"Great, out of print book",This was my favorite book as a small child. It's about old timer fire fighter and old time fire truck who are looked down upon by the younger fire fighters because of their age. Then one day a big fire breaks out in the city leaving the old man and engine alone in the fire house when a call comes in for house fire. The old timer and the engine save the day. Wonderful lesson.
2,Every parent should have this book!!!!,I am a social worker and am always looking for ways to help kids learn how to keep themselves safe when safe adults are not available. This book gives great tips on how to teach kids how to do just that. Parents aren't always able to be there and this book gives kids tools they need to be able to rely on themselves if/when needed. I have read this book several times since receiving it and have used the methods with my own 4 year old child as well as the foster kids I work with. The book is able to be used with kids as young as 2 on up....great book with very practical and life saving advice.
2,GR,"The Right Questions is an amazing book! It is a clear and understandable tool to help you make choices that are consistent with the direction that you want to be heading in your life. I have already developed a practice of using these simple questions to help me gain new perspective and insight in making business and personal decisions, both big and small.I have even purchased copies of the books for all of my employees and many of the people with whom I do business."
2,Great game but next to impossible,"The graphics and gameplay are fantastic! This game offers no setting as far as difficulty and is so challenging It can be annoying. I think that this game offers a lot of hours of fun however, and if you are a fan of the series it is a must have!"
2,Good Easy Listening CD,"Don't judge a CD by its cover. That would definitely apply here. The cover art would seem to suggest either rap or reggae music but neither would be the case here. All the selections on ""Sun of Jamaica"" are in the same easy listening vein as ""Guantanamera"" though that particular song is not included on this CD. Favourite selections on this CD would be the title song ""Sun of Jamaica"", ""Seven Tears"" and ""Rain"", though the rest of the CD is just as pleasant to listen to. If you want some mildly lively, easy on the ears music, give this CD a spin."
2,Beautiful and well designed,"We bought a set of these and love them. They are beautiful, elegant and of significant weight. When you hold them and look at them up close you can tell they are a high quality flatware.We wash them in our dishwasher and haven't had any discoloration problems. You have to be careful not to let them sit in standing water; specially the knives. Any satin finish flatware will show weird staining/spotting if you don't take proper care of it.Great set for the price. Looks great on our formal dining table when we have friends over!"
2,Fantastic,"This is a super doll, sent to my sister-in-law. Enjoyed immensely by her, with the name Susie and carried everywhere by her 3-year old grandson (picture that). The vendors are extremely helpful and courteous, offering the best kind of service. Thanks."
2,AMAZING,"It's about time someone made a cd where every song is good and not just the first released. Avril Lavigne's new cd 'Let Go' is positively one of the best cd's I have ever bought. If it were a tape, I would've worn it out already, cuz I swear I play the cd about 15 times a day beginning to end. Every single song has a great message and makes you wanna get up and sing. It's a great cd, and the fact that Avril is just 17 (like myself) is even more amazing. Do I sound obsessed? That's cuz I am! Avril has loads of talent and I hope that everyone else gives her a chance as well. If you don't have the cd, go out and buy it, it won't be a waste of your money.~Avril's #1 fan: Holly~"
2,Food Inc,"This DVD is basically a documentary about how meat is processed in this country and it was very informative. I purchased it after hearing about it on the Oprah Winfrey show. After watching it 3 times, I became a vegetarian at the age of 56 years old. It changed my life and made me realize that a lot of the sickness and disease we suffer from today is a direct result of what we eat. I am healthier and in better physical condition than when I was a carnivore."
2,CLAYMAZING!!,"Listen to Clay sing one time and you will be hooked for life. He is nothing short of amazing...or in Clay speak...Claymazing! His range is unreal. His vocal tone soothes the soul. You will get tears listening to this man sing. He is already a superstar, an American Idol, the kind of entertainer, the kind of human being, that the world has been starving for. Congratulations to a good soul who is getting what he deserves. You will never regret buying this CD."
2,Shower gift from Amazon.,Children's books were requested for a recent shower I attended for my niece. All the other books given were for children who enjoy listening rather than learning from the information. I didn't realize this was the type of book I was ordering but I was satisfied to have given a gift that was different from the others. I was happy with the overall transaction.
2,Great Toy,"My daughter recieved this toy for her 1st birthday, and loves it. This is the only toy that I have found that keeps her entertained for a long time. She has played with it everyday since she got it. She loves to take the blocks out and put them back again, She also loves to dance to the cute little tune it play's. I would recommend this toy to anyone that has a one year old, over all it is a great toy, and very educational for this age level."
2,Do not hesitate. Buy this now.,Such a great CD to put in and just sit back and enjoy. Groovy tunes with great flow.
2,Great Shredder,"I've used this shredder several times in the last couple of months. On the first use, I had a stack of at least 100 sheets of paper. I fed the unit 3 or 4 sheets at a time with no problems. With 5 sheets, I could hear the motor bog down a bit but it still did the job. At no time did I have to wait for the unit to cool down."
2,An Enjoyable Read,"Downloaded this to my Kindle a few months ago and finally pulled it up to read. At first I thought it was going to be slow and a bit boring, but the storyline did pick up, the humor made me laugh out loud and I read several paragraphs to my husband to share the parts that made me laugh. At the time, I was looking for something light and humorous, so it fit the bill. I work with elderly people, so I kind of understand some of the LOL things Ivy encountered, like being ""invisible"". I enjoyed the fact that she decided to see this as a benefit, rather than moping about it. The Christianity part might have been handled differently; it wasn't so bad that you couldn't see it and move on. I've read a lot worse! I'm looking forward to reading the next one."
2,As good as the movie,"I watched the movie and realy liked so I picked up the attack of the clones and totally fell for it's fun action packed book.They described the romance between padma and anakin so well plus I really enjoyed the characters of Jango and Bobba fett. I know alot of the people didn't like the movie but try the book you might be suprised, I was. While I enjoyed the movie the book was at least as good if not better."
2,Good book but I'd recomend NOT TO GET THE KINDLE VERSION,"*** I'd strongly recommend picking up a HARD COPY of this book, I am reading it on my iPad and I wish I'd paid for a hard copy to scribble in the margins and post-it the action items I ought to focus on. (See more info on why in comments)*****I'm only a couple chapters into this book and thus far it's got me to a T! Within the first few examples I saw myself in situations that either I handled poorly or completely inadequately but Frankel's action points and suggestions have already helped me top and think about how I ought to have handled a situation and how the outcome could have been not only better but beneficial for my professional development if I'd handled them better.Based on what I've read so far any working woman should read this book. Heck all women should read this book, I can see ways I can develop personally through all her professional recommendations as well."
2,Met My Expectations,"Overall I was satisfied with this purchase. The necklace looks as it is portrayed in its image and description. My only issue with the product was that some of the stones and pearls were loosely attached to the chain and fell off when the necklace was removed from the box. While this is an easy fix (no tools required), I would advise customers to check the necklace for this and make sure it is all in one piece as soon as it arrives, especially if it is intended to be a gift."
2,Molex power supply cable splitter,Needed to add another hard drive but didn't have a spare molex power cable so this splitter was just what the doctor ordered. Seemed to be of the same quality as the cables coming from the power supply and worked without any issues.
2,Move over John Grisham,"I hardly put the book down after i have started the first page, the plot was great i kept on reading until 2-3 in the morning and as a result i finished the book within 2 days i have never before finished any book with that length of time. This book is highly recommended to any one who loves thriller, you can't get any better than this. As for Russel Andrews ""Bravo"" I can't wait for your next book. I am devorcing John Grisham for you!."
2,Good feeling from good entertainment,"As one of the many positive 80's movies, this rates at the top because of the interesting storyline, great combination of acting, memorable soundtrack and well exicuted cinematography. It is likely to appeal to those who are romantic at heart, but also holds a place for teens learning to deal with their weird parents and the rigours of school life. I have worn out one video copy, just a shame it isn't available in PAL format anymore."
2,Great book,"It is so disturbing that we don't learn from history and do the same mistakes again and again. It is a wonderful book that puts human faces to all the major American regime change operation in the past century. It is usually a handful of people and their ambitions which spark these events. Most of the time, the outcomes are not good for America and they were even worse for the people in the countries that had a regime change. And for the cases of especially Iran and (possibly) the current regime change in Iraq, the outcome is really bad for the entire world. It is a ""must read"" book."
2,Afghans on the Double,Afghans on the Double (Leisure Arts #102662) (Crochet Treasury Series)This book has a lot of very good patterns. I have made two of them and they are GREAT!! The patterns are easy to read and understand and they make up very fast.
2,Everything Old Is New Again,"I happened to meet the author at an expo in NY before I ever read his books; what a shame, the questions I would have asked! Anyhow, these books belong in any thinking person's library because they go to the fundamental questions of ""Who are we?"" and ""How did we get here?"" The scholarship is top notch. The hypothesis is very convincing. The worst thing is that you will come away with a lot more knowledge than you had before you began reading the series. But who created the Annunuki? That is the question!"
2,A harrowing tale of political intrigue that asks....,"how far will a man go to succeed in life? This film delves more deeply into the samurai/ronin/political psyche than any other film I have seen! It is a brutal, violent and at the same time beautiful film. The cinematography is flawless. The music is haunting. I usually don't like narration but the narrator in this film takes your breath away! Everything about this film is powerful. Mifune's portrayal of Niiro is fascinating! His is a dark portrait of a very complex man driven to self-loathing and murder by his own ambition. The story jumps through time at a frantic pace yet the film is so well done that you are never confused. The final confrontation in the snowstorm is incredible! There are two rather talkie scenes but these do not diminish the power of the rest of the film. At the end of two very intense hours we are left wondering what might have happened if the truth had been revealed!"
2,Reviewing the Reviews,"I have read a lot of reviews, and I just wanted to put in my 2 cents incase it helps anyone out.the book starts out very interesting. It gets a little boring in the center. It ends strong.All together it is a brilliant piece. Be careful with the bad reviews. Many of them didn't finish the book. They just quit in the middle.The end is worth it. Its an amazing piece.Watchmen"
2,Snow White,Excited to get this video - very happy with price and DVD. Our granddaughters have watched this movie at least 4 times already.
2,"Lots of features, except heat!","Has a lot of features, and the remote makes it great so you don't have to bend over. Only problem is the water is not heated-you have to add hot water yourself. Otherwise, attachments are a lot of fun."
2,Some wonderful nature writing here,"This book will make you want to get out into the places beyond the artifacts of civilization and spend some time in the beauty and quiet. Some of our best poets (Wendell Berry, Gary Snyder) and writers (Robert Bly, Matthew Fox, Terry Tempest Williams) tell us eloquently why they go to the wilderness to be closer to themselves and their God. Inspiring!"
2,MYSTERY:BIRACIAL KILLER OF COPS,"Slow moving at first but graduallypicks up speed, If you don't putit down, it will flow smoothlyuntil you can't put it down!Louis Kincaid is a black ex-cophired by wife of man found brutally stabbed to death, facebeaten to a pulp with traces ofblack spray paint. The scene is one of the Florida Keys; if you'vebeen there you know the beauty ofthem. Police chief Dan Wainwrightcalls for help from the FBI butfeels insulted when a profilershows up. Several more cases turnup before they finally decide thekiller is a light colored biracialperson and try to find out hisreason for the killings. A bit ofpsychology involves the problemsfaced by some biracial people.Interesting theories and smartdetective work."
2,great book,wonderful book that shipped quickly. Finished this book in two days...the author did quite well with this writing and combined all other books as well. Love her writing
2,works very well!,"i love this juicer, it arrived on time and i couldn't be more pleased with it. The only thing is the food trapper thing, the part that needs to be scabbed cause the food gets in it did loose its shape. Meaning the metal bent a little and it most likey will need to be replaced, but i think that happens and its something that most likely needs to be replaced with time. Anyway I'm pleased!"
2,highly recommended!,"I recommend Idiocracy to everyone. Luke Wilson is very funny, the movie is insightful and made me laugh so hard I had tears running down my face several times.Keep an eye out for a cameo by the guy from the Mac commercials as Dr. Lexus. I found his performance Oscar-worthy, especially considering what Oscars have been handed out for in the last few years...besides, he's cute.In short, Idiocracy is a fatally funny glimpse into a possible future where people are named after product brand names (the president's middle name is Mountain Dew), hospital visits cost $5 billion dollars, there are mountains of garbage because no one is smart enough to figure out what to do with it all, and nobody cares about anything but money. All because only stupid people are breeding. Sounds familiar to me, somehow.Seriously, watch this movie. On a scale of 1 to 10, I give it a brilliant! Now pass the twinkies, scrote..."
2,Mogadishu - An Unforgettable Place In A Rescue-Gone-Bad,"Mogadishu - not a place you want to go and vacation.....at least not in 1992 when this ""Black Hawk Down"" disaster took place.After seeing the film a few times, I thought I'd finally get around to reading all the details about this brutal historical event in Mark Bowden's book. I wasn't disappointed. My only complaint on the book was the maps didn't always seem to jive with the descriptions of the events as they were unfolding, which was frustrating.Still, it's an amazing true-life account and Bowden spares no details in describing it, both good and bad."
2,Romantic story of Elizabeth Von Kaserin,A film for all ages. Beautiful cinematography and sumptuos settings. Bavaria in its natural splendor is the setting for one of the best love stories with a happy ending. This is a classic promoting love for nature and simplicity.
2,"This is a very good, well-written CD!","This is a great album. The music is very captivating and coherent. The songs are all very insightful and superbly written and the lyrics are worth studying. They contain a lot of truth. Overall all though, the melodies will remain in your head and will be the factor that brings you back. Definately worth the money."
2,A Classic We Will Always Remember,"1976 King Kong is a classic. King Kong looks very real especialy the eyes. The new King Kong was ok yes we have come along way since 1976 or even 1930 but I have to tell ya out of all the kong movies I have to say the 1976 movie is the best & always will be. Jessica Lange was young she did ok not her best, & she even said that in her Bio. First acting job did you read the movie, introducing Jessica Lange give the girl a break she was hired for how she looked plain & simple. I love this King Kong when he falls & lands in the streets of New York & you hear his heart beat it just breaks your heart because they took him away from his home & shot him & he dies how very sad. To me the new Kong looks to fake the 1976 Kong looks real good story line alot of good actors from the 70's & kong he just touch your heart & yet you don't want to make him mad."
2,Does anyone know where I can Find a Copy of this CD??,Please email me at roughcherry@yahoo.com if you know any place. Thanks. - Dom
2,A Struggling Life,"Walter has a speech impairment and is not able to talk properly without messing up. In his life, he tries so hard to fit in. His classmates make fun of him becuase he is unlike the other students. During his lifetime, he goes through many struggles but is able to go on with his life."
2,YUP!,"Yup, you got it, this door stop rocks my world! I can't live without it! Who would have known? Fabulous!"
2,Another Computer Guru Book,"WINDOWS NT/2000Network SecurityAUTHOR: E. Eugene SchultzPUBLISHER: New RidersREVIEWED BY: Barbara RhoadesBOOK REVIEW: This 400+ page book should not give the reader eyestrain, as the font is a fairly readable size. Windows NT/2000, Network Security provides an overview of Windows NT, the structure of Windows NT Security, its environment and security exposures plus configuring and maintaining security as well as other types of security and how to handle them.Each Chapter ends with a Case Study, a Conclusion, and a Checklist for System Administrators. There are six Appendixes, a 24 page Index, a 9 page Content list and some graphical examples of the reading material.Anyone responsible for security of their company's computers should add this book to his/her library."
2,A Classic Voice in the Modern Age,"Tuey Connell has a wonderful voice and music that sounds similar to the blues or jazz. His style is similar to singers like Fank Sinatra and the singers of the 40s. He is incredibly talented yet not well known. This album is a collection of love songs and might be a little sappy for some, but is great for easy listening or a slow dance with the one you love. Most of the songs are slow to medium fast and involve a wide variety of instruments."
2,Touching,I first heard this book when I was at a conference and it brought tears to everyones eyes. The meaning this book brings across is one to hold on to and remember all through your life. This is a very touching story to read no matter what age you are.
2,FABULOUS STUFF!,"I recently had a child about 1 month ago, so needless to say the bottom of my feet looked nasty & cracked on the bottom. I have tried everything for the last year to remove the callus off the bottom of my feet, pregnancy just made it worse. I just had a pedicure this past weekend and the woman used this product and I could not believe how smooth my feet are!! This is the best product to remove callus! My husband will actually rub my feet for me now!"
2,A Flawless Find!,"In the midst of the summer's challenges for skin and hair,I am thrilled to have found Dr. Taylor's book. Dr.Taylor has included so much valuable information in a very accessible format. She appeals to our common sense which makes her suggestions palatable and easy to follow. The reader does not walk away feeling bad about choices previously made in the area of hair and skin care. Rather you feel motivated to succeed in moving in a new direction. So often advisors in these areas relish giving advice with out regard for the client. Dr. Taylor's approach is quite different. Her specific suggestions along with product names leave the reader feeling capable. Finally, the fact that Dr. Taylor is a physician gives this reader greater confidence in her advice. Additionally as a woman of color and mother of two girls, I know she can relate to my experiences. Thank you Dr. Taylor for walking us through the maze!A MUST FOR THE HOLIDAY LISTS!"
2,"Good taste, good texture","These potatoes come out pretty fluffy, especially considering that I make them using the microwave. And they taste nicely cheesy, and a lot better than I remember boxed potatoes tasting. But getting 12 boxes at once was pretty overwhelming; I gave 4 of them to a friend who uses them for her shepherd pie, and I still have 5 of them."

2,Awesome Price!,"This product was $40 at Walmart and only $4 here including shipping!Best buy wanted $27 for a three footer, so I guess $1.57 for a six footer, plus $2.43 shipping and handling seemed to good to be true.It's gold plated just like all the others! Great Buy! I bought a bunch for my friends and family!"
2,Would not order this set.,"I was pleasantly surprised at how quickly I received this from the shipper! Unfortunately, I did not love the pattern. There were a lot of white sections and it was really leafy. I was looking for something paisley with bright and pretty pinks and greens. The colors were pretty & I loved the stripes; you could match a lot with it. Those leafy sections just made it look cheap looking to me, especially the comforter. Although I am in the process of returning the entire set, I would order from this seller again. The seller made the returning part very easy and understood that I did not like the set once I saw it in person. I gave 4 stars because the seller was great but the item was not!"
2,A must have if you are in the corporate business world.,We reference this book often to bring laughter to our colleagues and friends. A great present for those in the corporate world.
2,Greatest rpg yet,"Neverwinter Nights is basically the wet dream of every pnp rpg geek out there. Good graphics, great implementation of the 3rd ad&d; edition rules, long, complex storyline.The multiplayer side of this game is simply amazing. Included is the Aurora Toolset which allows you to build your own world. Too bad for the relatively small areas, otherwise, hand in hand with a persistent world, this game would have turned out to be just like a free mmorpg."
2,Love it--- most of the time,"I bought this machine about a year ago because of all the features and the terrific price. You definitely have to READ THE INSTRUCTIONS carefully, but it sews beautifully!! It's easy to use and very portable.I have two complaints: 1) I lost the large spool cap-- couldn't find it anywhere (the Brother website was no help at all) but I finally found a replacement at Sears for $2.16 but it cost me 6 bucks to have it shipped. 2) For some reason the automatic threader doesn't always work (time to re-read the instructions to be sure it's threaded properly).Great machine for a beginner or someone wanting to improve their sewing skills (that's me!)"
2,Good Magazine a lot adds,"I got the Magazine sample after 2 months and they are pretty good. Nice articles and a lot of advertising of stuff, so if you are new to hiking this is kind of interesting if you already have your hiking stuff it may be to commercial."
2,Great Album,Contains all of Abba's great songs. Makes you want to get up and dance. Can't keep from tapping your toes.
2,when you think that you know everything... than you discover that it isn't,"I've been strumming guitar for many years. I've read many books about guitar theory and I thought I had a good knowledge of the theory that one should know to master the guitar, but when I first discovered this author Desi Serna I had to admit that I was on the edge of the beginning. I started to study this book and then I bought all his publications. They are always on my desk and every time I reread a chapter I say to myself that I have found a gold-mine.[...]"
2,Highly intelligent and realistically hardboiled,"I was surprised how uncompromising Montalban was about taking us through party politics in post-Franco Spain -- which turned out to be much more interesting than I might have anticipated. There is enough violence to keep one concerned, several fleshed-out characters, a sense of reality throughout. If I have a quibble it's that the reader is subjected to rather too much about what a gourmet the hero-detective is. Otherwise, it was smartly done and I'll read Montalban again."
2,Great series!,"I bought this for my husband for Christmas. He is a fan of war movies and this being the exception because it is based on actual events. Even the interviews were great. Actually seeing the guys who were in the fight you had just seen is remarkable. Even for a chick like me, I have to say it was a great movie! Blu-ray makes it awesome!"
2,My 6 year old loves it.,This book is a very nice addition to my children therapy books library in my private practice. Have read it to my own 6 year old who also enjoyed it.
2,Winnie the Pooh in every nursery ;),Winnie the Pooh is such a classic story and I think everybody loves it. It was the first English book I bought. I love it. This edition is very classic and beautiful.
2,BEST DAMNED HISTORY OF THE CIVIL WAR!!!,"I don't care if this is ""fiction!"" This is by far, better than any other history of the Civil War. Michael Sharaa gets into the minds of the generals of this iconic batlle of the Civil War. There is really not enough to say about how incredible this book truly is. It's a magnifiscent contribution to Military History writing!! I HAIGHLY RECCOMEND THIS!!!!"
2,very good quality sauce,"I found it very helpful to disregard the directions and simply put the noodles in a dish with water and microwave for about three minutes. Add sauceand eat. I find it to be a wonderful lunchtime meal. Three people per serving??? I don't think so. I'm also 6'9"" 265LB and can need an entire pizza at one sitting so I guess it's not the fairest criticism. I enjoyed the sauce because it's not a watery broth. The sauce is warm but not overpowering. For those that aren't accustomed to Thai food add peanut butter, yogurt, or sour cream, depending on the flavor. When I started out I threw peanut butter into just about everything hot. Also try drinking milk Instead of water."
2,Covers all the topics you need to know,"I love Dr. Sears books and products. This is down to earth, offers descriptive insights to what is going on in your belly and your emotional wellbeing, and provides great advice for how to navigate each month of pregnancy.The Portable Pediatrician: Everything You Need to Know About Your Child's Healthis another book they wrote that is a great book to have especially when you want to look up minor symptoms before you talk to your doctor.If you're looking for down to earth mommy reviews of baby products and parenting advice for the first year of life, make sure you visit the website, AllMomsArePerfect.com. It's got crib and stroller buying guides, what to bring to the hospital, and what to expect in terms of recovery for mom after delivery."
2,awesome,"great first album, period. ""Make up your mind"" ""Last Song"" and ""Say im sorry"" have to be by far my favorites. If your looking for a good new band with the sound of Nickleback or something else similar, this cd is WELL worth the money."
2,Betty Johnson and Lydia Gray are simply sublime,"I had the pleasure of being in the audience on the closing night of Betty Johnson and Lydia Gray's '95 stint at the Cafe Pierre in NYC, where this CD was recorded. Hearing Johnson's ""Time After Time"" alone is more than worth the price. Each selection has a life all its own and spending an hour with these two lovely ladies is one of the finest hours any music lover can experience."
2,Another great John Massari score!,"It's hard to describe this movie - campy, yes, strange, definitely unsettling. But it's the John Massari score that stands out for me. I'm pleased to see that the soundtrack for Killer Klowns is now available. It's worth viewing for the music alone!"
2,Amazing hardware package for the price....,"I've been using an earlier model Toshiba Satellite for four years now. I've hauled it all over the U.S., and as it has gotten older, I've certainly stopped babying it. It has never missed a beat, which is why when *this* model became available at an even deeper discount in a brick and mortar store, I picked it up immediately. Although I've only had it a a week (and the true test comes over time), it works great. Had a small issue with the integrated wireless connecting to my WEP-protected network. I changed the encryption at the router to WPA-PSK, and it it's worked fine. Although the bundled software isn't terrific, it's adequate, and overall it's free of shovelware. Light, big screen, quiet and a dual-layer DVD writer. Gotta like that! For the price, I can't imagine doing better.Toshiba Satellite A135-S4527 15.4"" Notebook PC (Intel Pentium D Processor T2080, 1 GB RAM, 120 GB Hard Drive, SuperMulti DVD Drive, Vista Premium)"
2,Excellent Album,"Although this will probably go under the radar screens of most listeners seeking out the next ""postpunk"" sensation from Brooklyn or garage rocker from Detroit, Wolf Colonel (aka Jason Anderson) has released one of the most memorable albums of the year. From start to finish, every song is well crafted and extremely honest. Many songs may recall GBV circa Bee Thousand, but to call the songwriting derivative of Pollard's would be a mistatement. Although the songs are short and have a heavily impressionistic feel, the lyrics are filled with everyday observations and feelings, as opposed to consisting of random words strung together melodically. Highly recommended for fans of The Microphones."
2,Big Snoop Dogg is Back,"Snoop Dogg is back and better than ever. He's made his own record label, forget about his No Limit Days. Dogg House Records and Dr Dres Aftermath will soon be the best record labels out there. As for the Eastsidaz, they've got a lot of talent as well. This is a great CD if you like Gansta Rap. So represent Hip-Hop and get Easidaz."
2,TYPE OF ACTION/DRAMA THEY DON'T MAKE ANYMORE!,"A newly appointed NYC police captain, Rourke, has decided to go after the chinese mob all by himself. John Lone plays the young chinese mafia lord, who wants to depart from traditional ways, in order to claim his place in China town. This is Rourke's best performance since 9 1/2 weeks. This movie has good dialogue, good and realistic action scenes, and a good pace. Is good to see a movie where you can see that research was done in order to portray accurately the chinese culture, from funerals, to clothing, to social relationship. Not to be missed."
2,"Insightful, nice and fast",It's a great book for somebody who has done taiji for a while and needs to expand his knowledge on the theory. The conditions of the book were nice and the shipping super fast.
2,A must for high-tech trade show visitors!,"A wonderful, funny guide to those big technology shows that populate Las Vegas. If you're going to Comdex as a visitor, get this one!This book isn't designed to help exhibitors get more out of their show, but exhibitors will learn ways to keep themselves entertained after the show closes.While the book uses the title ""Guerrilla"", it's not part of the series of Guerrilla Marketing books by Jay Conrad Levinson.Get the book and get ready to laugh!"
2,Review of Indian Crafts and Lore,"I have had this book since I was a child. The drawings are well researched and presented. The instructions for the craft projects are not what a Indian would do to put together the items presented. However, it is and excellent starting place for young people just getting started in Native American Craft work."
2,Literary potato chips,"These books, as mentioned in the title of this comment, is like literary potato chips. You don't get much out of the darker than the normal Connelly passages that this novel takes you through, but then again, you keep on reaching for that next page, much as you do another potato chip. And when you are done with the book and and realize that you also have an empty chip bag, there is that sensation of ennui."
2,Worth it.,Haven't had my bike stolen yet; so I think it's a good buy. Good for just locking a single bike.
2,Just as good as the first book.,"In this second book of the Mitford series, Jan Karon reintroduces us to our favorite cast of characters and throws in a few new ones. Father Tim is up to his eyeballs with his dog and Dooley, the boy we met in the first book. Add to the mix a rich widow who makes no bones about the fact that she herself has her eye on Father Tim. The whole mix makes for another wonderful adventure in Mitford."
2,Best Movie EVER!!!,"This movie is a modern version of Snow White. This movie is well played and they couldn't have chosen a better cast for this movie. Anybody from teens up will enjoy this movie. Mild party scenes, and some language, but still an awesome movie. Can't find ANYTHING wrong with it."
2,Hunid in the Low Country,"As I live is a very humid part of the country, the TM005X is very useful product as I need to control the humidity in my home and garage. While I find the product useful, I have not found Honeywell TM005X to measure humidity very accurate. Watching the reading of the two remote sensors, the Honeywell TS33C, and the main unit in the same spot, none read the same and none agree with two other Acurite hydrometers that do read consistently the same. The Honeywell readings very over a range of 5 percent. I called and asked the manufacturer whether I had defective units and they said no, their TM005X and TS33C products readings will vary. I think they should be more accurate. The temperature readings all agree."
2,Power Center,"Great product, exactly what was needed, If I had to buy another one I would buy it again. Price was reasonable and worth every penny."
2,Getting better with age,"I enjoyed Spike when it first came out in the late eighties, but then lost interest in it. It shuffled to the backwaters of my collection and was on deck a couple of times for re-sale. I'm glad it never made it to the used CD shop. I've recently given this a couple spins and have rediscovered a fine album. Spike features some of Elvis' best arrangements and most pungent lyrics (no small feat). Stylistically all over the map, this is not an easy disk to digest, but several tracks such as Let Him Dangle, Tramp Down the Earth and God's Comic are true classics of Costellian proportions. The Dirty Dozen Brass Band adds spice to the affair, while Marc Ribot(guitar) and Micheal Blair(percussion) add a Tom Waits-like flavor. While I do not have the version with the bonus disk, I'm sure that it contains some items of mild interest. Get it."
2,The dark side of the moon,"I must say that this is a collection of some excellent stories, may of which are either somewhat dark, or have unhappy endings. But these are the type that scare us somewhat, because we look into our soul and examine ourselves in a new light.A good read for any time of the day, Harry Harrison's ""Galactic Dreams"" is a well done collection of short stories, whose plots range from funny familiars, to hauntingly frightening newbies."
2,Encouragement for many situations,I am loving the simplicity and wisdom of each chapter. This book is inspiration for personal use or to help a friend. Enjoy!
2,outstanding,"This book is great, because it gives solid, practical advice on handling a preganancy. And not just how-to-deal-with-your-wife, but also the things the man is going through and the stuff the man can actually do himself (saving for college, for example)."
2,It's got all the favourites!,"You could probably get all the songs on itunes, but I still like to have the CD. My kids enjoy boppin' around to this Best of Blondie. Note that NO LYRICS are included!"
2,Economic and Philsophical Thriller,Ayn Rand's book along with its economic and philosophical teachings is brought to life in movie form. The explicit adultery and love-making scenes could have been shaded more. One of a three part movie sequel.
2,As Good As The First!,Three Day Funk is worth the price of admission alone. More raw brilliance and beauty. Lee and Gillen's sophmore album is as good as the debut and shamefully overlooked. By it now and it won't leave your player!
2,Sellers at his best,"Peter Sellers performs wonderfully as a bumbling Indian actor intent on making it big in ""the business."" The birdie num num scene had me in stitches laughing so hard(it's just such a funny thing to hear him say). The only downside to this movie is the ending, which is a bit weak. Still, it's definately worth picking up to watch over and over again!"
2,stargirl 3,"StargirlStar girl by, Jerry Spinelly was a book that took place in Mica. It was about a girl named Stargirl, (Susan) who goes to Mica high school plays the ukulele at lunch on you birthday. Everybody doesn't know what to think of her. Leo and she loved each other. The girl who hated her was. Stargirl Hillary Kimble was a cheerleader for the basketball team and football. Hillary Kimble hated Stargirl because she cheered for the other team.The book was good to reed. Stargirl had some hard and some easy times. I liked it but I think it could have had a better ending. I suggest you to read this book."
2,One of Dickey's better books,"The book started out slow and reminded me a lot of Thrives Paradise, which I did not enjoy at all. Unlike Thieves Paradise this book build you up and did not disappoint at the end. I believe this is a better written book but I think the book that shows case the change in Dickey's written skills was Naughty or Nice that book I really enjoyed."
2,A Joy to own!,"For anyone who loves teddy bear making as much as I do, this book is joy to own! Nancy Tillberg has included page after page of beautiful pictures of her work and demonstrates how to make your own teddy in easy step by step instructions. I own her first book (teddy bears with a past) and find her second book even more enjoyable than the first. A must have for any teddy bear artist to own."
2,Very Happy,"I was super excited how cheap I got this perfume. It smells great, It is my alltime favorite"
2,40 Days in the Wilderness: Meditations for African American Men,seems as the book speaks directly to me. It is telling you how to handle life situations that happens to every black man or any man. I think book is good and informative. It could help you make the right choices in your life by giving a understanding.
2,A MUST HAVE FOR EVERY NEW PM,"""I never really wanted to be a PM but the company recognized my efforts in supporting Widgets XYZ and therefore they decided to promote me by becoming a PM!!"" I am sure most of u ended up like that. Well I certainly did. I will tell you that this job is not easy and especially if u are not an IT background PM, u r in trouble!This book believe it or not I used to read in between trips to Italy before I took this new job I am in. Forget PMI (well don't forget but ...) this book will give you're the instant PM Adernialin u need and it will also manage your expectations of how things should happen. It ahs a people side in this book which most other techs books fail to see. It was allot of fun to read. I have been 12 months on the job now and I think I like it now!"
2,A good movie that demonstrates its own premise,"The reviews for this flick were so uniformly awful I nearly missed it entirely. Even after I bought the DVD on a whim, it sat on a shelf for weeks and I don't think I would have seen it at all except I came down with the flu and was looking for something to distract me. Imagine my surprise when it turned out to be fast paced action film with a great cast and high production values. I'm not talking about a great film, but still very entertaining compared with most of the drivel from Hollywood. I could not understand all the bad reviews. Then a started to get a nasty suspicion which was confirmed when I read some of the Amazon reviews. Apparently this country has been so intimidated by the extreme right in this county that any piece of fiction that is critical of these wackos is rejected out of hand by the media. Shades of the repression of the 40s and 50s! I find it ironic that this movie demonstrates its own premise."
2,I like it!,"I think that the track will be a massive hit for a long time, but the song is just a fraction out of my style. ( Speed it up, and add a massive base line, and I'll give it a 5"
2,Omaha Spirit is alive and well,"""We know for a fact that the Omaha Indians have had a hard time passing on their culture to coming generations, but musical collections like this CD (Omaha Indians Music - Fancy Dance Songs CD) give me renewed hope - the Omaha Spirit is alive and well."""
2,A Dream Come True,This is absolutely what I needed - I travel with 8-10 books - double that when my husband's are added........that's a lot of pounds on an air flight. Now I just have the Kindle......and so far every book I've wanted has been available - some have been free!
2,Hootie Does No Wrong,"The first time I saw Hootie and the Blowfish was in 1993 when I was a freshman at USC and they played a frat party I went to - I was completely hooked! They continue to be my favorite band! Darius has the most amazing and distinct voice - I can't get enough. The only reason this rating isn't 5 stars is because they didn't record my favorite 2 cover songs they used to do (maybe it's a copyright thing) --> ""Mustang Sally"" and ""Love the One You're With."" But I can't complain too much - this whole album is a treat!"
2,Downton Abbey is Addictive!,"I decided to find out what everyone was talking about with Downton Abbey, and since I have Amazon Prime I have been able to watch seasons one and two on streaming video. The show is awesome! The Costumes are beautiful and I am now able to understand a little better about the class system, something we have a hard time understanding in America. There was no crossing the lines of class then, and everyone understood this, until Tom came along. I'm looking forward to finishing season three so I can be ready for the next season."
2,I like it,"i just bought it month ago, it is good until now, but i dont know how is it as a long time device. i hope if they change the colors"
2,Blondes United!!,"While not as gripping as their debut effort, this collection tracks the band through their seven year history. All the essential tracks are here, from gritty to glossy, this collection covers it. Definately a pre-cursor to their latest effort...no.9 I can taste the 80's now!!"
2,Exactly what I was lookin for,This book is exactly what you need to get ready for BCT. The workout program is the best I've come across and is the most effective by far. The only real complaint I have is that I wish there were better examples of some of the workouts. Bottom line: this is the best no nonsense preparatory guide for BCT out there.
2,Loved it!,This tie went perfect on my date. My dress had zebra print in it so I bought this tie to match. It is a silky feeling and fit very well. It also went well with my dress.
2,A wonderful new look at the Easter story,"This book is a collection of vignettes about the final week of Jesus. Sigmund Brouwer takes his novelist's eye and creates an engaging new look at the old story, bringing the story to life in a new way.I also read his full-length novel THE WEEPING CHAMBER at the same time. Many of the vignettes from this book are included in that book, but both books offer original material, too. If you enjoyed this book, get a copy of the other. It is even more powerful then this one."
2,Flying High,"I saw the second title of this series at my local Borders bookstore, and decided to try the first title. Do not be fooled by the ""Young Adult"" category; this book is also appropriate for full adults looking for a good read. Though a little adolescent at times, this novel is still excellent, and I recommend it as a fun and fascinating fantasy."
2,A fine addition to any WOD library.,"This book can add an oft-overlooked dimension to any world of darkess game or chronicle, with in-depth descriptions of everything necessary for running what I consider to be one of the most terrifying types of game."
2,Monster B SDC-1M Digital Coaxial Cable,Excellent cable that I purchased for a very good price. A price that was cheaper (at the time I made my purchase) than some of the cheap cables that are being sold here. I am very happy with the quality and construction of this cable.
2,Try it and you'll get more T_T,"The product quality is tood good to be true, the only thing I should add is that since the fit is almost to your body try the perfect size for you on a normal store...I got it wrong the first time."
2,"Petra Rocks, once again!","I have been a Petra fan since 1981 when I discovered their music after I became Christian. They rocked then and they rock now! This is, by far, the best Petra album since Not of This World and Beat the System. Bob Hartman is back on guitar and has kicked it up a notch or two. John Schlitt is awesome as always on vocals and Peter Furler (Newsboys) on drums is a more than adequate replacement for long time member Louie Weaver. Do yourself a favor and buy this album, you won't be sorry."
2,Extremely well-detailed summary of the game of pool.,"I am a beginner,and I found this book very helpful. It is so detailed with history, tips, selection techniques that you don't touch a cue until chapter 10. My only suggestion would be more illustrations, especially in the aiming chapter. Lots of information, and a great value."
2,Works GREAT!,"I just bought a Nespresso Pixie machine and had the option of buying one with a built-in milk steamer/frother for $99 extra. Eek! I'm sure it would have produced milk froth like no other, but I decided to pass. I found this little gem and tried it out this morning. I heated up milk in the microwave for about a minute, then frothed it. It took about 10 seconds, tops. Viola--perfect latte! It also comes with a nice stand. Looks like a fantastic product to me! I'd also add that it does NOT come with the 2 AA batteries it requires."
2,Beyond Awesome !!,"This show is so so very awesome on so very many levels. The cast is exciting. The writing is captivating. I am a 58 yr. old woman and not usually fond of either the shoot-em-up or the good-ol-boy genre,but I have been hooked on this show since episode 1 of season 1. An American classic in the making.Elmore Lenord you are a superstar."
2,Not a deep dish,"I love this pie dish. It is very pretty and substantial in weight and construction. Nothing fragile about it. I give it only 4 stars only because it's mislabeled as ""deep dish"" and that's misleading. It's not exactly shallow but it's definitely not a deep dish. It's probably just a little less deep than a regular pie dish so to say it's deep dish makes no sense. Otherwise I love fiesta."
2,Quality at it's finest,"I have Nothing bad to say about these pants. I have been wearing this style of pants for work for the past few years now and I would recommend them to anyone! I work in the construction field and see a lot of wear and tear on my apparel through out the year. These pants last me about 2 years on average. High quality materials and strength, not to mention wrinkle free and stay cool during the warm seasons! The utility pocket is perfect for a folding cell phone."
2,"Good product, but perhaps not for me","I was so excited to start using this product after hearing Lisa Eldridge repeatedly gushing over it. I do believe it's a good product, definitely high quality, but it's not for someone with iffy skin texture (obviously, and with most shimmering face makeup). I had a few existing tiny bumps that would catch in the light after applying it, but that's not the product's fault! It's also very natural looking, especially compared to other ""skin illuminating"" products on the market. Now I've just got to work on my skin!"
2,Wonderful Old Movie,"Wonderful remake of a great old movie, You've Got Mail is a delightful updated version of The Shoppe Around the Corner."
2,A MUST,"THe Who Are Sounding Great on this one.Won't Get Fooled Again,Baba O'Riley Are Solid to this Day.Great Musicianship&Tight Production.The Who are in Peak Form here from start to finish.this is the kind of ALbum that is Timeless.A High so High it's Hard To Recapture The Moment Again."
2,On the Same Page,Great documentary...You probably needed to have lived in that time frame to really get it!
2,Memorable!,"Wonderful,interesting, beautiful, memorable and a little disturbing. Really had it all. I give it 4 stars!Enjoy"
2,Pike's vampire is the ONLY vampire.,"Best vampire story ever. Sure, some might argue that some of our blood-sucking heroine's feats are ridiculously far-fetched, but c'mon, it's fiction. I just like that the plot is really fast-paced, engaging, and has a solid foundation. Pike's interpretation of the vampire makes more sense than some other vampire characters. Plus, she could probably kick their butts. The Last Vampire rules!"
2,Grieving God's Way,"This book is written from the heart for those who are seeking comfort and meaning in their grief journey toward healing. Easy reading and numerous short sections help the reader cope with the struggles of the moment or day by guiding the grief work toward healing. Scripture verses, haiku and healing recommendations for grief all in one."
2,good song,biggie did'nt live to enjoy the money he could have made off this cut but puffy and mase was tight on here and plus the diana ross sample made the kids wanna check her old stuff out.
2,"Oh My NOLA.... Spells ""Fabulous""","If you like Harry Connick Jr's style of music, leave what you're doing right now and get this album. Superior in every way. I hope he keeps this up for a long, long time. Thank you Harry."
2,An excellent book despite S. E. Wicker's hilarious review,"I purchased this book to gain some insight into the field of wedding photography after being asked to shoot someone's event. The author provides tons of great insight regarding must-have shots and suggested film and camera settings. The photos alone are worth the price of the book and should provide inspiration to anyone with an eye for good photography. This book gave me a definate advantage for what may have been a life-changing event. Yes, I said it. This book changed my life. There.Yes, the author shoots film and uses Hasselblad gear, neither of which I do. Unlike Amazon reviewer S. E. Wicker, that didn't keep me from learning a great deal. Basic photography terms such as film ISO, f-stops, and shutter speed aren't specific to film users. On the other hand, Cantrell doesn't mention focus, which after reviewing Wicker's work, is something he should concentrate on.Excellent work, Ms. Cantrell."
2,Great debut,"Awesome debut album from an amazing band with a tremendous singer Blaze Bayley. Here even in his early years his voice is killer. Great album, awesome metal songs."
2,Touching story with good animation,"This is the best film I've seen from Don Bluth (and my 4-year-old daughter loves it). The story is really moving -- all about love, death, faith, and courage. The humor works (unlike in other Bluth movies), the landscape (inspired by the dinosaur sequence in ""Fantasia"") is striking, and the symphonic score is good, with themes for each character. Speaking of characters, the dinosaurs really have personalities. A good experience for kids and parents!"
2,solid performer,"Works fine as the standard day-to-day lenses. Wishing for a wider aperature (I've used a lenses with f/1.8 since and can see lots more use.....) but it's performing well.Haven't used the IS much yet, have actually had it off most of the time, but will try update with more info soon.All in all, a solid performer"
2,Classic thriller,"Bette is better when she's badder! I bet she loved torturing Crawford! Then Bette gets a nomination, and Joan gets squat! This is a classic but its really very frightening - to think that someone disabled could be exploited like that. The movie is disturbing, if you're not in the mood to laugh. Bette's make-up alone is worth a look - seems like she just puts another layer on every day, and never washes. They sure don't make them like this anymore - and if they do, it doesn't come out right!"
2,Nozmo King rocks and theres nothing anyone can do about it!,Buy this CD. I'm tellin ya. You better. Or else.
2,desitin rapid relief creamy jar,I bought this as a baby gift-I used this product on my own children growing up-very useful to chaffing. I recommend this product.
2,A timeless take on getting rich ...,"First published in 1910, the firt thing you'll notice when reading this book is the old language. I didn't actually know this when I bought it, and that fact immedietly jumped out at me.The concepts seem a little out there, and at times a little unrealistic, but they work. The book is all about conditioning yourself to think a certain way.Read this book, take it to heart, and become rich yourself.Matthew Overstreethttp://www.swordwares.com"
2,An excellent piece of research!,This book documents the sobering effects on the environmentof the new global economy. It documents a troubling future pricethat our children and grandchildren will pay for the North'sindifference today.An outstanding piece of research!
2,Fun Cryptograms,"The cryptograms in ""Made You Laugh"" are based on funny celebrity, film & movie quotes. They are of the easier variety, and would be excellent for people who are beginners to this type of puzzle, &/or for those who are more experienced to do when you don't want to have to think too much.The only ""problem"" I had with this particular book is that the font size is way too small, making it difficult to write the solutions in above the appropriate letters. It was surprising to me that the font was small, given that there is an awful lot of blank space on each page - so it didn't need to be that small.I liked the x-tra ""gift"" you get with this book - a whoopie cushion is attached to the back cover. I thought this was really funny, and made sense given that this book is a collection of funny sayings.Overall, I would recommend this book to those who enjoy crytograms - but just be aware that the font size is relatively small, and the puzzles are of the easier variety."
2,An inspiration to living the life of a Christian woman.,I was amazed at how this book touched my heart. Kate's struggles seem to be nearly identical to my own life. It is a great source of help to read how she handles different situations in her Christian walk and then apply them to my own life. Easy reading but thought-provoking as well.
2,FIX the Rio 800,"Tech support,I have owned my Rio 800 for one year before any problems developed.And I think I have found the problems.The problem IS NOT the battery as it is.I tested my battery and it is fine after it is charged.The problem is with the software in the Rio player's POWER SAVER MODE.If the player is on long enough for the power saver time to shut it off, the player will not come back on at all- even if you remove the backpack and replace it.When I turned the POWER SAVER off, the player played for 3 or 4 hours with no problems.But when I powered the unit off, I could not just power it back on. I had to remove and replace the backpack for it to work, even though the POWER SAVER MODE was set to off.Which means, the Rio unit is shorting out the battery.(Before, I only had to charge the battery every other day and I would have the player on two and a half hours every day while working out.)I hope this helped"
2,Not Just For Dads....,"This has to be one of the best beginning cookbooks I've seen! I'm not a beginning cook by any means, but I definitely learned a lot! It covers all the basics: different ways to prepare eggs; explanation of different varieties of pastas, wines, and cuts of meat; ways to prepare veggies; etc. The illustrations were great! A lot of the recipes also had suggestions for variations that I thought were great. I check out a lot of cookbooks at the library and just write down the recipes I want to try, but there was WAY to much in this I just had to buy it!!"
2,Fancy steppin' out to Angelucci's?,"I've already reviewed this album once, but here's an extra rock 'n' roll pilgrimage tip for those of us lucky to live in London:If you fancy ""steppin' out to Angelucci's for your coffee beans"" in the Wild West End, you can: - Angelucci's is still there, On the corner of Frith Street and Old Compton Road, just across from Ronnie Scott's - and it still sells the best coffee in London.But not for much longer - Mr Angelucci is thinking of his moving shop (which has been there since 1929) to Barnet in North London. Mister Knopfler doesn't come by so much any more, I guess.Now, some people here have expressed the opinion that Knopfler isn't much good live. In Shea Stadium, perhaps not - he isn't exactly Freddie Mercury, after all. But anyone lucky enough to have seen him in a small venue, playing the roots blues he is inclined to do these days, will know how good he really is.Very."
2,Love them,"Not much to say. The album is great, shipment was super quick, quality of item rec'd was just as stated."
2,"Good, Creepy Fun!","Been quite some time since I read a book that actually gave me that dark, creepy feeling. The setting is eerie and the story itself set at such a pace that you'll want to read the whole thing in one sitting."
2,A lot of fun,"While not exactly the most serious philisophical work available, this book is entertaining and enlightening. A good choice for someone just being introduced to philosophy or for a more experienced reader looking to have some fun after a few works by Cont or the like."
2,"Surprised, but in a good way","I really did not expect to like this book. Based on the reviews and my own impression of Sarah from the first book I really didn't think she had much to offer. Boy, was I wrong. I found her funny and engaging. She and Sam turned out to be a great match. I like how ths ""fragile"" heroine turned out have a surprising skill that saves the day in the end. It made me smile and almost proud of her. Good job Jodi Thomas."
2,Instant movie,Very clear. No lags. Good movie. We enjoyed it. We love being prime members it is so convient to rent a movie form your couch and get dvd quatily watch.
2,FujiFilm FinePix Digital Camera 2650,I had been using my Fuji fine pix for camping fishing and everyday picture taking and I really enjoy using it. The pictures can be copied to my computer then I photo copy them for family and friends. I highly recommend this camera. You won't go wrong! The pictures can also be sent to family and friends through email if they have a computer. This is where I photo copy all my pictures for my parents.
2,Interesting,This book does shed some light on previously little known topics. It is a book that must be read carefully.
2,FINALLY,"This edition is the DVD they should of released years ago ! It contains more gore and loads of special features which show Arnolds charismatic personality.One problem i had with the DVD was that i would of really appreciated if they tried and fixed up some of the errors (like the big shoot out at the end you see people jumping off springboards EVERY time a grenade is thrown, plus when building explode you can see that the bad guys are just scarecrow looking figures that are being held up by planks of wood ) i know these elements add to the charm of this B grade classic but if they could fix up Highlander of all movies im sure they could fix this movie up.... PLEASE"
2,Silent Running,I saw this when I was kid. Nice story and excellent use of FX. I appreciated the fact it was another CGI movie.
2,"Forget death, forget taxes","Reading this book is, I feel, an unspoken duty of all peoplewith any interest in what allows them to live. Unlike some readers, Iinterpret Abbey's vision of the best lifestyle as a balance between roots (nature) and future (society). He is not a Luddite, nor is he an anarchist. This book offends many due to its strong views (name one person that made a difference about something they were ambivalent over). The key to understanding Desert Solitaire is; (yes here comes the platitude); keeping an open mind. There is no better way to phrase it."
2,"Great cage, adorable slide!","My hamster absolutely loved this cage, and spent almost all of his time here (his setup included 2 cages connected, and this one was by far his favorite, despite being smaller). Like some others have mentioned, he decided to make his nest in the wheel instead of using it as an actual exercise wheel. So, you need to buy a different wheel to attach (about $10).However, the wheel comes apart very easily and is extremely easy to clean -- yes, maybe a small child would need help taking it apart, but that is the case for this entire cage, not just the wheel. It is relatively simple to take apart otherwise. Any parent who wants their child to be able to clean a cage completely on their own should look into buying a more simple, easy to assemble cage (like a one-piece clear cage).Overall, this is a great, fun cage for hamsters and other small pets. It is worth buying just because it is so cute to watch the critter run up and down the slide!"
2,Aquarium cars,The boys love watching fish and this railway car was just perfect. Bright blue color with fish of different colors. Look like fish bowl in a train. Good price
2,Some excellent ideas and techniques,"Well let me say first why I didn't give this book 5 stars: Too little written on CF compnents and too much on WDDX. I realise that the book was written several years ago, but it definitely needs a revision.Now, let me tell you why I didn't give it 3 stars: As a ColdFusion programmer for a number of years, there's very little written in book form for advanced CF programmers. So I do recommend this book if you are, like me, a programmer that came from another field into programming through ColdFusion and want something that gets into a little more than just connecting to a database and spitting out some data. However, if you have a programming background in other languages you may find this book to be a little boring."
2,"Enjoyed by my 4,6 & 8 year old",Provides great physical work for the kids while entertaining them at the same time...Even better if you get two as they can compete against each other. Great Deal!!!
2,Commache Moon-DVD,"Excellent! Follows the story line of the book, with a few deviations. Good finish to the rest of the collection, which I have."
2,"I love Riverdance, Lord of the Dance, and anything Irish",I love Irish dancing and i think there should be alot more of it. Im an Irish dancier and I cant tell you how much i enjoy it.
2,Review of Mastering The Universe,The Book is an amazing read for fans of He-Man as well as people who would like to know more about He-Man's creator Roger Sweet. The book also gives the reader an inside look at the toy making industry.
2,Classic Old School for the wrestling collector,"Another great VHS tape by WWF Coliseum Home Video. The main feature of the video being the Macho Man Randy Savage is a plus. Even if you aren't out to collect all the old videos, this one would be worth picking up for any wrestling fan."
2,Good Sega Game For Young Kids.,"This game is designed for young kids in mind, you're young child with play a person who is new on the job and there a guy to help them through it. it'll probably bore adults, but kids will loved it and it's easy to play not hard. your child will be in the driver seat of a bulldozer, a truck and think there's a few other things but it's been awhile since i've played it . plus there humor in it, so the game does'nt take it's self too seriously .Highly Recommended Game For Kids 4 And up."
2,MUST HAVE,This CD is good from start to end. The unique style and ill tracks make you want to leave the Cd on repeat.
2,Tempting Faith: An Inside Story of Political Seduction,"This book was very well written and most informative of the working of the White House and various individuals in Washington, D.C."
2,Don't miss the online lecture for this book as well,"I'm a hypnotherapist in private practice, and I use the theory outlined in this book as part of a therapeutic approach to understanding my client's behaviors and motivations. The E&P; theory is not just for relationships, but can be applied to the base drives that form our behaviors, out outlook on life, and our personality.If you visit the webpage www (dot) understandingmyrelationship (dot) com you can get a really valuable survey of just what it is all about.How powerful might you feel upon hearing your own behaviors and beliefs laid bare and explained? The power to understand and then, to adjust and avoid the pain points. Give it a try. I think you'll find great value in it."
2,Easy does it,"I love this little kitchen helper. When you don't want to set up your big food processer this works great easy to use, easy to clean up,doesn't take up a lot of room and comes in so many colors. I liked mine so much I got one for my son. My daughter has one in silver mine is red and my son's is pink for his new daughter. It's great for cutting up thing small enough for the baby to eat. It's quick ,easy and a great price"
2,Abrasive Plumbrs Cloth works great!,Used it on bathroom tiles and toilet to remove hardwater stains. Took me no time at all and the tub and toilet sparkle. I'm glad I found out about this stuff!
2,Un examen breve y hermoso al mejor poeta de lengua ingles,"Este pequeño volumen, además de tener un precio más que conveniente, ha demostrado, a pesar de su brevedad, contener las composiciones poéticas fundamentales de T.S. Eliot, tal como la Tierra Baldía (Waste Land) y la Canción de Amor de J. Alfred Prufrock. Por ello lo hacen un volumen imprescindible para la lectura de uno de los máximos representantes de la poesía en lengua inglesa del siglo XX, T.S. Eliot. Una posibilidad de revisar poesía maestra a un excelente precio y con una buena calidad de impresión."
2,A Favorite,Nat King Cole is a favorite artist of mine. I loved this CD and would readily suggest it to anyone who love Christmas Carols. His exceptional voice always touch my heart.
2,Nice so far..,I bought this snow to use in my Christmas village next Christmas as well as misc. Christmas art projects. I haven't opened it yet and probably won't til the end of the year but it looks good through the bag. It looks to be the perfect size and glistens like freshly fallen snow. I can't wait til next Christmas!
2,No Disappointments,Not a disappointment in any form; R. Carlos Nakai at his finest and William Eaton's accompaniment greatly accented Nakai's talents. Peaceful music at its best.
2,"Hot bottom! I love it, but the kitten hates it!","Well, I have to say, I think the product is a great idea. I love the fabric, and if you sit on it on a cold day, it really will heat you up. Unfortunalty, I didn't buy it for myself. The problem, according to Lucy, is that it crinkles (makes noise) when you step on it, and it scares her! Pretty silly. I am hoping that in the future she will use it. If not, my mom is getting a pug puppy, and I am sure she will love it!"
2,Good product!,The Shoo Goo arrived quickly and has done a great job repairing three pairs of shoes that I would have otherwise had to throw away! Thank you!
2,Enemies of the System - SciFi tackles politics,"Aldiss subtitled his book "" a tale of homo-uniformis"" and this is telling. The book tells of a group of overcivilised spacefarers marooned on a planet where people from their mollycoddled society have been marooned and subsequently gone wild.The 'natives' represent all the vibrant savagery and anarchistic creativity that the visitors have lost in their over organised, overdeveloped culture.The two different ways of life meet and interact, with challenging results, both sides leave the transaction changed and shaken up.This book examines themes relevant to our modern civilisation and the way that we may often feel lost when we come into contact with a simpler, more ""primitive"" way of life.The ending is typically Aldiss and satisfying, although I won't tell you what happens..."
2,A delightful summer escape,"Be sure to pack An Italian Affair in your suitcase this summer. I found the second-person, present tense voice a bit distracting at first, but I was quickly drawn into the story and stayed up late on a camping trip, reading by flashlight. Laura keeps the focus on the magical places the lovers visit and their feelings, not on the sex. Laura, although self-deprecating, has an inner strength and pride, and her lover at times displays a surprising wisdom about life. A quick, uplifting read. Enjoy this book with a good glass of wine, wherever your travels take you this summer!"
2,Meets my expectation of a Nikon product,Well priced and works beautifully. No complaints - does exactly what it said on the tin.
2,Awesome for true Who fans!,"I loved this documentary because I grew up hearing these songs blaring from my brother's bedroom, and it's awesome to hear Pete Townshend and all the others discussing the concept behind this album. I was glued to the television while watching this DVD; I didn't want to miss a word, especially when Pete was talking. But then, I'm an aging musician myself, and I miss the old-school days when bands were striving to be different and tried to create something truly new and world-changing. ;-)"
2,An artist at work,"Friedman upgrades seamlessly from The Lexus and the Olive Tree. He has the uncanny ability to make complex inter-dynamics widely accessible and understandable. This book is a thoroughly enjoyable read and is going to be the must-read of the year, if is isn't already!"
2,HE ONLY GETS BETTER,iAM A LISTENER OF STINGS FROM THE POLICE UNTIL NOW AND .THIS ALBUM IS BT FAR MY FAVORITE . iT'S ALL THERE AND IT'S ALL GOOD NO GREAT. PERFECT SETTING THIS GUY IS A MASTER AT LIVE PERFORMANCE. i TAKE MY HAT OFF TO HIM THANKS FOR THE MUSIC STING. i'M OUT MARCUS
2,The Everything Remote,"This remote was easy to set up and even easier to use. The ability to macro tasks, such as ""Watch a DVD,"" or ""Listen to a Record"" make even your most complicated electronics available to your guests. If you are cooking dinner, you can just tell them to hit ""Watch a DVD"" without skipping a beat. They get to watch Master & Commander and you don't burn the pudding.The thing I like most about this remote, however, is the ability to customize every button. I like being able to control most (if not all) of the settings for each device with one remote, in any macro, i.e. changing the contrast on the TV, the sub-woofer settings on the A/V, and the Progressive Scan settings on my DVD player all while ""Watching a DVD.""Ultimately, time will give the final review for this remote. If, indeed, I am able to use it with each new device that I purchase for many years to come, then the small investment I made early on will pay off 100 fold."
2,"saves your back, supports the babe, everyone happy!","if you adjust the straps to your height well, you shouldn't have any issues. supports the baby, and if you're on your toes (figuratively), if the baby slips, you'll catch him by holding him up. he'll spin a little, but par for the course. i love that he feels secure and can plow ahead comfortably without fear of really falling. hold on loosely to continue to teach him balance, and tighten up if he falls (don't hold him up while he walks or he won't learn how to balance himself). great buy."
2,Thoroughly enjoyable read--totally engaging!,"As a mystery lover, Edie Claire's Never Buried was the best I've read in a long time. The story has everything a mystery buff could want--an old house filled with secrets, great characters who are like old friends and a dead body in the backyard hammock! You will be hooked from the first page, fill your coffee cup and sit back to enjoy this one!"
2,Sensational,"This book is a pure joy. Dense with information about the planning and machinations of putting this extraordinary musical together from 1969 to '73. We get a real insider view of the recording industry at the time, and their trepidation at backing such a monumental and controversial project. Author Ellis Nassour had unique access to Rice and Webber, and their many quotes and opinions fill the 242 pages. Refreshingly, it is not a hagiography, so explores the frustrations and missteps along the journey from hit single to the bizarre Broadway production. An interesting inclusion is a detailed account of the staging of that Broadway production, scene-by-scene. Packed with never-before-seen b&w photographs, this is a rich record of this phenomenon of the 1970s. I cannot imagine anyone who loves this unique Rice/Webber concoction not loving and cherishing this book."
2,If Jesus Came to My House,"I read this book to my daughters years ago and they still recite lines from it. Now I can give it to grandchildren and children being baptised. It is a wonderful account of exactly what the title says, but, even better, the child says he/she would be kind and do what the Christ Child would do even if he doesn't come. A good follow-up on this, but harder to find, is ""If I'd been Born in Bethlehem."""
2,My favorite Christmas book,"I read this book EVERY Christmas as a kid. The drawings are fun, the characters are heartwarming, and the whole story is right in line with my feeling about Christmas. I highly recommend this book for your child."
2,Good sound quality but fragile,"These earbuds fit nice and snug helping to eliminate ambient noise. They need to be broken in to sound their best, fresh out of the box they can sound a bit tinny and don't expect a thumping bass. I was fairly happy with the way they sounded after the break in period, the sound was fairly clear, the mid range was decent as was the top end.Downside, these things are fragile. Mine malfunctioned after only moderate use due likely to frayed wiring and the thin cables pass on external noise from rubbing and movement. So make sure you buy these from a reputable dealer with a good return policy."
2,"A sharp and biting criticism of ""American Dream"" propaganda","Lucas Guevara is the English translation of the first Spanish-language novel of immigration to the United States. Written by Colombian emigre Alirio Diaz Guerra, and originally published in 1914, it tells of Lucas Guevara, a man who arrived in a country filled with selfishness, poverty, greed, and the pleasures of the flesh. Succumbing to the criminality surrounding him and within his own soul, Lucas descends into depravity, preys upon others, and becomes a living reflection of his morally barren environment. A sharp and biting criticism of ""American Dream"" propaganda as telling today as it was nearly a century ago, Lucas Guevara is highly recommended reading and enhanced for contemporary readers with an informative introduction by Nicolas Kanellos and Imara Liz Hernandez."
2,Cheap and quiet. Not powerful,"This came at a too good to be true price, (less than $4) and delivered better than expected. It's small, light weight, the speed adjuster works fine, the adapters and screws are just enough to get the job done.This fan is almost silent. Like sub-20 db. At the highest setting you can hear a faint buzz but at mid and low it's like it's not even on.That being said, I had to give this a 4 star review because with that fan silence comes a price. Low air flow. This is not the fan you want to choose for a CPU cooler, this is better suited for an extra case fan mount that isn't doing anything.Quiet, weak, cheap. Hey 2/3 ain't bad."
2,nice product,"i bought this for my stepson's birthday so he would stop stealing household items to use in his battles with imaginary enemies around the house. its good quality, good weight to it and nice finish on the wood. definitely an outside toy, because i dont want my next review to be for new lamps. he plays with the tube it was shipped in as often as the bo staff itself. 2 for 1, works for me."
2,Great book! A must have for any SERIOUS gardner.,This book is a must have for anyone who wants to take gardening to the next level. Truly a must have!
2,Wonderful,"This is an absolutely fantastic CD! You can hear Stevie Wonder, Donny Hathaway, Terence Trent D'arby and Prince influences throughout the collection. It is wonderful to hear true R&B once more w/o sampling! This is a MUST BUY!"
2,"Kop min skiva, den ar stabil for fan","Har du hort min musik? det funka! det ar stabilt som fan, det funka"
2,Awesome!,"This CD was worth every dime! It seems like just about every song is a hit.Even songs that I was not familiar with grew on me so quickly, like 'The Gap'.This music brings back great memories of the 80's for me.Great dance & workout music.This is one of the best!"
2,A good book for the scientific reader,"this book is the best. if you in to fantasy and like facts, this is the book for you"
2,"If you like Bay of Kings, you'll like this one","A good follow up to Bay of Kings (in fact, this one and Bay of Kings makes a very good 2 CD set). Very mellow, original classical style music from a great guitarist. Hackett has such a feel for all styles of guitar and is successful in this effort in communicating his love for music and his instrument. Simple production ... just the guitar and a few complementary instruments ... only a master musician could pull it off. Hackett does.I really like Hackett's progressive/electric side, but I am appreciating more his versatility of late. If you only like the harder/progressive side of Hackett or if you have no love for classical guitar, don't get this one.If you like very good original classical style guitar, try this one for sure."
2,Great article about leadership and management,Classic article from John Kotter about the difference between leadership and management. I agree with Kotters assertion that the two are different and needed for a successful organization. I have used this article multiple times at work with leadership teams to talk about how to be more effective. Highly recommend to anyone interested in learning more about leadership.
2,This is a great case!,"It's kind of fun because my son actually thinks it's fun to put his puzzles away now. He's more inclined to play with them and they're educational! But most of all, it's very durable and a definite necessity for storing puzzles. It might be a good idea to go with the bigger one, though. 8/11 of our puzzles fit. The other 3 sit on the top."
2,Solid Performer,"I agree with the other reviews here. This is a great lens, especially for the money. While focus hunts a bit in low light, the lens otherwise performs very well. The VR, in particular is amazing. I have a lens with the previous iteration of VR and the new VR is much better in actual use. I regularly use it hand held at the 200-300 range and have been very pleased with the results. Can't go wrong with this lens."
2,Surprisingly Standard Commissioned,"Let me be honest. After Montell and Marvin left the group after Irreplaceable Love, I thought my boys were finished. My heart greatly yearned for more Commissioned and I was resigned to the fact that I wasn't going to get it. Then here comes this album. I was still a little skeptical(why I don't know), because of the two new members. However, these guys did it once again. It's amazing how the blend of their voices get better even though there's been constant change! Mitchell and Karl are the anchors, and Marcus and Chris fit nicely. The harmony is incredible. It sounds like these guys have been singing together forever. You need to buy this album. ""Create In Me A Clean Heart"" is wonderful. ""Trying Of Your Faith"" is another Commissioned neck-breaker. This album does nothing but further enhance the legacy that is ""Commissioned"""
2,Great product,"I'd tried silicone mitts before and was disappointed in that they weren't form-fitting enough to be able to safely grip a pan. These are completely different--flexible and comfortable.Update: I've used these regularly for the last six years. They did split a bit along a seam, but I easily stitched them up with a needle and thread.You can wash these in the dishwasher, washer (I've never tried drying them), or just run them under the tap. You can't hold on to the hottest items--like a pizza stone--for too long like you could with a a traditional pair of thick fabric oven mitts. Still, these are the only mitts I have, and I like them."
2,beautifully written with well-drawn characters,"The Risk Pool was wonderful, as are all of Russo's books, but I think that this one is my favorite. Russo has become my favorite author because of his characters, which are so realistic and fully developed. I recommend his books to all my friends."
2,"Bloodtypes, Bodytypes, & You","Interesting reading. Lots of little hints, & helps for losing weight. I did find that the list of foods for my bloodtype, especially the meats, were things that I do not like, consequently, I have opted for a low fat, low sugar diet with lots of exercise. I still recommend this book. I have learned lots of things about my health."
2,Eminem is tight!,"Eminems Cd is one u should by, but if u got to be all perfect and doesnt like things that are violent and harsh about sociaty be cautiosh when u by it its filled of that but if u dont care ITS A PHAT CD! by it if u want im just giving u advise"
2,Needed pictures,This was a great book for a child who knows how to read. It mirrors the adult bible. We were looking for a bible story book for our 3yr old grand-daughter that we could read to her and discuss the actions in the pictures.
2,A Must Have For Anyone Interested In WWII,"This book is a true must have for anyone interested in what a GI went through in preparation for WWII. Kennett covers such topics as the draft, boot camp, combat, discharge and even the emotional and mental states of the GI. Such details as what kind of food the GIs ate and how they stacked up as soldiers against the Axis powers is provided.This book would really make an excellent companion or first read for anyone interested in the WWII genere."
2,ENTER THE WORLD OF DARK SHADOWS . . .,"Welcome to the dark and brooding world of Dark Shadows! Jonathan Frid is perfect as the mysterious Barnabas Collins and is effectively supported by a superb cast. The black and white episodes add to its old world feel. The show is just as addictive now as it was back in the 60's when it first came out. Collection 1 is a little slow but hang in there, in Collection 2 the episodes pick up in pace and the story lines become much more interesting. The viewer won't be disappointed. I highly recommend it!"
2,Why can't I put more stars?!?,"WOW!!! Pacino and DeNiro in a first rate motion picture. Focus on characters was excellent, action sequences were hair-raising, and the dialogue was right-on. My wife and I watch this at least every other month. What an incredible film."
2,The Greatest Artist that's ever been sold.,"Well, I love it. But then again I love everything The Man has done. So funky like p-funk, and has almost as much style as yours truly! Buy this album, you WILL not regret it. It's yet another album for us, his fans, those who appreciate him for the genious he is, and the love he makes. Buy it. Peace"
2,Sinatra brings down the House,"Nobody has or had a voice like Sinatra. ""The Very Best of Frank Sinatra""is a fantastic collection. I really like it and you get quite a few songs. I enjoy at listening to it at home, work or in the car. He just makes my day."
2,Charlton Heston is the best!!!,"This movie is wonderfull!! The responsable for this is Charlton Heston, that made a great performance!!! Congratulations Charlton!!!"
2,Garden's Corner is a tale of awakening and perseverence.,"Garden's Corner is a book that everyone should read. The book allows the reader to see him/herself in the characters. It teaches you many of lifes great lessons in terms of family and friendship. Little Speedy Copeland and his grandmother, Miss Pearl, are characters whom you can relate to. Through Little Speedy's encounters you learn that no matter what trials and tribulations you have gone through you should never give up. You should look forward instead of dwelling in the past."
2,Excellent series!,"I was excited to see the Magnificent Seven series over winter break and the seller sent it much earlier than I had expected. Everything was in very good condition. While the DVDS were not of the sharpest quality, I had already learned about this from another reviewer and so, was not surprised. Aside from that, everything exceeded expectations!"
2,A Remarkable Work,Seldom is a work of historical significance of such magnitude written in our generation. The pages come alive with the exquisite prose of Mr. Kailbourn. Tales of those that have come before us are given a new breath of life. This is a tome that all serious students of history should have under their mantles. This is a book that should be placed each night near the pillow as one sleeps. Enough with that Harry Potter twit and how many more letters of the alphabet must Sue Grafton exploit before we shall rise up and say no more. Well then say no more and order this book. P.S. Any relationship between this reviewer and the author is not a coincidence.
2,Book,I bought this for my son for Christmas per his list. He loves it. I got a great price and fast shipping. Thanks
2,Inspirational Book,"First of all- this is one of the few books I bought and could not put it down for more than a few hours. I will admit I'm a bit bias as Richard Garriott is one of my personal heroes in life. But added surprise of how Dungeons & Dragon got started in the first chapter really pulled this book together for me as an indie game developer. Hoping to walk in the very foot steps of those mentioned in this book, I found it more as a roadmap of how to plan ahead for my own future gaming company and things I should consider. Without trying to, this book represents the D&D-SCA-Gamer type of person, who wishes to escape the mundane world around us. To live and breathe in a Fantasy world where the possibilities are only limited by the imagination. Growing up in Texas myself, I was surprised to find out how many other Texans game developers there were, aside from Richard. I would recommend this book for any interested in RPGs/Gaming/SCA."
2,let yourself be manipulated,"Read Chapter 1. Finished Chapter 1. Began Chapter 2. Scratched my head. Finished chapter 2. Began chapter 3. Began laughing at the game Calvino was playing with me. And wondering what he was going to do to me next.I would never have guessed all the different roads I would go down as I read this book.You'll fall in love. You'll pull your hair out. You'll throw the book across the room. And then you'll go pick it up again.Any attempts to describe this book any better than this will either not be well-understood or will ruin the effect of discovering it for yourself.If you are prepared to put aside your standard concepts of literary narrative and explore a new experiment, this book is definitely for you."
2,Grex staples,I bought these to use in a Porter Cable upholestry gun. I was shooting into mostly hardwood and was afraid they might bend over and not go fully into the wood but was amazed at how straight and tight they shoot. I am very pleased with them and will buy again.
2,Frustrated,The last time I hooked up my charger to the battary for my 14.4 volt drill the charger got fried. I just thought it was not working anymore but then when I got the new one and hooked it up it fried also. It only took a couple of minutes. So now I have sent the battary and charger back to Skil to see if they can determine the problem and why it would happen. This drill is only used for residential use.Frank Carney
2,Enjoyable and challenging,"I have never ever done Pilates before...but I was extremely interested in starting. After reading numerous reviews on other DVD's, I chose this one and I am glad that I did. I found this to be a great introduction to Pilates, but also challenging as well. I am getting over a hip injury and found this to start out at a good pace that definitely picks up towards the end of the workout. I am really excited to be able to do this routine going forward, and will be looking for a few more later on when I get better at it!"
2,A clear guide to French furniture styles,"Through simple illustrations, this book lays out the periods of French furniture design in a clear, easy to comprehend manner. If you want to understand what you like, and what elements you are looking for, this is a great tool!"
2,Excellent Customer Service,Excellent Customer Service. Fast prompt responses to emails. Very satisfied with their approach to resolving the issue. Thank you for your efficient service.
2,Super comfortable,"Really like my Slippers, very very comfortable and I wear it all the time, even outside and in the garage."
2,Best in the market,I have had Presto pressure cooker for almost 4 years now. Had to replace becaause water started leaking from the top. We were so happy with this product that did not bother doing any research. I would definitely recommend out to anyone.
2,f***ing killer!!,Stilleto is a awesome! Lita is the Queen of Noise and one of the all time great female rockers and an absolute pro! Buy this now!
2,WWE Undertaker - The Streak,"This is a well done video collection of all the WrestleMania fights with Undertaker. Great DVDs.If you missed the first events of The Undertaker at Wrestle Mania, this DVDs will show you whatever you missed."
2,The best tub,"After trying 3 other types of infant and toddler tubs, rings, etc. with my oldest, I finally bought this one for our new baby. I love that I don't have to fill the tub all the way (saves water), but it is still big enough for him to splash around and play with toys. The lying down side worked great for the first few months, and now at 13 mos old he is still loving the sitting up side. Also, there's nothing pressing on his crotch area (like with the toddler bath rings). It's super easy to clean - no crevices or fabric to get moldy.Even with our tiny 5x6' bathroom we are able to lean it against the wall out of the way. When guests come, we slip it under his crib to hide. It is definitely worth the price, as you won't need anything other than this."
2,This is one club I wish was real,"Rotterham Home was where young people went to die. There was a club that met every night and told stories, stories of love, life, or death, it was called the midnight club. One night they made a promise, that the first one of them to die would try to contact the others from the grave. Did it happen? What will happen to the others if it did? Read this book and find out. This was a really good book and I seriously hope that if you get the chance to read it that you will. It is somewhat heart breaking and emotional, but it's worth it. I loved this book and it took me no time to finish it. When you read it be prepared to cry at the end. But remember that it will end happily.Fiction"
2,Smokey Joe Grill,Love it!!!! It was a gift for my husband and he said it was the best gift he can remember.
2,I'm In HEAVEN on Earth!,"The minute the box arrived as I opened it I could smell Caramel. It was too early in the morning and I was getting ready to have eggos already in the toaster. I buttered my eggos then sprinkled a little of this caramel stuff and OMG, so delicious. Later in the day I did make the caramel corn in my popcorn maker and it came out wonderful, no putting in the oven."
2,Bad Picture,"Product is fine, and as usual with Amazon shipping was very fast. Product picture shows with the carry bag. Carry bag for this item is optional. Overall, a handy product for outdoor cooking with your Lodge dutch oven. They should show picture of product set up though!FOLLOW UPSee they fixed picture...great. Only reason I didn't give it a higher rating at the time was that I felt that the product was misrepresented in that the visual appeared to suggest the carry bag was included."
2,One of my all time favorites...,"There's just something about disk one of this double CD: the first nine tracks flow together in a most stimulating and hypnotic way (by Air Liquide, 808 State, Bando de Gaia, et al). I own a huge stack of Trance collections, including others from the Volume label (volumes 1 and 2, Breakbeat Science, etc.), but I've never found anything that switches me on like disk one of this set. Highly recommended."
2,great seat,"I love this rocker for it's versatility. We borrowed one from a friend and had to buy our own because we loved it so much. When my baby was new this rocker was her most favorite place - more than the swing, bouncy, etc. Now, at four months, she still loves. I haven't gotten to the stage that some users are complaining about so I can't say if we'll have trouble then, but for now I love it. My favorite part is that my 2.5 year old can also use it. When our son was a baby he ruined the bouncer by bouncing in it like a madman once he got a little older. This seems much more durable and both my kids love it."
2,Funny and cute,"This is a movie I have to see again, but it definitely tickles your funny bone. It's not a laugh out loud movie, but it does put a smile on your face."
2,pretty chilling,"I have to admit, sometimes I think ol' Bently gets a little too far out into left field. However, I really enjoyed this book. It starts out strong, and although the ending was a little too wild, the rest of the book makes up for it. I would definitely reccomend this book for people who enjoy supernatural suspense."
2,Stunning!,"This takes the original story to the next step and what a wonderful step it is. At first I was disappointed that it wasn't with the original London cast but the Australian cast is just amazing. If you read the book that this was adapted from, put it from your mind, they may have used the premise but it it totally different from the book. I can't say enough about it, it was beautifully produced, the singing is astounding and the cast . . . was amazing."
2,Simply Maddening,"Tracks 2 & 4 on disc 1 are insane - and are also the perfect songs - not perfect electro or ambient songs - just songs in general - a good album to get tweek'd to - also to have sex to - or both at the same time - its just so chill and weird and unlike anything you've ever heard - its pure art - sometimes calm and soothing, sometimes loud and jarring - a wondrous amalgamation of sound, rhythm and vibrations - a fun listen for electronic, ambient, trip-hop, experimental or other fans - i personally listen mostly to metal but i like this"
2,very funny man,"We saw him at a Johnny Mathis show He was so funny and clean, everyone just had a wonderful time seeing him"
2,esential for aspiring haunted house makers,along with the projects in on this dvd the tip give my the guys are useful for building your own Haunted house4 stars because more project would have been nice and a putting the plains on a web site instead of as still shots would have been preferred.
2,Wee Sing Together,"I bought this video at a garage sale for a dime! It was an instant hit with my daughter, who is not quite 2. She no longer wants to watch Blue's Clues or Bear in the Big Blue House-it's all about Wee Sing now! Although it may be unbearable at first for parents to watch, the kids love it! The little girl Sally is a wonderful singer/dancer. My daughter has to watch this movie at least once a day, always wearing her pretty blue dress that she can dance and twirl in, just like Sally! I recommend this for all young children, especially little girls! My daughter knows most of the songs already by heart and she dances right along with the characters."
2,Enlightening,"Reading the Third Advent was an eye opening experience. It was incredibly informative, and is a must read for any person who is seeking the truth."
2,USE YOUR ILLUSION 2,"My favorite song on this CD is Civil War because they talk aboutnot fighting in a war and the reason is that the music is great.Other than that I like 14 Years, Knock, Knock, Knockin' On Heaven's Door, & You Could Be Mine. In my opinion, Estranged isthe weakest song off the cd and is one of the saddest songs evermade. Anyway my favorite song off the Illusions is November Rainbecause it has some of the best riffs ever!"
2,None better,"I first saw this musical in my French class...we were watching it because we had nothing else to do, and on came Bruno singing ""Le Temps des Cathedrales"" and I was absoluted mesmerized by this music and the intensity of the words and the dramatic climbs and outstanding beats... after the first song I went out and bought the CD... I would recommend this to anyone who has an appreciation for music...even if you don't know French... I haven't heard the english version yet, but I'm perfectly fine listening the the French, emotions have no language barriers."
2,Loved it!!!!!!,A great page turner for anyone who loves a good mystery. This book will keep the pages turning while also keeping you on the edge of your seat!
2,It's not spiced up!!,"My daughter received this item for her birthday and was quite pleased because of 3 things: No.1: it's attractive and compact to fit in a small space. No.2: it has pre-measured levers to push for quick and easy measurements and No.3: you add your own everyday spices and not be stuck with unusable ones that ""other racks"" supply. Overall, quite a deal!!"
2,History being made.,"A fascinating book of all sorts of interesting information of this period from work routines and marketing to medicine with it's bizarre remedies and treatments. Did they work or is it just survival of the fittest?Religious life, superstitions and education are also covered from the perspective of being written in the 1200's."
2,Pretty nice,"I have the 8gb version, but it's the same. it's a nice unit at a good price. don't be turned off by the generic or off branding. it has good features and it's easy to use once it's used a couple of times. just get some more headphones and you're good to go!"
2,good little light,"I wanted lots of light in a small light package and this it is.I would have preferred a plastic one as I am going to take it on a boat but I think whatever light you get ,for damp conditions,you need to spray the internal contacts with corrosion block or corrosion x or similar.Also I will put some grease on the end cap threads."
2,Charming Hoodoo,This book is charming and as straight up as magic probally should be. The herb lore in the book gives you plenty of options for similar results using different herbs. It is especially good for folk practicing Hoodoo or Magic in countries very remote to America because you will not get some of these herbs or ingredience in or into some countries. A man giving away tried and tested favourite 'tricks' without hooks to contact him or his sales organisation is always to be respected.Hat's off to Papa Jim.
2,On the TOP of my List!,"I've always been a fan of LOREZ ALEXANDRIA, and I'm glad to find the ONE of her recordings that I didn't yet have.Any true jazz vocal fan who picks up any of her recordings will not be disappointed. Guaranteed to sing you,and swing you into next week.Wish I could see more of her LIVE in the New York area. A true fan."
2,Outstanding,"I have tried many foot scrubs and I have to say this is one of the best. The pumice adds some real scrubing action and you can feel it working hard on your skin. The scent is very pleasant and subtle. It is very creamy and thick and stays on the skin (my last foot scrub was mostly on the tub floor) until you wash it off. The most surprising aspect of it though is that it did not dry my skin and left my feet extremely soft and in no need for moisturizing. It is a bit pricey, but a little goes a long way, so it's worth it in my opinion. I have a feeling this will be my best friend over the summer!"
2,This game is going to rock!,I was able to see a preview copy of this game and it's rad. I'm a huge fan of the cards so now being able to play it on my GameBoy is cool! I also like that I can trade my cards linking to my friends. Be sure to check out the Trading Center in every town you visit because you can trade cards and even do special trades. It's also cool that the game includes Evo-Crushinators of Doom cards and the set offers evolution creatures!Now I'll have to go buy a copy so I can get the 5 free cards that come in the pack!!
2,It's Worth It Just For the Sound Clips,"The TOMMY BOY SOUNDTRACK consists of mostly alt-rock tunes and sound clips from the movie. There's also ""Superstar"" by The Carpenters and that Spanish song, ""Eres Tu"". Personally, I think the soundtrack is worth owning just for the movie sound clips. I love the movie and I bought the soundtrack solely because of all the sound clips included: 8 of the 20 tracks are sound clips from the movie, including ""Lalaluukee"", ""Fat Guy in a Little Coat"", ""Housekeeping"", and ""My Pretty Little Pet"". Besides the sound clips and ""Superstar"" the only other song I really like from the album is ""It's the End of the World As We Know It (And I Feel Fine)"" by R.E.M. I think this album will be enjoyed by anyone who likes the movie TOMMY BOY and anyone who likes alt-rock music and if you happen to be a person who really is into both of those things, then you'll probably love this soundtrack."
2,"If you are widowed this wonderful book is a ""MUST"" read.","Great reading for anyone who has lost a loved one to death. Fern has an uncanny ability to project the emotions of a lifetime of love through the written word, as well as the pain of grief. This book will help anyone, in particular those who are widowed, to walk through the anguish of grief. Absolutely a ""must read"" for the widowed."
2,Great HDTV!,"So far this TV has been great. You really need to have an HD signal to appreciate the picture, however; viewing non-HD channels after watching HD channels is really disappointing. I don't have an HD DVD player, but regular DVD's look just fine on it. It seems that the signal is better using the component inputs rather than the HDMI input, but that might be because I bought a cheap HDMI cable. I looked at four different models in a store before I ordered this one, and this model had by far the best picture when viewing from a side angle; I find the side angle viewing to be impressive now that it is in my home. The built-in speakers give excellent sound and volume. I now have two of these TV's in my house and am quite happy with them."
2,"Great Dexter, but Bud...","I have no disagreement with the other writers about mr. Gordons awesome tenor power, but I would like to mention that Bud Powell is not really at his best anymore on this record. His very reason of moving to paris were his mental problems and problems with narcotics. From mid-fifties onwards he was never quite the same as in 49-50, wich I consider his best years. Untill his death in -66 his playing was at times just plain terrible. On special occasions, like this recording for example, he seemed to cheer up a bit and could at times give us short glimpses of the genius he once was, but other times... The reason I'm making such an issue out of this is that had he been at his best, this record would truely stand out as a landmark. However on this record he was unable to play like he once did. Hence only four stars from me."
2,If you wanna laugh until you burst an artery buy this movie!,"Even if you're not a huge fan of Monty Python's, like I am, you'll still be laughing so hard you won't be able to catch your breath for the whole 2 hours or so, trust me on this one. From my experience, this is one of THE funniest, laugh-out-loud movies there is not to mention that it's quoted very, VERY often by the people I know. No matter what your tastes in movies are you won't be able to help yourself from falling in love with Michael Palin (my personal favorite of the group), John Cleese, Terry Gilliam, Terry Jones Graham Chapman and Eric Idle. I LOVE THIS MOVIE!! I've always liked the groups TV show, Monty Python's Flying Circus, but this is even better than it ever was! This movie has sight gags, inside jokes and some of THE funniest dialogue you'll ever encounter in your life. Kudos to the boys of Monty Python, you've done it again."
2,The one essential album in my collection,"Dag's Apartment #635 got to me in one of those ""Tower Music listening station ate my head"" moments where my friends couldn't tear me away from ""Girl Had it Good"" to get in line to buy the concert tickets we'd gotten up early for. Ouch. I listen to it all the time now -- and have for a year. This is what funk should be -- not JUST the over-fermented psychotropic jive of people like George Clinton, but this honest simple beat-heavy whispered-background-vocals passionate sound that transcends race and goes straight for the spinal cord. Dag got it good."
2,Guitar and a VOICE!!!,"""From the Archives, Vol. 1"" is a great showcase for this musicain's often overlooked talent. Tommy will always be known as great guitar player but it's his voice that completes the Bolin package. Listening to the songs is bittersweet. To hear the intimate demo versions of his classics lets us in on the heart that was Tommy Bolin but gives the listener an overwhelming sense of loss at what could have been.""From the Archives, Vol. 1"" is a great companion to Tommy's two solo recordings and should be augmented with his work done by Alphonse Mouzon, Billy Cobham, the James Gang and Deep Purple."
2,Very Good CD But Loose Three Tracks,"scratch Promises, Losing My Senses and When, you're then left with classic Megadeth tracks. these are oddball tracks to say the least, not befitting of past or present Megadeth releases. Promises almost has a hint of Def Leppard to it. not what i personally want to hear when listening to this great band. 9 out of 12 killer tracks more than justifies buying the CD. 4.5 stars!"
2,Trent Reznor produces a Finno-Uralic folk band...,"...or at least that's what the latest release by Värttinä sounds like. Hot industrial dance rhythms mix with the finest in Karelian chant-singing to make an eminently playable album.The best thing about this album is the Finnish lyrics. Finnish, a Finno-Uralic language (i.e., related only to Hungarian and Estonian and totally alien from all other European languages), sounds vaguely Eastern as sung by the talented vocalists of Värttinä. Indeed, this album sounds more Uralic than Finnic, what with the Mongolian throat-singers thrown in for good measure.If you like world music, buy this album. You will not be disappointed."
2,Awesome black jack and Texas hold'em table cover,"I love this table cover. I use it weekly and have had no issues with it. It is thick enough to allow aggressive betting i.e. throwing chips across the table and not make much noise or scratch the table. However, there are some fuzz balls that have appeared, but I have expected that since it is made of felt. I don't find that a problem, where others may.Overall, I would recommend this for anyone wanting to use a table they already have but don't want to scratch it or buy a card table."
2,Some good Chicano Music!!,"This is a great collection of Latin Rock from the 70's! El Chicano has always been a favorite among Raza. There is some variety here with some songs, straight ahead Latin Rock, soulful Latin ballads, and instrumental classics. In the lowrider or just for listening pleasure, I highly recommend it. Also there is a compilation ""Back to the Barrio"" - rare and hard to find Chicano classics vol. 1. with 21 songs of rare and out of print titles available from Chorizo Records. chorizomusic2003@yahoo.com ""Orale!!"""
2,All I can say it....WOW!,"My wife has never had a vibrator before so I picked this out as a little surprise for her. All I can say is, ""WOW""!!! Without getting too graphic, there are claw marks on the ceiling after a ""successful use"" of this item!! Right now my mind is running wild about all the different ""ways"" it can be used! She told me to give it 20 stars!!!!! Yeah...this is a keeper!!!!"
2,Love the series!!,"I love watching the series and seeing how the aristocracy and the servants ""lived"" and worked together. I love seeing how people lived during those times and how they dressed. Excellent series. Highly recommend it!"
2,Wife Loved It!,Given as a present and the wife got emotional!And the poses look just like our kids! (Currently)Thank you!
2,Micro-Star!!,"I think that this product is very usefull and works well with my camera. If you buy this product, buy 2 at a time so you can do more than 1 person at a time. {Do not spill anything on it ruins quality!!!} This microphone is a new MICRO-Star!!!"
2,Mini Monster Power 2 go,This little power strip wraps up into a neat little package that fits right in any pocket of my manly back pack and the stealthy black color is COOL...what can I say this thing is awesome!
2,Un livre que tous les Astram devraient lire !,"Disons le: ce livre est la principale source d'inspiration qui a conduit J.Texereau à écrire son livre ""la construction du télescope d'amateur"" si on y ajoute celui du révérend Ellison. Il y a d'autres sujets, comme le soufflage de verre et les techniques du vide, l'aluminiure. Accessoirement rappelons que c'est J.Strong qui a proposé aux US les techniques de traitement AR, c'est dire le calibre du gus ! Mais il y a plein de sujets intéressant, entre autre un outil particulier pour faire des lames de Schmidt avec miroir très ouvert... Pas cher et il vaut vraiment le cot et le coup.Charles Rydel"
2,"gimme some sugar baby,this is my BOOM STICK!!!!","This game rules fans of the evil dead films will love this!!!!sadlly if youre not a fan and never seen the films this wont appeal to you.resident evil style gameplay and the humour of the films,and best of all ""Bruce Cambell"" as the voice of ash!!!with chain saws and boom sticks and an Ash one liner button,this game is well worth the money,Graphics are beautiful and the animation hilarious and superb!!Well what are you waiting for buy it and kick some deadite butt!!!"
2,Mew Egyptian,"This is Jacob Griffith, age 8. It's Mew. It's Egyptian.It's cool.It's shiney.It's a promo card.It's cool on the back.On the back it has all of the types, Grass, Rock, Fire, Water, Normal, Electric, and Psychic."
2,It's a great product.,"I bought this product yesterday and I am crazy about it. I bought it for $90 at Circuit City. It is a great product. I like the headphones and the armband, except for one thing. It would be nice if the armband had a clear plastic cover so you can see the song title and press the buttons like pause, stop, fwd., bwd, etc. while still keeping it covered. It would also be nice if the LCD screen had a backlight so you can read it in the dark. The volume is great, it goes so loud! It is so easy to just drag files to the player using Internet Explorer with Windows XP. MusicMatch software is very confusing. I can't figure it out. To convert CDs to MP3 files, I recommend dBpowerAMP at www.dbpoweramp.com. It is a very good product for converting files. It is a free download. It lets you choose many things, like compression size, and the destination file.Overall, this player is a very good player."
2,CARLY,"If you listen really close , back then AWB were in the mix with Onnie McIntyre and Hamish Stuart with ""Tranquilo"""
2,"Very nice and simple, good for low ceilings","It's great, but I wouldn't call it super quiet. Remember that it takes a while after you hit the ""reverse"" button for the fan to actually start reversing, at first the installer thought it was broken. I did have to replace one because the motor was loud and the remote receiver stopped working."
2,simple,"The proccess of finding ones way through this messy period we call life can be difficult and dangerous. Modern day authors such as Robert Pirsig and Deepak Chopra have attepmted to help us navigate this trecherous path with minimal success. However, upon reading Rabbi Steinsaltz's work I found that I was able to see life and mankinds place in the world in a whole new light. Rabbi Steinsaltz takes a hard hitting, realistic look at the topics of sex, love, friendship and death to name a few. As opposed to other so called ""New Age"" authors of our time Rabbi Steinsaltz affords the reader the opportunity for true self exploration revealing both the ugly and beautiful sides of human nature. I would reccomend this book to anyone who has ever dared to pose questions as to the nature and actions of themselves and their fellow men."
2,To hear and smell a battle,"I have read several books of the battle of Chickamauga, but none as factual and well researched as ""This Terrible Sound"". This is by far the best factual account I have read that I would recommend to all serious civil war students."
2,A Solid Spiritual Leadership Plan,"I enjoy the book on many levels. It appeals to the psychological and spiritual aspects of leadership. I would recommend this book to any person involved in leadership, even on the most minute levels. T.D. Jakes has illustrated through personal trials that his God's action plan really works! Great book!"
2,A Shared Dreaming,"Winner of the 2003 Miles Franklin Award, Miller's novel, set in far North Queensland, functions as a kind of metaphor of the tenuous relationship between black and white Australians. Childhood friends Bo Renney of the Jangga tribe and Melbourne academic Annabelle Beck, recently returned to her ancestral home after a marriage bust-up, forge a new relationship based on a realistic view of their shared history. Once having stared into the face of the violence between their two families in the past they are able to set their sites on a possible shared future. The narrative drags a little in the middle section but the latter half of the book is particularly moving as both of the protagonists make discoveries about their past that force them to rearrange their present. I was attracted to the cover because I have always felt a kind of connection of some sort to monoliths. My friend Gerard tells me it's part of my dreaming. Maybe so."
2,Beyonce's a Good Singer...,"... With A LOT of talent- and I wasn't disapointed when I got this album.Although all of these songs were very nice- I have to admit I liked the songs in the beginning, more than the songs in the end. They got my attention more, and they were songs I could listen to all the time. But the songs in the end were more slow, and much more serious- and I guess I kinda lost interest.But, none-the-less, this was a very good debut album for Beyonce to come out with, and I applaud her for doing soooo well!"
2,must read,I can't get enough of Meyer's book I have read it at least three time all the way through and read countless times my favorite chapters (13&14). Counting down the days for the third book. If you like vampire books and love stories with-out the porn (cough-cough-anne-rice-cough-cough) this is the series for you.
2,Aint that the truth,"First things first, hip hop albums are rarely original you buy a sequel because you liked the album content first time round. When albums are original they end up being smacked up space Sh!t that really doesnt make sense. Beanie came back this time and is still the same thug, someone thats been to prison is a pretty fake fake, just like someone reping QB from Miami...the Beats are nice but beanies lyrics and voice make the tracks. The guests on the album, Scarface and Jigga are welcome but the rest of the Roc-a bangers play their parts. Anyone that says ROC aint nice is a god damn liar. The tracks are varied between thoughtful to head bangers. Buy it, if you dont like it return it."
2,Un tributo a la musica de un genio,"Rara vez me gusta tanto un album de tributo a ningun artista. Parece dificil para un fanatico poder asimilar versiones de los mejores temas de su artista favorito. Pero en ""Serrat Eres Unico"" se combina lo mejor del talento hispanoamericano del momento, para rendir tributo a la musica de un genio: Joan Manuel Serrat.Grabado en 1996, el album destaca particularmente por las participaciones de Diego Torres, quien versiona la legendaria ""Penelope"" de manera impecable; Carlos Varela, a cargo del encantador tema ""Esos Locos Bajitos""; y Ketama, interpretando una inolvidable version de ""Aquellas Peque&#65533;as Cosas""."
2,Extreme Potential...,"I worked in one of the bars where Matt used to play, and I'd always say that he'll be the next Stevie Ray. It's the combination of his ability to play the guitar and his ability to write the lyrics that make him unique. We all have to start somewhere, so if you don't see him or hear him now, one day soon you'll hear him everywhere. Keep doing what you're doing, Matt."
2,Thrustmaster Nascar Pro Digital 2,I bout this wheel because i owned 2 other thrustmaster wheels. My first one 8 years old and still being used. I bout this one because i wanted digital. I ask thrustmaster why my wheel isn't callibraited and they said they would send me parts for free. I restarted windows and it worked great and thrustmaster sent me parts. So now i got extras. ... THRUSTMASTER is [inexpensive] and way under rated.
2,Pretty good,"The more I watch this movie, the more I like it. But I didn't like it as much the first time I saw it. I thought it had too much exposition and a few scenes that weren't needed. I think this movie could've been edited down to about an hour, and just combined with ""Revolutions"" for a 3 hour movie.But nevertheless, I still like this movie. And I've gotten used to all the exposition scenes. But the Zion party scene where Neo and Trinity go off and do the wild thing for 5 whole minutes of screen time just stopped the movie for a bit. It was totally unnecessary. It served no purpose whatsoever.But it picks back up later on with a great fight scene between Neo and a hundred Agent Smiths. This scene was great. And the highway chase scene was remarkable as well. And I liked the cliffhanger. It really made me want to see Revolutions right then and there!The DVD has great special features, the highlight being the documentary on buidling the highway for the chase scene.Good movie, good DVD."
2,Genuine Swarovski Crystal Flower Pendant Charm Sterling Silver,"I bought a Swarovski Crystal Flower Pendant as a gift for my sister. I know that she likes Swarovski crystals. When I got that pendant, I knew that I have to buy exactly same for myself. This is a very pretty pendant."
2,Fantastic..Buy all the Erikson you can find...,"I have thoroughly enjoyed each of his novels, and THe House Of Chains is no exception. He continues his unique blend of fantastic, almost poetic prose and uses it to convey the gritty realism of a bloody and violent war."
2,dvd cd lens cleaner/wet type,"Works as advertised,was a little skeptical on the wet type cleaning,but it seems to work great.Probably better than the dry type,as the dry type i have did not.......Go figure..!!!"
2,Good ... but could've been great.,"The narrative is there, but the author too often only teases at the details that are the core of any book about the rich and famous.There's quite a bit of discussion about the very strong personalities in Skynyrd, but again, detail is lacking.Lastly, the writing is at times overwrought, like a fifth grader just learning to write. I hold no grudge with the writer other than to say this story deserved a more competent writer's touch and direction.As for the band, we all know that over thirty years after their plane crashed into that Mississippi swamp, their catalog is still required listening for any student of rock and roll."
2,These are the things that could break a mere boy,"but Paul Feig was no mere boy. He was (is?) the ubergeek -- able to withstand the torments of dodgeball and other rites of passage and emerge a reasonably well-adjusted 24 year old virgin (see the sequel).(I'm amazed at the level of detail Paul is able to recall, but yet I learned in the sequel that he didn't keep a journal until college. The love and support of his parents is also remarkable.)My favorite story was about the bus drivers."
2,The Littles to the Rescue,"The book had adventure, fun, mystery and danger. The Little Family had to go look for Aunt Lilly after she falls from cousin Dinke's glider. The small family must explore the world of regular size people to find Aunt Lilly. The Little Family use a family cat for their ride as they search the forest. While in the forest they meet large animals and other tiny people called tree and ground tinies. The book ends with the rescue of Aunt Lilly and a journey back to their home in the house of the Big's family. I ernjoyed reading this book."
2,loved it,ive been working out to this for two weeks now i needed it on DVD cause my cable company is like way to expensive it came at the time it said it would i love UPS and i might buy more of her dvds i like how shes like come on push it out i like being yelled at by beautiful women i love the torcher

2,Ben Hogan's classic,"This is a classic golf book of instruction by the great Ben Hogan.... a must read for golfers of all levels!First read this, and then go on to other books!"
2,"Great Player, plays 46 hrs with 1 AA battery!","Sound is astonishing.Plays 46 hours on 1 AA battery.Easy use. Plug in pc and draw files to player.Line IN encoding: possible to use with other devices (DVD/hi fi etc).voice recording.Much better than the 20 Gb HDD Samsung MP3 player that could only play 9 hours max, after 3 hours loading.Highly reccommadable."
2,IMZADI - the unbreakable bond - by Peter David,"This book was just what I was looking for... For anyone interested in finding out what would have happened with the Riker / Troi relationship, had it been different, this is the perfect book for you... Stunning scenes can be created in one's mind while reading this incredible book, scenes to make one drool, and others to make one cry... Believe me, this is one book that you would love to read more than once... and if you are like me... I would also recommend the audio tape of Imzadi, featuring Jonathan Frakes as the narrator... I could listen to that voice for hours... :)"
2,The Best Way to Know What Scientology Really Is,"Many people are interested in finding out what Scientology is all about. This book is by far the best possible way to do that. It has an enormous amount of information, answers all your questions, and gives you data that you can actually use in your own life to see for yourself how it works. It's a no-lose situation. If you're interested in improving your own life, and the lives of people around you, this is for you. There's no better feeling than having the knowledge and ability to be able to help people."
2,A Very Handy Thing,"This is a great bread slicer. I like that the base is wood and that the slats catch most of the crumbs while slicing. Easy to use and to empty, too. The only improvement I would make would be rubber feet to keep it from slipping around on the counter. I also think that the slicing guides would be better made of metal, but the plastic works okay. Great item for the price. I'll see if I can buy rubber feet at the home improvement store, then it will be about perfect!"
2,good old classic,"always pleased with DVD's we buy from Amazon, have never had a problem with used or new. We enjoy the old classic movies like Harlem Nights, it's funny and makes for a good movie night with home made popcorn. All the actors in this movie are classic's in themselfs, they don't make a lot of movies like they did, this movie I feel was one of Eddie Murphys best, more serious and not all crazy, good acting.the second DVD we are reviewing is ""Silverstreak"", this is another classic with great actors, wish they were still making movies, it's sad that Jill Clayborn has passed, she was such a great actress, it's a movie for a good laugh, enjoyed this movie, could watch over and over again."
2,Works great!,"This works great, just read the directions for installation and follow them! I had to order a second one because the first time I just winged it and it fell apart. You gotta let that glue set."
2,Great Help for Anyone Battling Sickness,"This is the most indepth book concerning the connection between emotional health and sickness. It is full of life saving information and hope for bringing mind, soul and body into health. No one who is sick should give up without reading this."
2,Excellent Coffeemaker,I use the Cuisinart DCC-1200 to make coffee from different brands everyday. I really like it. It makes coffee taste better.Pro:(1)easy to use and clean(2)useful features like high temperature for making 4 cups or less(3)it has good and consistent water temperature which helps coffee tasted less sour or bitterCon:(1)Bulky and boxy design(2)extremely short power cord.
2,big jake's review,"Twista is one of the fastest rappers I have heard 100% better then Bone .....Songs to check out1 kill us all2 pimp on3 slow jams4 overnight celeberty5 still feels so good6 so sexy7 like a 24If you like bone you really should cop this album and Mobstability,and adrenaline rush."
2,Terrific Tummy Fiber,This product is worth your consideration. Honestly it does work and it is easy to use. It dissolves in water and tastes like water. Amazon had it delivered to me here in Australia in such a short time I was amazed. For most of my life I have suffered from IBS and other tummy discomforts. I have struggled to make sure I take in enough soluable fiber but not anymore. I strongly recommend this product to anyone considering it.
2,Great Combination..,"Great Bebop combination..Everybody knows how incredible Charlie Parker sounds in his solo album, and how Dizzy Gilespie sounds in his album. Now, they combines thier sounds, feelings, and fun into one CD called ""Bird&Diz.;""Good CD to have, if you love jazz..."
2,It can't Get Better,"I purchase this album on vinyl many years ago and wore it out; I also had it on cassette. This is my traveling music I play it in the morning whenever I go on a trip. Aretha is sensational; only Mahalia Jackson tops her. Some will say she sounds a little bluesy but no one really make these songs sound ""soul from the heart"". She bites into them and you come away uplifted. I am an opera nut by nature and I rank this recording with the likes of the American Dive Miss Leontyne Price when she sings spirituals and hymns. Aretha has never sound better and this is one of her best recordings."
2,Magical,"I'm not usually a great fan ofmetal. It's not usually my scene which would explain the lack of that last star.It did take me a while to get used to this album, but I must say, the more and more I commited myself to this foreign, weird bunch of glorious musicians, the more I liked it.The mood of the album varies after almost every track, ranging from the light-headed, slow mood of ""Spiders"", to the ultimate drunkard's ""Sugar"".My love for this LP is neverending and with any luck, the next one will be just as good."
2,I love this shaver!!,"I bought this shaver over 10 years ago and the only thing I have done to it is replace the blades once. I retired it a couple years ago and put it in my travel bag. Since then I have purchased two other shavers, both expensive and both have been junk. I am currently trying to find another 845, but they are obviously out of production. I have never had an issue with razor burns, nor have I had the battery issues that others have had. I have had the battery go dead, but that is after months of sitting. I just charge it up and it is good to go again. I originally purchased this for something like $10 at a discount hardware store. My only regret is that I didn't purchase a couple more for spares."
2,A great Book,Its a wonderful book so far even though i have not finished reading the book. the transaction was great .
2,Very real,There's nothing pretentious about this CD. I would like to be in the room with these musicians while they're doing the music to experience it first hand.
2,"Christine Feehan's ""Fever""","This is the first book in Christine Feehan's Leopard Series. The book was great. You feel as if you are right in the middle of all the action, not just reading about it. You laugh and sometimes almost cry because the story is so real the way she writes. Her stories are so believable that sometimes you forget its fiction. Amazing story, series and writer. Anyone into paranormal and romance need to read this book and all the others in this series and Feehan's other 2 series. They do not know what they are missing."
2,Love love love,We absolutely LOVED this movie... it was by far one of the funniest movies we have seen and everyone in my family can watch it over and over PLUS the sound track was AWESOME. This movie is tons of fun and laughs.... i was soooo happy to buy this movie!!!!!
2,A WONDERFUL ITEM ESPECIALLY FOR THE PRICE,I agree with reviews stating it takes awhile to get going but 8-10 minutes and it's going great. I also agree the noise is a slight hiss. The only problem I had was that I got so relaxed the beep of the timer woke me.I think this is a great product for the price. The brushes are a nice extra.I like the pampering I can do at home with this just as much as going out to spa.--- That makes it a real money($) saver.
2,Nancy goes to look into 1 thing and finds another.,"This book is wonderful. It has two mysteries in one. It's one of the best I've read. It has a great plot, and it neatly draws it together at the end. It kept me in suspense and it was difficult to put away. And if you enjoy this one, I suggest you read Clue in the Diary ,too."
2,A High Quality Record,"Pearl Jam is still making relevant music, period. They're not the same band they used to be, that is obvious, but why would you want them to be? I've never understood the, what I call, ""AC/DC Need."" The ""AC/DC Need"" is a music fans need for the bands they follow to stay the same. To stagnate and endlessly milk the niche they carved in the past. Pearl Jam is no AC/DC. They're ever evolving and challenging themselves to stay original. I commend them for their efforts, and their latest release, ""Riot Act,"" is one of their best albums to date."
2,highly recommended,"very good remote, im not going to write a bible here but it is simply the best universal remote on the market. everyone loves the touch screen, and ive gotten used to it.logitech support is great, if you have a problem, they will write you a detailed response within a timely manner.5/5"
2,"More, More, We Want More","The most wonderful little-known cd I've listened to. The music borrows from celtic, folk, classical and pop to come up with the kind of songs that you fall in love the first time you hear them and yet they are not quite like anything else out there. The pipes and strings give it that celtic feel while Jayne Ellison who sounds more then a bit like Madonna (on a very good day) gives them a pop feel. There is not a looser on the album, but I particularly love Brenton Drums which alternates betweeen sounding like a pop tune and a theme for a Movie about the American Revolution which tells the tale of a girl who cuts her hair and disguises herself as a boy to search for her missing lover and a trio near the end Benediction, Sanctus, and Coventry Lullaby which all have the sound of Church music in the tradition of Bach and Handle but with a decidely pop edge. Now stop reading these review and order your album so they will put out another one real soon."
2,Orbit Sprinkler Rain and Freeze Sensor,Used with Orbit Model #27896 6 Station Indoor/Outdoor timer. Installation was a piece of cake. Any time it rains I don't have to worry about over watering my lawn. WORKS GREAT!!!
2,Compelling and spooky enough to make you twitch!,"Deb is a master at writing time travel concepts. I'm always awed by her imaginative story lines. This one in particular will curl your hair; you can even smell it burning while Luke sits in the fated ""chair.""Way to go, Deb. It's a great read!"
2,Great Workout,"I'd been using the 1 and 2 miles as my main workouts, and was getting kind of bored with them.Then I found this one, and I love it. The jogging intervals are great, not too long, and they're interspersed at the right moments.This is definitely good for variety. I reccommend ANY of Leslie's DVDs to someone who is looking for an in home cardio workout that's not too hard or too long."
2,Wow,"This was a interesting/good book, not a great book, because of the subject matter, a sad book, an inspiring book. Having never been into the drinking and drug culture, it was heavy, and sad to think about those who have lived this life. I plan on having my 15 year old son read the book to let him see where the use of drugs and alcohol can lead. If this can help even a few people avoid this spiral of life events, I believe James Frey will have done some good by sharing his life story.It was an amazing book, and a sorrowful book, to know of the millions of people living thur this. James has come such a long way, and should be proud of himself, I am proud of him."
2,Just a few flaws,"This is a good vacuum cleaner, but it has a few flaws that prevent me from giving it five stars.(1) The handle is flimsy.(2) The dirt cup is way too small. You have to empty it all the time.(3) The upright segment tends to tip over easily as you pull it around.(4) It really needs the optional floor blush to be a complete system. You can order one separately, but to me it should just come with it.On the plus side, the vacuum has good power and strong suction."
2,...,I love the headphones but they stopped working already. I bought them less than two months ago. If they were more durable then they would be perfect.
2,Intriguing......,The most fascinating thing about this novel is that the guy is younger than the girl. I mean it's one of the fantasies for an older women to marry a younger man. I kind of thought the problems between the two lovers were not strong enough for to keep them apart for so long.
2,A real bargain at $.99.....Highly recommended!,"Got this download during an Amazon Xmas special for $.99. Contains many top classic Motown hits by the original artists. You can't go wrong at this price. I did have some difficulty loading it to my iTunes library on my MacBook Pro. I'm relatively new to the Mac and this was my first download from Amazon's MP3 selections, so I wasn't too concerned about it. I was able to figure out my error and successfully completed the download to my iTunes library."
2,Best stain remover I've found,The Magic Wand is the best stain remover I have found. It has removed many stains that I thought were set. I removed a wine stain from a shirt that had been washed several times. The Magic Wand rocks!
2,Timeless,Charles Aznavour has a way of telling a story through his music that is so special and unique. Edith Piaf was that same. What a gift to be able to hear the songs in English in order that I may understand the story!
2,Good but not excellent,"If ure just breaking in the networking field then i would suggest u to purchase this book. Everything is written in easy to understand language and book covers a networking basics. Like other books related to networking this book contains few serious errors as well but if u read the material carefully, u will spot them ;) and if u will spot the mistakes, u know that u understand the material ;)All in all, this book boosted my efficiency at work sooo much, so i give to it 4 pings out of 5:!.!!!"
2,My furniture is safe!,"I put the cover on during the first part of January and we had a 10"" blowing snow over the weekend. My furniture is safe from the elements. It did not blow off because it is very secure."
2,I Love This Scanner,"Hi all, I just wanted to mention a few things about my new Canon D1250U2 Scanner I bought from Amazon.com. On the day I received this product I had it installed and scanning photos within 15 minutes after unpacking. Everything was straight forward and easy to apply. The ArcSoft software for photo detail and applications is great and the results are just wonderful. I highly recommend this unit, it serves the purpose of scanning for all general needs. Thanks Canon,"
2,Catch not really useful,"The grater is great, but the catch basin is not really useful. There will be a mess regardless unless you put it in a high-sided bowl and grate that way."
2,works on my car too,"I slapped this bad boy on my 2006 sti, and shiat it's a bad motha! I took it to the speed shop and had it dyno'd first without and then with this playstation 3 intercooler and the #'s don't lie!! I got 1.7 hp and 2 tq!!!!!!!!!! going to the track this weekend!"
2,One of his earlier works.,Always a pleasure to read Jacks work. This one had its moments of slogging though. A welcome addition to the series though.
2,Very Good Feeder,"I highly recommend this feeder. It is very well constructed, holds a lot of seed, and I have not seen a squirrel get even one seed from it."
2,spoon,the calphalon nylon slotted spoon was a very good purchase. it is great for the protection of my teflon type cookware. it is very comfortable in my hands and i have arthritis. i would definitely recommend this product to anyone.
2,Another great Disney movie!,"Another great disney movie. I love how this has three option, blu ray, DVD and one to put on your ipod or ipad."
2,Good buy,"Though not quite comparing to some other things I've seen, it comes very close. not to mention a considerebly lower price. It does a very good job of more thouroughly emersing you in the game. I would recommend this, as it quite nice."
2,Much maligned but basically good,"I see we have a claim that ""only Revolution by Night was worse"". Frankly I couldn't disagree more. Ok, so Mirrors is hardly ""classic"" BOC, but then take a listen to their early stuff - there is no such thing as typical BOC. Mirrors is not their best, but it has some brilliant tracks. ""In Thee"" shows a side of the band that few heavy bands dare try, yet the BOC pull it off in superb style. ""The Vigil"" has one of the best instrumental breaks ever. It's lighter and less metallic than some people would like, but let's face it, the heaviest metallest BOC album of all is that total pile of crap ""Imaginos"". BOC were at their best being different, and Mirrors is different."
2,Long lasting,This sand paper does a great job and last a long time. Not to bad to align the holes up and it stays put.
2,Like the bag for storage.,These are nice and the storage bag is a plus. I haven't needed to use them so I can't comment of the life preservers.
2,Loads of Fun,"Memories of my childhood flooded back as I read this wonderful book. Lance Marcum has written a book that kids of all ages can enjoy. His main character's (Mitch Valentine) first person account of his summertime adventures is pure kid fun from start to finish! Although ""The Cottonmouth Club"" is a real ""page turner"", it took me longer than expected to read due to my LOL fits, which erupted with nearly every page! Girls and boys, men and women, this book has something for everyone, and to top it off teaches some valuable life lessons. Read it, you'll love it."
2,This is a god CD,"Always searching for just that right song, and you will find it on this CD, full of emotions, that middle of the road whine down and exhale music. Real Music, breath of fresh air music. I'm still a funkateer, so after a mellow time with a glass of wine and India, I throw on my party attire, and pop my Dawn Silva CD in the ride and off to the party a humping I will go."
2,great books for budding artist,"These books are great for kids, my boys checked them out from school last year and spent a whole week drawing these wonderful pictures, even the 5 year old, you could see the story he was telling in the picture. They love all of these books. The ""Make a World"" one has so many things on each page, it is amazing. Each one drawn out step by step. I think it really could have everything in it."
2,Clamps,I love these clamps as it allows me to position my work in about any location. These makes things alot easier to work on.
2,Best Tribe Album Yet!,"This album which steps up from all the violence and stupidity in rap today is truly ground-breaking. The tribe brings their rhymes up to a new level, where they discuss ""REAL life"", instead of bull**iting about their big gold chains, killing cops, and their cars like everyone else in rap seems to be doing these days."
2,Christmas Lodge Movie,It was very family and romantic-type movie. It showed that the living for others and trusting that in a bad or hard time good things can be possible. Very beautiful scenary and uplifting to watch and hear.
2,What a wonderful Book!,"This book is wonderful! It applies to me and all the other 13 year old girls in the world. I recommend it to anyone else, because this is one of the best books I have ever read, and I have read quite a few. I look forward to reading more books by Rosie Rushton!"
2,"I thought it would be good, but it's better","The best album maybee ever, in a draw with follow the leader. My favorite is probably the most poular song on the album, which is obviously, evolution. Screw you all of you haters. I've seen at least 10 people thinking the opposite of what i do. They are really screwed up."
2,Addictive,fabulous....Can't get enough of the show!!!!!!!!!! Hooked all the way! Wish the seasons were longer. 5 Stars all the way around.
2,Easy to Read and Informative,This book was extremely helpful and easy to read. It outlined the two different theories currently used to diagnose and treat ADD. The adult ADD section was especially interesting and informative.
2,Three Women,"Three Women is one of my favourite books. A book that I can read again and again. These stories of three women each of their time gets to you. You are there and you feel you know them, you understand why they react to whatever happens to them as they do. You laugh, you cry, and you rebel with them - and enjoy their personal successes. The stories are finely balaced in drama and humor as the various characters are portraied with a great knowledge of human nature and a lot of self-irony."
2,Good sturdy ball,"I ordered this after reading reviews and everyone was correct. This is a good quality ball that is pretested at the factory by inflating for 24 hours and is probably the reason it does not smell like other new balls. It was the perfect size for my 5' 2"" wife to use as a chair for work. She did have to let some air out so her feet hit the floor but due to it's large size it would be good for almost any size person to use for a chair."
2,More than Great Essays,"This books brings some of the greatest essays to you, as well as provide various reflective questions. This would be a great book to use in your first year of college or if you were homeschooling your child. One of the things I found extremely valuable about this iteration of essays is that they provide a brief history of each of the great authors. This is one of the best short essay books of our time."
2,Facing the Giants,"I bought this for my classroom but I did not realize it was Christian video. When I watched it at home, I thoroughly enjoyed it and would like to use it in my Sunday School classroom."
2,Loved it!,I have never taken it upon myself to read this wonderful classic. I very much enjoyed it and highly recommend it to all.
2,Tool IS the best band in the world.,"I love tool. This cd is there best work. Loud drums, heavy bass beats, Cool and hauting vocals, Tool has every thing every band needs to be good....yeah. I gave it 5 stars but in needs 10. Get it and listen to #1 #2 #3 #5 #7 and #13 for the best songs. Trust me. I know what I'm talking about."
2,Chilren's Book,"I think this book is great for parents trying to teach their children about the importance of diversity. However, even though the book is trying to teach children how to love all people regardless of their differences, I think it is important for parents to teach their children that everyone is unique in their own way, and how to embrace the differences between one another."
2,Latin Party 99,"Very Good Album , very good track list and good Megamix , ideal for the dancing , VERY GOOD BUY FOR ME COLLECTION"
2,FIVE STARS IS NOT ENOUGH,Eugene Ormandy is my favorite director and this is simply the bargain of bargains. Nothing lacking. Well I wish it came in a heaftier presentation case. The music is heaven on Earth. You have never heard classical until you have heard it under the baton of Ormandy.My favorite classical collection period.If you love classical don't go to the grave without this one.I give this one a solid ten stars.
2,Works as intended,"There is much to say about this product.I plug them on my Equus 3320 multimeter and just worked fine.The clamps work well, the plastic cover for the clamps is a little slippery, but is not a major problem."
2,Not a bad song in the bunch!,Awesome! Had this in vinyl and it was never released in CD except in Japan and the price was prohibitive. So glad to be able to have it again for my mp3 player now.If you enjoyed Patty Weaver as a singer on Days Of Our Lives (or the other soap she is now on) you will LOVE this album. Not a bad track in the bunch - they are all good (and how many albums can you say that about?).
2,I didn't like Allie,"Part of me really wants to dislike this book, but I just can't. I can, and do, dislike Allie. What a selfish man! And what a compelling book if it can make me dislike a character this much. The descriptions of the jungle and characters were so detailed and perfect!"
2,Streetglow 9005,"These bulbs burn hotter than a standard bulb which then turns around and creates a ultra white light. These bulbs are amazing, they are a tad bit brighter and they give the vehicle or bike a sweet look. you can not even look directly into the bulb cause it is so bright, unlike the stock headlights in a car you can stare into those forever."
2,TIMELESS AND BEAUTIFUL!,"My husband and I have looked for a watch for me in celebration of our 10th anniversary. I wanted a ceramic watch, but decided since it was an anniversary present, i decided on a watch that was timeless. I love the two-tone band, as I love to mix metals. I wear it daily, and would wear it when dressed up as well. The diamonds are pretty and have a nice shine. The only complaint that i have is that i wish the dial had better a little larger, but is a winner, and i love the eco-drive, yay, no batteries!!"
2,Saint Germain Des Pres Cafe vol. 4,"This is the best Saint Germain set as of yet.. It gets you from the beginning but especially track 3 ""Flying Saucer"" w/ DeeDee Bridgewater. I play this CD and my friends always ask me what I'm lisiting to, that's usually a good sign...."
2,Believe the hype!,"Wow! That was my reaction once I finished this book. I couldn't believe how much I enjoyed it. I had haphazardly starting reading it as someone gave it to me as a gift. Now I could kick myself for waiting so long to jump on the bandwagon!I am simply amazed that someone has such an imagination as this book reveals. It's most impressive. And believe me, I am not one for ""magic"" and/or children's books as I thought this was.This book is beautifully written and really makes you care about the characters. Definitely worthy of the hype and attention that it has received!"
2,Unbelievably Funny,"I know it sounds cliche, but I literally could not put this book down. I annoyed all my friends and family members by reading pages of it during breakfasts, lunches, and dinners. Maybe it's because I'm a New Yorker, but Daum seems so dead-on about finding the humor in so many of life's little absurdities. Yet all the while, she manages to convince the reader that Luncinda Trout is in fact a real character, with a real emotional investment in what has become her new life.This book will resonate with anyone who has ever had to make a major life transition, whether by choice or neccesity."
2,A Table of Grace,"This is exactly what I've been searching for: A large recipe binder with room for all of my odd-sized recipes, whether torn from a magazine or passed down from a friend. This will help you get organized.I ordered this in September, and did not receive until December. I was updated regularly that they were having a problem filling my order. For someone reason, this book was hard to find. However, it was worth the wait!"
2,LCD Wall Mount,"This mount after installation functions nicely. The hardware package while having several additional bolts and screws still did not have the bolts necessary to mount my JVC 32"" LCD flat screen. The instructions for mounting were marginal if you are not mechanically inclined. Overall a good product and the price was very good."
2,More Than Just A Whack,"This book will not only whack your head, but your wallet as well when you incorporate it's principles."
2,back to his roots,audiophiles say his music from this genre got better after he produced this cd. While he toured it was noticable. Clapton is one of the true masters of the guitar and his voice lends itself well to this bluesy-rock genre of music.
2,A Brilliant But Self Destructive Boxer!!,This is a fascinating A&E Biography of the reknowned and brilliant boxer Mike Tysonwith an unfortunate self-destructive mean streak!!It's an excellent video!!
2,Best for limited storage!,We have limited storage so this works great & fits in the sink perfectly. Never have a problem with leaking either.
2,IAN FLEMINGs Japan and the Devil,"This is Ian Fleming's most mysterious and enigmatic James Bond novel. This is a direct follow up to ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service."" It starts out as a direct secret service story even though Bond is reassigned to the diplomatic section. As it progresses it becomes almost surrealistic as James Bond tracks down his arch nemesis on the island of Kyushu. This is a very well written and researched novel. The Japanese idioms and depictions of locale are exquisite. When the novel moves to Kuro Island and is on the threshold of Dr. Shaterhand's castle lair, Fleming approaches mythical horizons. I found this absorbing, haunting and prophetic novel very difficult to put down once I started reading it. You get addicted early on to such charismatic characters as Tiger Tanaka and the all too brief Dikko Henderson but it is the narrative of this epic tale that beckons the reader. The new retro-paperback cover is alluring."
2,From Jessica-asian-tours.com,"The book is like a roadmap, highlights warning signs to help avoid mistakes in an unusual situation. I could have made some of the same mistakes if I weren't very careful. Your book was insightfull, interesting and spellbinding for my Filipina wife and I and it spawned much conversation for us.As a Filipina matchmaker, I have seen Filipina's looking for Stepping Stones to a better life, Gold Diggers wanting money, but mostly sweet girls who are virtuous, loving, family girls.I can relate much to your story. I had known my wife only 6 months before we were married. Luckily, she is my dreams come true. We are very happy after 3 years. I thank God that I picked Jessica. I can recognize that your book also illuminates some of the cultural differencesJames"
2,AMAZING!!!,"A truely realistic look inside a poorly understood condition. I learned so much. A must read to for anyone that has a friend or family member with BPD, or if you are dealing with this condition personally. There really is hope..."
2,Life at Bellevue,"Ziegler writes about the day-to-day travails of the ER staff at one of the nation's oldest hospitals, Bellevue. The book starts off with a wild case: an overturned crane has trapped a woman and paramedics and doctors rush to save her before amputation becomes an option. Some chapters are devoted to the doctors' personal lives, but the real action only takes place in the hospital. Given that the book was published in 1987, medicine has advanced to the point where this book could be considered a historical narrative, but it's still entertaining."
2,you get more than you paid for,"As far as value goes, this product is excellent. The case is actually aluminum. The pouch is nice, and everything is included that you might need down to the screwdriver. It took about two weeks to arrive. I connected the drive, slid it in, plugged in cable, and Windows 7 recognized it immediately. Performance is solid! A GREAT value. I wouldn't say any of the plastic pieces are of ""junk"" quality, but I can definitely see how if you aren't gentle with it the drive could disconnect after assembly or you could maybe crack the plastic endcaps. If you want something rugged to toss into your backpack/briefcase, you're going to have to spend more money. It works great -- and if you handle with a little care it will last."
2,Sheer delight,"I may not be as well versed in the technical end of Disney movies but this film is my favorite Disney film. I originally saw it during its initial theatrical release when I was a child. I maintain that the detail in the scenes is amazing. The clocks in Gepetto's shop are a wonderful experience itself. The detail that was put into these early hand drawn animated features is flawless. I just can't immagine any one today doing all that work on any film. Now all that work is done with computers and although the films look wonderful, there is something magical about an old hand drawn Disney flick. The updating of the film onto Blu-ray is amazing. It is clear and sparkles. I had purchased Pinocchio on VHS when it was released a few years ago but this is a vast improvement."
2,A GOOD BOOK THAT LEFT ME WANTING MORE,"THIS WAS A GOOD BOOK THAT LEFT ME WANTING MORE. THE ITALIAN ARMIES HAVE NOT RECEIVED NEAR THE ATTENTON THEIR GERMAN ALLIES HAVE, AND FOR THIS REASON I EXPECTED MORE ABOUT ITALIAN INSIGNIA AND MILITARIA. STILL THIS WORK FILLS A LARGE GAP, AND I RECOMMEND IT FOR BEGINNERS"
2,Examines socio-political aspects of Middle East on eve of 1967 war,"I came across this book randomly, and loved it. Having taken a course on Middle Eastern history and one on borders, I felt like this book supplemented everything I had read about, and more: it provided me with the human dimension of more broader policies and events of the region. Well-balanced, informative and interesting, takes place on the eve of the 1967 war. It examines the same events through the eyes of different characters: an Israeli spy living in Syria, a Palestinian terrorist, a Lebanese banker and an Israeli military adviser. Wonderfully written."
2,Refreshing outlook,"Andrei's Megacreativity opens up a whole new world of looking at things in a different light. His laws of megacreativity are refreshingly enlightening. Especially interesting are the inclusions of puzzles and challenges. Andrei makes you think at all times, ""Why not?"" ""There must be a way somehow."" He is an inspiration to all who dare to try! I strongly recommend this book to all who want to think differently in a positive way."
2,LOVE it!!!!,"We just got this swing for our 3 1/2 month old daughter about 3 weeks ago. Can I tell you she LOVES it!!! She just lays back and watches the lights and the butterflies pass by. I LOVE the fact that it plugs in! I was getting it out of the box and thought OH NO, I don't have batteries. Then while ""I"" was putting it together I saw that it plugged in....WOOOHOOOO! As you can see, I put it together myself...it was that easy! I was SOOOOO Excited when I saw it here on Amazon for $114 SHIPPED! I had waited a while to get one because I REALLY wanted this one, I just couldn't pay $159 for it so I JUMPED on it when I found it at this price. BUT it would be worth the extra $$...we LOVE it that much!Rachel"
2,"dynamat is the best, hands down","Does what its supposed to, works great, if you got a system, buy dynamat, its like night and day, makes all the difference."
2,Pay close attention to everything...,"This is a great series of books - and I am thouroughly enjoying them, but this 3rd installment is so full of twists and turns, that I often found myself reading and re-reading sentences and paragraphs to figure out exactly how the numerous plot-lines (betrayals) intertwined with each other. What I'm trying to say is that the book can seem as if it was written in fast-forward; you really never have a chance to absorb the story - there's just SO much going on. But I really am enjoying it and will definitely read to next two. I have just newly discovered S.R.D., and he is quickly becoming one of my all-time favorite authors! (At least there's not so many words I've never heard of before, unlike the Thomas Covenant series)"
2,NOT JUST FOR COFFEE TABLES,"As a collector AND afficionado, this book and the Standard Catalog of Smith and Wesson will get me what I need. One size seldom fits all, and I believe it is unfair to expect such from a single book. This attactive edition provides interesting information, very nice photographs, and (particularly neat) two pages devoted to pictures of the TWELVE REVOLVERS and their engraving, AND an explanatory drawing of the triple lock system. There are other books for the deadly serious collectors; this is simply a nice overview with a lot of good stuff."
2,Nice,"It has 2 of all, the music is brutal and insane. This also has music videos, so its a must-buy."
2,One thing that is more silly,The only thing more silly is that some people actually believe his new movie is truthful!
2,For the money? Brilliant!,"It works, it does what it's supposed to do. The crosshairs are fairly thick, don't know why that is, does that help make it cheaper? For the money, it's hard to beat. I put it on my wifes plinker (Ruger 10-22) and it's got her making the pop cans dance. No complaints, but I just couldn't give it 5 stars with the fatty crosshairs. If you are considering this scope, I don't see another issue, just that one really. Nice for the price!You'll need rings. Duh. LOL"
2,Pregnancy saver,"My husband and I bought this pillow when I was in my first trimester. We struggled for a bit with the limited room on a queen size bed but eventually made it work. I sleep on my left side, as directed by my doctor, and my husband always takes the other arm of the pillow for his own, so it benefits both of us.The reason it is a pregnancy saver for me is because I was just recently diagnosed with a kidney problem that prevents me from being able to sleep on my back or right side. This pillow supports my back with one arm while I wrap myself around the other arm. I have 20 weeks of my pregnancy left to go and I cannot imagine trying to sleep without the support that this pillow offers."
2,Excellent Book that gives practical and encouraging advice,"After reading several books pertaining to pregnancy of both single and multiple babies, this book was a breath of fresh air. The author offers practical advice to common concerns of multiple mothers-to-be and writes in an encouraging and thoughtful tone. The information in the books provides such insight as to how to navigate each trimester, what baby products are necessary in double, nursing techniques and tips, what to expect from labor, tips on creating a feeding/changing/sleeping schedule in the babies early months, etc... A MUST read for all expectant mothers and fathers of multiples."
2,Good low budget import,"Rodolphe Marconi is excellent as a young man obsessed with an individual he met while studying art at a Rome college...This is basically a 1-character study with 2 or 3 supporting roles, and a very limited budget; the script and acting are good, but the film is worth for it's portrayal of someone's borderline fall into the madness that unreciprocal love can bring"
2,Just what I was looking for,This has plans that fit what I am hoping to build soon. Kudos to the author for the plans and descriptions of the furniture.
2,A good first person shooter game,This was also a christmas gift. The game has been played often and has been enjoyed. The graphics on the game are very good as long as you have the supporting graphics card.
2,Great!,Very intersting and well made documentary. I really enjoyed watching it. I love Liberace and am always interested in learning about his life. I recommend.
2,Best firewire player out there for [the price],Overall I've been very happy with the Zen (Firewire/USB version).The battery life is good and the menu system is very intuitive.The signal to noise ratio is one of the best.Of course the small size is the main feature. Only the iPod is smaller. But a 20GB iPod is currently $...!Through the Creative s/w you can store non-audio files on the hard drive. This is handy for transporting large files from home to office.The only things I don't like about it are fairly trivial.- The ON button is recessed and can be difficult to reach.- The text on the LCD screen is a little on the small side.- You can only access the unit from a PC with the Creative s/w installed. It would be kind of nice to be able to access it as a normal Firewire drive.
2,A great way for a Corgi to start the day!!!,"This is a great product. Our Corgi dogs love it. They stand in line, not too patiently, every morning to get their vitamin treat. I think that since the guys have gotten these treats they seem more active, and are happiers dogs. I just don't see how you can go wrong with a wonderful food additive like this."
2,Like a conversation,"Mr.O'Reilly wrote his book in a very free style as though he was speaking, so it flowed very well and was easy and enjoyable to read. The things he wrote about Hollywood, the news business, and just life in general confirmed many things that I suspected were true, and he made me aware of some other really ridiculous people and situations. The truth in his very short paragraph about Bill Clinton was chilling. (You'll know it when you see it.) I have only one negative comment--he got a little self-indulgent in the last chapter. His book is well worth reading regardless of your political views, because neither liberals nor conservatives have a lock on the ridiculous. We're all guilty of being a little ridiculous at times, and he points it out with that little gleam in his eye."
2,Good Condition,This book was what I expected for slightly used. It had some underlining in the first few chapters but looked brand new for the rest of the book. I would order again!
2,It's a Wild Ride,"I'll have to admit that I am a bit addicted to the Dark Hunter series. These are not the highest form of literature, but they are entertaining-- that's why they get 4 rather than 5 stars. Night Embrace, as you may easily guess, is a bit of a bodice ripper --- but that element is kind of fun and doesn't take away from the plot. The stories are fast paced and well threaded, yet a bit over the top. Kenyon brings in a bit of legend, ancient history and Greek mythology -- a great premise to begin with. The characters are interesting and compelling, yet a little corny. I especially like all of the ""side characters"" - those that appear for a few short chapters-- often they will reappear in future books of the series. I admire Kenyon's attempt to hit every New Orleans landmark (again, as she does in previous books)."
2,challenging,series gives excellent insight into the challenges and opportunities faced by folks that experience a different lifestyle than the majority of americans at this point in time. sensual and riveting. nice work! i would recommend this series to anyone who is interested in seeing a side of life they may not know a lot about otherwise.
2,ALL TIME TOP 10!!,This cd is what rap is all about its got hip-hop and gangsta mixed to make a hella tight beat. OUTKAST 4 LIFE!!
2,Single's called BLUE MONDAY...,"This single sux! I hope the ""STITCHES"" single has better remixes than Blue Monday. I only gave it 4 stars becuz it plays the video when you put in you computer! All five Blue Monday remixes suck. And for the stitches mix, what the hell is it? Sounds nothing like Stitches! Buy this, only for the video."
2,Great for a boy who loves tractors!,"My two year old is crazy about tractors. He loves this toy. He vrooms it along the floor and loves to open it and look through the pictures. The book inside isn't the greatest, but it keeps his interest. A good buy."
2,Brief But Deep,"Van Zeller does it again here, as he does in his book on suffering, by being concise and deep in his insights. He defines holiness as giving glory to God, and he tells you how to pursue holiness. In contrast to so many of our stereotypes of holiness, he makes clear that holiness is rewarding in this present life and not just in the afterlife. He also makes clear that cheerfulness and joy are hallmarks of holiness. So much for the stereotype of holiness as bleak drudgery. The book displays the deep experience of Van Zeller. You can see that experience manifested in his emphasis on trust in God and abandonment to His will."
2,Truly sensational new edition of this classic,"In recent years the printing quality of this superb book had suffered. Happily, this new edition has restored the exquisite photography. It was worth the wait. ""The Art of Sensual Massage"" has never looked this good! The massage one learns here (apparently updated ) is still the best in any book."
2,Great dual function lens,"I wanted a new macro and telephoto lens for my Sony Alpha 100 but couldn't afford to buy both. But with this lens, a flip of the switch allows you to take some very nice close-up shots and the telephoto focus is very clear for a 300mm. I am very pleased with the performance and the price. I will try other Tamron lens now that I have seen what this one is capable of."
2,Do you feel lucky? well do you?,"Dirty Harry What A Classic gritty movie, Great lines, Great Action and basically a social commentary on how the world has gone down the tubes. Of course I do not condone such actions. But The Scorpio character is afforded too much help in avoiding the rap.Regardless, Clint Eastwood is the MAN."
2,Oh Yeah,"Why do I like Vollmann? Because he never judges a person. Whereas everybody and their friggin uncle are judging him all the time. I admire the writer who can say what he has to say and stand by those words. I've seen Vollmann on book tour twice here in Chicago. The first was for Butterfly Stories and the second was for The Atlas. When he asked the small crowd of students at Northwestern University who had read the Atlas, I raised my hand and told him that the Rifles was a better book. Some of the students snickered and Vollmann replied ""Well that's a good book to."" Honestly it took several readings of the Atlas to finally appreciate it. My favorite stories are the African and Canadian stories. Read this one while you're traveling alone. (Alex Sydorenko, July 1999, Chicago)"
2,Great series - hope someone picks it up,"The Dresden Files is a well-written, funny, solid drama that was canceled due to SciFi Channel's apparent need to get rid of all of its fans. Paul Blackthorne does a great job of portraying the Harry Dresden of Jim Butcher's books. I can easily hear Blackthorne's voice as I am reading the books despite the fact he is British. (That's two actors - the other being Hugh Laurie - that do a great American accent.) The Dresden Files is easily one of our favorite shows on TV (me and my two teenagers)."
2,Great Purchase!,"I have always loved this show and have wanted to buy the collection since it came out. Buying from Amazon was a great purchase - it was cheaper than I could find it anywhere else, even with shipping costs. It arrived quickly and safely. I highly recommend making this purchase - especially if you love the show as much as I do!"
2,watch case wrench,This tool made it easy to remove the back cover in order to replace my battery. I will be pleased to have this tool for future use.
2,Not the heavy duty that I have but good...,"This is a nice hoody, I was looking for the heavy version, not sure if this was the replacement or not. Quality is not as good has the heavy one I have but still good nonetheless."
2,Reliable and easy to set up,"I'd been running a home network on another company's wired router, with a broadband DSL connection. It was functional, but about once a week, I needed to reset the modem, router, and re-boot the computers to keep the system running.The old router was destroyed when we took a close lightning strike during a thunderstorm. I found the DI-614+ and the DWL-650 card on a great sale, so decided to go 802.11.b compatible wireless for only [a little] more than it would have been to go back to a wired network.Setup (including WEP) was a snap from any of the computers on the network using the html based setup utility, and the network has stayed up for weeks at a time without a reset.The only reason I gave this a 4 instead of a 5 is the somewhat chunky design....UPDATED on 1/30 - I just brought home an iBook w/ an Airport card. Once I figured out what Apple needed to ID the network, the router has been working flawlessly."
2,This Series was Wonderful,"Happened upon this movie on the Hallmark Channel on weekend. After watching this movie, I just had to see the rest of the series. It was just great! If you are a fan of westerns, this is a wonderful series to watch and to own."
2,Reader from Tokyo bang on the money,"I wish to echo the sentiments expressed by ""A Reader from Tokyo"". This is a near perfect book that not only works as a piece of literature but as something of an education. I personally am trying to track down a copy of Bach's ""Art of the Fugue"" as well as some of the other pieces referenced throughout the novel. In fact, my only quibble with the book is that I wish it had provided a music bibliography with more precise details than the characters sometimes provided. Anyway, a very worthwhile read and one that makes you appreciate classical music more than you might already. And the ending leaves room for a sequel: my suggestion is that Michael wakes up from a coma and it turns out he and Julia nbever went to Italy: I call it The Phantom Venice."
2,The Consultant's Quick Start Guide by Elaine Biech,"Elaine Biech has written a fantastic workbook for anyone considering a consulting career. The book is full of practical advice for both those just starting and those who've been at it a while. I would have loved to have had this guidance when I started my consulting career.The workbook approach, with ample space to record your thoughts and plans, works very well. There are places to record your anticipated expenses, likely clients, marketing plan, and your family's thoughts and concerns about your plans, to name just a few."
2,Nice,This is a nice mat to workout on. Received it on time and overall happy with the purchase. Will buy again if needed.
2,Paula Cole Rocks!,"Okay, so she doesn't shave her pits (good attention grabber, huh Mr. Sullivan?), but this CD rocks so much. I met her and she is the nicest person in the world!She is so sweet and beautiful, but back to her CD. She has a definate attitude and I am glad for it because she has created one of the awesomest CD's I have ever heard. I can so relate to *Tiger* and some of the lyrics are so shocking that they are haunting and unforgetable. Paula Cole rocks so hard. If you ever get a chance to see her in concert, go for it!"
2,Excellent Resource,This Bible is teeming with information! It is a combination of history and practical application of God's principle's.
2,limitless,"It'd be cool to have a pill like that, which makes you super smart in every way there is and have such a clear view of the world.. but it does have it's side-effect like every drug out there. Brad Cooper plays a down-on-his-luck book writer who through chance meets his ex-wife's brother who gives him a pill that makes him more so.. and poof, all this great stuff happens... and then the bad stuff happens and he has to find a way to stay on the pills and not die and fix everything and everybody around him. It was a fun film with good visuals.. like the sex scene and everything that he sees.. pure limitless enjoyment.."
2,It is pure Fun!,This book is just a joy to read. What I enjoyed is that I could read this and know that all it was doing was alowing me to escape for a little while. You will not find this as the best book you will ever read. But I love it because it is fun.
2,That's 70's Show,"That '70s Show: Complete GiftsetNo commericals, I can watch them any time, makes me feel like a kid again. The worse part I still see the guy's in real life. Glory Days! Oh Boy! The set is better than buying one season at a time."
2,Ballard's quest to find the RMS Titanic,"Being an absolute fan of the Titanic, this novel by Robert Ballard was very interesting. He takes you from Woodshole to the North Atlantic Ocean to search for the Titanic. Then he narrates the discovery of the great ship while he takes you 2 miles below the surface to explore the famous ill-fated liner."
2,Interesting Book,"As the owner of a small business, I'd have to say that the insight in Portraits of Success by James Olan Hutcheson has really shed new light on the way that my business should be managed. It has helped me to loosen my grip and allow leaders to emerge that I didn't even know we had. Before reading this book, I thought that my business ran somewhat smoothly, but now I feel enlightened as to what needs to be changed and what just needs to be strengthened to make my business run like the well oiled machine that it should be."
2,great,"This is the perfect storage unit for the shower. I share a bathroom with a roomate and it works perfectly, creating space in the shower."
2,Loved it!!!,This was my first Fannie Flagg book and I really enjoyed it. The story continually switches from the past to the present and I initially found it confusing but came to appreciate the way it was written. I really felt for the main character of Dena. In the beginning I thought she was a bit shallow and selfish with her life spiraling out of control but by the end I found myself cheering her on and appreciating her for what she went through. The book slowly weaves characters in and out of the story and you wonder how the pieces fit together but by the end of the book everything comes together like a tightly wrapped package.
2,Does what it should,"Not much to say here. It works just like it should. Doesn't do anything surprisingly better than I was expecting either. Decent price.I would have given 4 stars, but the website isn't letting me do it."
2,good book,one of our favorite authors and a good read but of course it is in conunction with greatest movie ever made.
2,The Royal Pain,I actually enjoyed all three of these books (The Royal Pain is the 2nd). This was my second favorite out of the series and really did enjoy reading about the Alaskan Royal family. These are light hearted silly books with no nail biting drama. They are an easy read but seriously laugh out loud funny.
2,iit's OK,"it proved to be what it said it would be. Good for a new player, good short cut. Nice book."
2,A fantastic performance,"Watch the moving film about the life and living of Sir Charles Chaplin. Stunning performance by Robert Downey Jr, Kevin Kline, Anthony Hopkins among others.A film that will move you to tears."
2,great item,"Easy to attach to the wall and holds a LOT of stuffed animals. My daughter's room is much more organized w/out 50 or so stuffed animals covering the floor. She was a tad upset when we put them out of reach, but quickly got over it. We left out her favorites and put the others in the hammock where she can still enjoy looking at them."
2,not the most perfect magazine out there...........,I have been subcribing to j-14 since i was 6 years old.I thought it was the coolest things out there.From the Jan. 2001issue on it was bad. I still read it expect they have crappy stuff in thier mag since it's 2004 and it's different from 2000rigghhtt??? IT's o.k. if u like hilary duff or lindsay lohanwitch i do.. But if u want cool mags i reccomend:M MAG!GOOD STUFF!!!!!!!!!
2,"Very bright, very small!","Not much else to add besides what the the title says. Oh, the clasp appears to be very secure and not flimsy."
2,Delightful fictionalization of the Christmas Truce.,"I watched this film because I am considering a celebration of the event's 100th anniversary. As a fictional account, it has only a little actual content for that purpose, but I enjoyed the film. Even though it is not exactly accurate in its portrayal of the events, the characters' feelings and actions are portrayed in a way that provokes larger questions about people's motivations in war situations."
2,Aliens & The military,How can you go wrong with aliens & the military. Love the sci-fi genre and love the military. What better way to the the 2 in action.
2,Happy Curly Hair!,"The ISO ""Bouncy"" hair care products are GREAT - my curls have never been happier! Highly recommended for natural curls."
2,dark and haunting,"This book is probably the darkest book of all the VC books, even more so than the Dollanganger series. Audrina's character is developed in a very confusing way, so it's a little frustrating when you try to make sense of the book, yet it kept me hooked until the very end. I like how the book takes place in a gothic setting where time seemingly has stopped. It has a great plot and keeps you wondering up until the end of the book. I took off one star because I didn't really like Arden towards the end of the book. He developed into a weak, incompetent guy who was nowhere near good enough for Audrina. And I absolutely HATED the ending of this book!! It was a major disappointment for me. It left me feeling INCREDIBLY sorry for Audrina. Poor girl...after suffering so much...and this is all she ends up with..."
2,A more atmospheric Chapin album,"Although I don't agree that this is Harry's best album, it is certainly an incredible work. Perhaps because it came before my time. 'Taxi' and 'Dogtown' are really the only story songs of the bunch, a genre with which Chapin has really become identified and where he really shines. I've found that this album is definitely more atmospheric and somber than his other albums. It's a like a small voice that creeps into your mind rather than shouting at you. 'Empty' is a particularily somber and overlooked piece that I really grew attached to without really being able to explain why. Great album, but I would rate 'Dance Band on the Titanic', 'Legends of the Lost and Found' and 'Portrait Gallery' and possibly 'Verities & Balderdash' as slightly superior albums."
2,Great Buy,"I think this atlas is wonderful. First, the atlas is 8 by 11.5 inches. This means that the atlas easily fits into binder pockets, folders, brief cases, and back packs. When I went to the bookstore, it seemed like most of the other atlases were larger than this one and therefore inconvenient to carry around.Another great thing about this atlas is its index. The index is easy to use and therefore makes finding landmarks a simple task.The maps found within the book are clear. However it does take a little time to get adjusted to the presentation of the maps.The best thing about this atlas is that it is cheap! If you are using an atlas for a course in school, you don't want to break your bank acount.The atlas also has useful facts listed in its inside covers. For example, the Earth's dimensions and longest rivers are given.I highly recommend this atlas."
2,A must read for parents and teachers!,"I love this book!! It is an easy read and provides problem-solving approaches and communication techniques that improve the behavior of children, teens, and adults. It further identifies social issues resulting in the breakdowns of our moral intelligence with reminders on how to improve."
2,4 original songs exclusive to this Mini-Album,"You only get these TMBG songs on this stand-alone single, and it's worth it. ""The Sun Is A Mass Of Incandescant Gas"" is a great semi-childish song that features that educational ego that they have only done previously with ""Mammal"". The remake of the Almond Brother's ""Jessica"" is decent, but the backdrop remake of the Meat Puppets' ""Whirlpool"" is great, done with echoing horns. The alternate version of ""Spy"" is, in my opinion, better than the version on ""John Henry"". Get a great single and learn about how the Sun is a mass of incandescent gas...at the same time."
2,good supplement,"good supplement of introductory quantum field theory. particle physics books often have aggressiveness but this is in a relaxed mood, apt for reading in fine sunday mornings. 27 chapters in 300 pages, short chapters, without one for manifold and topology. from this book you can't get a mathematically deep understanding of Lie algebra nor exotic viewpoint for particle/string, but that's not this is for. i hope someday this will be included in Dover classics.1.finite groups 2.Lie groups 3.SU(2) 4.tensor operators 5.isospin 6.roots and weights 7.SU(3) 8.simple roots 9.more SU(3) 10.tensor methods 11.hypercharge and strangeness 12.Young tableaux 13.SU(n) 14.3-d harmonic oscillator 15.SU(6) and the quark model 16.color 17.constituent quarks 18.unified theories and SU(5) 19.classical groups 20.classification theorem 21.SO(2n+1)and spinors 22.SO(2n+2)spinors 23.SU(n)<SO(2n) 24.SO(10) 25.automorphisms 26.Sp(2n) 27.odds and ends - E6"
2,Another yummy snack fish love!!,My Betta Sammy and his community tankmates of small Tetras and Zebra danios love these too. Yummy for their tummies. I like to vary my fishs diet and this is part of it. They love these. They're great for small fish. I see o reason why larger ones won't like it either.
2,Helpful I suppose,"Basically, they show tricks being done slowly and give advice on how to do them correctly. This can be very helpful or totally useless depending on how you use it. It is something that you only watch a couple times and then never watch again."
2,Fantastic!,"I purchased these earplugs for my new iPod that I got for Christmas because I hated the white earphones that come with the iPod. I previously owned red Marshmallow earplugs and I thought these were the same ones with just different colors, but, they're aren't but it's okay, they're still comfortable and very easy to carry around. Unfortunately, these aren't good for working out. They don't stick in your ears while your running/etc. But other then that, they're fantastic. If you work around a warehouse or something with loud noice, use these. They can block out the sound very well."
2,A new mix for Ladies fans,"BNL comes out with a long awaited follow up to the smash hit Stunt. All true BNL fans know that Stunt was a little different than some of there older stuff. However it was still catchy and still had a a good sound, though not as great as say Gordon. Maroon is a delightful mix of old school BNL, a bit of Stunt, and a new Maroon style. Catchy songs like ""Too little too late"" and ""pinch me"" capture the feel good BNL side, while ""the humor of the situation"" and ""sell sell sell"" reflect the cleverness of the band. A great pick for a BNL fan ,and good for others as well, though it wont be as popular as Stunt."
2,"Good press, but no dimple","This press makes dents across the surface of the hamburger rather than a golf-ball diameter indent that helps get a flat patty when you grille it.Otherwise, it's a good press...use waxed paper sheets to get the patties out easily. Non-stick isn't."
2,Best Picture ever Filmed!,"I first saw this movie on tv when I was about 7 or 8 years old. I've seen it dozens of times since then (the tv cut and the uncut)...it has to be my favorite movie of ALL time. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that it was produced in 1984, the year I was born. Every time I watch it, I find something new about it I didn't see the time before. In fact, I JUST finished watching it on cable a few minutes ago! I will most definately buy this movie a.s.a.p! It's a classic!"
2,Good!,This book serves the purpose (to attain DB2 fundamentals certification) very well. Some experience with DB2 and reading this book is all that is required to pass the 512 exam.
2,Flowtron 80-watt Insect Killer,"I have owned one of these units before and its still working after many years and a few bulb replacements. The bulbs should be replaced yearly for optimum performance. This unit does the job! The 40-watt size doesn't work as well. I started out ordering 2- replacement bulbs for my current unit from Amazon at a total cost of around $36. I ordered the bulbs and then realized that the cost of a new unit INCLUDING BULBS was $55. What a deal. I ordered the new unit and donated the still working old unit. I highly recommend this product. I live in California and the bug problem is not as bad as on the East coast. However, I spend time in my backyard relatively flying insect free."
2,"An Engrossing, Well-Written Romance","If you read Rules of the Wild as a literary work with deep philosophical meaning, you will be disappointed. The only conclusion reached at the end of the novel is some vague highly romanticized circle of life stuff. But if you read Rules of the Wild as the romance novel it is, you will love it and will not be able to put it down. Esme is a totally convincing character and so are some of the other characters in the book."
2,Great mattress topper,"I really enjoyed this mattress topper. I purchased a king size topper for a queen size bed, and cut the topper to fit my bed, based on other reviews. I was not able to sleep in the bed without my back hurting before I got the topper. The topper eliminated this problem and I was able to sleep through the night without a problem. I would recommend this product to anyone who is uncomfortable in their bed, but does not want to buy a new one."
2,John F. Mullins - Days of fire,"John Mullins has become very famous worldwide because the computer game Soldier Of Fortune. The game is based in this book. If you have played the game you know it`s a lot of acton in it, have you finished the game why don`t read the book, cause the book is very exiting. If you have played the game and want to know John Mullins better, this book is for you."
2,I finally understand Ben,This is the most insightful book on this significant icon of American history. I couldn't put this book down. Definitely worth the investment.
2,Romeo and Juliet soundtrack,I soooooooo love this CD cos it contains the Romeo and Juliet soundtrack: Lovefool. Leonardo di caprio is my crush.
2,great pop-ups!,"I bought this book to help explain Santa Claus and Christmas to my two year old son. (He was afraid of Santa last year.) As I turned the pages, my son kept saying ""WOOOWW"" at all the pop-ups. It is a very colorful book and fun to read. It is definitely on a two year old level (just enough wording). And now he's asking to go see Santa!!"
2,GRIM'S A HIT,"I loved this cartoon from the very first time I watched it, getting this First Season DVD set is great to have and to watch when you want. You can see how this cartoon grew from the early stages with this set, this is a MUST HAVE DVD for any Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy! The Evil Con Carne show is solid stuff and they should add more to the next season release and the Grim & Evil episodes too..."
2,Stay in place,Product works as advertised and seller shipped item promptly. Would buy from this seller again.
2,Fresh stuff,"Super great catnip. The quality is great, and amazingly fresh. The ten keeps it that way.Every time I open it, my cat goes crazy.(FWI: Remember, never give a kitten catnip. When they become adults it has less of an effect on them, or no effect at all depending on the cat.)"
2,Dinosaur,I love this movie~I have the VHS format but I haven't been able to watch it since my VHS player brokeI was so happy to get the Blu-ray/DVD combo
2,"Brilliant, Beautiful, Enlightening!!","This is one of the best documentary films i have ever seen. PLEASE WATCH THIS, no matter who you are!! The amazing strength of this film is that the transgendered individuals whose lives are chronicled are not portrayed as in any way strange, bizarre, or freakish...they are portrayed as what they really ARE...fully **human**....compassionate heart-and-soul human beings...and not even the most homophobic viewer could miss that message. This is real, it's powerful, and trust me, have some tissues on hand."
2,Perfect Pick,I'm sooooo glad we found this book!! My daughter has story book character day at school and had to pick a book and a costume. We were so happy when we saw this book because the picture on the front cover looks a lot like my daughter. We were also thrilled with the pop ups. My daughter can't wait to carry this book to school to share with her class. She's only 6 and the pop ups will help her with reading the story to the class. I'm sure they will love this book too!!

2,Get this set. Now.,"Simply outstanding. These are powerful, elegantly performed, with crystalline sonics and well-balanced visuals. Others have observed the relative youth of the orchestra. No longer the almost all-male group of past years. It is the set I go to in order to enjoy Beethoven. Abbado conducts with parsimonious energy. The tempos are indeed faster than usual, but the harmonies are still clearly articulated.Do note that the version of the Ninth Symphony is in a different venue--I assume the Berliner's home hall. It is not quite up to the quality of the rest of the set, but still very good.At this price, the set is a steal. Get it before it goes out of print again. Even if you have another set, get it."
2,An Incredible Book,"I would just like to say, that most of the people who wrote the reviews above didn't even understand the book. True, the book is about a couple of days in a sixteen-year-old's life, but there is a point, a reason in which Holden Caulfield explains about those particular days of his life. There is a process of alienation which occurs throughout the book and finally comes to a hidden conclusion at the end of the book, which results in having to read the last chapter very carefully to find out about Holden's whereabouts at that point. I had to read the last chapter three times before I finally understood where he really was and why he didn't give details in that chapter. All in all, this is a fantastic book about alienation and adaptation only for those who truly understand it, and for those who don't understand the meaning, it is a funny story about a cynical teenager's life."
2,Buick book A Complete History,My husband loves Buicks. I drive a 2011 Lacrosse and he has two antique Buicks. I got this book for him as a Christmas gift and he absolutely loves it. I would highly recommend this book for any Buick lover.
2,Diamond in the rough,"This is one groovy, eclectic, folkie album, that will surprise. Call it alternative country or whatever you like. Second of two laid back country cds that represent what you might imagine true country to be, from an artist who also runs base for an excellent rocky/puckish/heady band called The Smalls. Mixes well with red wine, green ciqarettes and an album by the Super Suckers called ""Must've been high""... Don't let that last reference discourage, these are perfect tunes for everyone...Cheers from Victoria, B.C."
2,Excellent film. Very cool.,"Excellent theme, plot, and acting. Effects were great and the gadgets were cool. The language was pretty bad but the movie keeps you on the edge of your seats asking questions like, what will happen next? or, is he gonna die? I recommend this movie as a great action movie!"
2,5 stars is not enough!!,"There are women who sing ""anthems"". This is beyond ""anthems"" and goes into another realm! If you don't get lost in the space between Kristine's perfect vocals and the killer arrangements then i am afraid you are not fully alive. This cd stands out in a world of boring pop albums!! GET IT!!"
2,Quick Service,I received my book in within a few days and for a great price!! I bought this book for a conservation biology course.
2,Shazaam,"This is an awesome backpack, it is going to last me a long time. I don't use it for my laptop but I could see how it would work for that. It has great pockets in the right places, feels great on with and without weight and is not obnoxious at all. People will see the red, but there is enough gray and black to really balance it out. Whenever this one wears out I will definetely buy another High Sierra backpack. It comes with a lifetime warranty and you can't beat that!"
2,SECOND BEST REFERENCE BOOK ON REGISTRY,"This book has the same strengths and weaknesses of all reference books on Windows 98. Each provides useful knowledge but none are able to cover every major procedure, issue, or problem in Windows 98. Perhaps, that is the underlining problem with Windows; too many topics to cover in one book.I am not fond of Windows95/98/ME but there is nothing on the market that is close to it, unless you decide to join the other eight users of Apple computers.This book provides good useful information but it does not give enough specific instructions about tweaking the registry. This book finishes a close second to ""Win 98 Registry; Little Black Book"" which is loaded with that type of information. I use both books and consider both very valuable reference materials.If you plan to work in the registry, you will need this book."
2,The wire,This was purchased for a friend who is in love with show. Thought I would surprise them with starting a collection for them.
2,"Brilliant, yet funny","Stanley Kubrick, the director of such masterpieces as A CLOCKWORK ORANGE or 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, brings a brilliantly funny black comedy about the cold war. About a crazed military officer who orders planes to wrongly bomb Russia, this film will be forever remember. MUST be seen for all classic film buffs"
2,Wedge Pillow,"I purchased the wedge pillow as it was recommended to me by my doctor to help with recovery from eyelid surgery. I am not used to sleeping on my back and initially I really liked the comfort. However, after a few days, I started to slide down the pillow and found myself on my side. I no longer need the pillow for elevation of my head, so my husband now uses it to watch TV in bed. He loves it!"
2,The Becoming,This is such an awesome book. I can't see how Lynne Ewing thought of the idea. I think that this is the best book of the series. In this book Tianna finds that she has been acting weird lately and cannot control her power. Now she discovers that she is the becoming but has no clue what is means. Read the book. You will love it!
2,tdkrn,ExcellentMidland WR-300 AM/FM Weather/All Hazards/Civil Emergency Alert Monitor with S.A.M.E.weather radio and alerts come on before the TV reports the weather. Only problem is the instructions are hard to read and you can hardly see the AM and PM on the screen to set the clock.
2,Profile in Brutality,"Moynihan's book serves as a solid overview of what is painted as a fairly blighted century. From collectivization, to Stalin's brutal purges, to invasion by Nazis, to the dark restless sleep of the soul inspired by Brezhnev, the Communist years were not kind to the Russians. From the tsar to Yeltsin, Moynihan offers a clear mix of history and analysis that makes this a quick read. Still, the chapter on Russia's war with Germany unfolds like the blitzkrieg, and if you're looking for details, this is not your book. Moynihan paints with very broad strokes and does not attempt to get into the minds of the Russian people. Given that they were treated as nothing more than neccessary cogs in Stalin's megalomaniacal drive to modernize a peasant state, it would be nice to know more about their perspective. Nonetheless, this is a lucid narrative of a century's worth of troubles."
2,Black Comedy!!!!,"What a good movie this is. I love this movie and I couldn't find it in the store so, I bought it on amazon. True black comedy that the family can enjoy....sit back, relax & enjoy!!!!"
2,Perfect..inexpensive,"inexpensive, quick delivery...this worked perfect for me - I would recommend this for anyone that needs a power cord for computer, etc."
2,Ultra Large - Absorbent Underpads --,I bought these underpads for my mother (recovering from a stroke) to use at night time. They have been a God send. They're very absorbent and protect her bedsheets. I would definitely buy them again.
2,Wow!,"WOw! this is one of the best CDs I own! When I first listened to it I was amazed with the talent of this band, there are some incredible solos! Being a trombone player myself I love the instrumentals that can be found in every song. Each song is totally upbeat and spectacular, this CD remains great all the way through. It's a great one to add to all you ska fan's collections, it's one of my favorites!"
2,Simply amazing,A magical story.. full of mystery and adventure.. I highly recommend to watch this movie.. it's the best animated movie i have ever seen.. i would give 10 stars not just 5
2,A great book for beginners like me!,"I bought the Premiere Elements software because I already had Photoshop Elements (they are both by Adobe) and I really liked it. I think Photoshop Elements is the best program to work with when it comes to digital pictures. I just started creating videos (in October), so I thought Premiere Elements would be the perfect complement. Was I ever wrong! Premiere Elements is pretty hard to use and totally confusing (at least to me). This book really does make it seem ""easy"" and the pictures are really cute. It helped me to get started really quickly. I still have a lot to learn, but I would recommend this book to anyone who has tried to use Premiere Elements and then totally freaked out when they saw the software for the first time. I was so frustrated! Now I can edit my videos easily after the holidays (I'm sure everyone in them will be happy)! Adobe should give this book away with their software!"
2,Finally in English,I love this book it has all the gothic goodness that I have been looking for. I was into Vampire hunter D ever since The Anime movie.
2,Great sound on DVD,"Just listened to the DVD on my Dolby Digital (5.1) system, and the remastering is sensational. I have most of the soundtrack cuts on CD, but the versions here are much better. Excellent cinematography is more apparent on DVD than on video, as well. Documentary on the making of the film is very interesting... don't miss it. Didn't have time to listen to Hopper's commentary (other than a few minutes), but am taping it now and will check it out later. Great package!"
2,"""A Title For My Review""","With the exception of Everybody Move It, I love every song on this album. Also I'd like to mention that his voice is as beautiful live as it is on cd. I personally think he is a better singer than either one of his parents."
2,"So good, I had to replace it!","This is one of, if not the best freestyle mix around. I owned it before, but lost it, and just had to replace it. If you like freestyle, this is a must CD."
2,Better than I thought it would be,"I bought this backpack for my boyfriend who went back to school after losing his job of 10 years. It is not a large backpack, but it is not small either. The leather is of good quality, and the stitching is pretty good too. It was only after a year and a half of very hard use that the stitching gave way on the straps. Since my regular sewing machine isn't strong enough to go through that thick of leather, we took it in to a professional. She fixed it, as well as doing some extra reinforcement for $10, and the backpack is as good as ever. This was a really great buy!"
2,I laughed at first,"My non-horsey boyfriend bought this book for me for my birthday. The book name is kind of generic, but I figured he at least got an E for effort. However, once I got started I have been savoring each story. This is definitely a book for horse lovers....real horse lovers. A story taken from ""My Horses My Teachers"" by Podiesky (sp?) is outstanding. The story about Buck Brannamen - ""The Horse Whisperer"" was another I'll never forget. Ignore the stupid name and buy this book. Make a cup of hot cocoa on a cold winter night and just get lost in the stories."
2,Great Book about War for People that Hate War Books,"This is one of the best books I have ever read. It was assigned for one of my college courses, and I dreaded reading it. I have never liked war books or war movies. I was taken by suprise when I could not put the book down. It goes into the very heart of the characters- it is very raw, deep, and thought-provoking. It is written in a very post-modern way--- so it reads different than most novels. Take the time to read this book and really meditate on the themes presented in the book."
2,Good booster seat,This is my second grow with me portable booster seat that I have purchased. We really liked the one we bought for our son a year ago and bought another one for our daughter. I like the color selection. The only complaint is that food gets caught in the seat and it can be diffucult to clean after everymeal. I would recommend this seat to any others out there. This was my 4th booster seat I purchased for my son. The only one that I was happy with. My children's sitter also has these booster seats and she loves them.
2,Donna Richardson-4 Day Rotation Workout,"Love it! I am a busy wife and mother of 2. I can fit the 15 minute routine into my schedule. If time allows, I can do more than one segment. I have given several copies as gifts."
2,Sorry you guys are all wrong....yep...,"I have no problems with saying that I am a geek, but yes, this is not mace windu's hilt, it is actually his from episode 1 when he never drew his lightsaber...it also had a blue blade. Mace actually makes the new electron (gold) hilt after becoming a senior council member. And this is not half of darth maul's lightsaber (the hilt that is), but now Plo Koon's lightsaber (dies in jedi starfighter, weird mask lookin dude). You can look up all this information in the DK Star Wars Visual Dictionaries. They are a great read! Pick them up also! I'm down with the purple also."
2,We put it to a real test,"We have owned this radio for 4 years now. It has been dropped, beat, thrown, and now we tried to drown it (not on purpose).We were on vacation, and left it in the boat when it rained. It was found bobbing up and down and it still works perfect!"
2,Great driver!,I also have the smaill dewalt driver and the bosch is much easier to handle and the battery lasts much longer. The soft case is also so much smaller and easier to store than the huge plastic case you get with the dewalt.
2,Great Stories of the Ottoman Imperial Court,"This fascinating book summarizes the court life of the Ottoman sultans in Istanbul. It begins with a few short passages on the founding of the dynasty in the 13th Century, but the most intriguing stories begin after the fall of Constantinople in 1453 and the Ottoman takeover of the city.John Freely writes in a clear and concise manner that makes what could be complex material simpler to read. And the characters, from the royal courtiers to the concubines to the sultans themselves are all portrayed with fascinating insight. The text is illustrated throughout by some beautiful prints and sketches as well.This is a great book about the inner workings of the court life of the Ottoman dynasty, and will likely whet the reader's appetite to do delve more deeply into the subject."
2,Great for cats. Mediocre for hands.,"I bought this to replace the harsh, metal brush I was using that snagged my cat's fur and made yer yelp and bite. Not only is this product gentler never irritates her, but to my surprise, it picks up much more hair as well. The rubber prongs seem to attract the hair like a magnet. No complaints in that dept.My only problem is with the design.It doesn't fit my hand very well and tends to shift around. The thumb pad is totally extraneous, and its hot, and tends to make my hand sweat. I would definitely buy a product that had the same brushing surface but on a stick instead. In fact, I may take this one apart and make on myself."
2,Wonderful!,"I used this book for a class but fell in love with so many beautiful, powerful poems inside. Needless to say, I did not sell this book after taking this course."
2,I liked the movie...,...and I liked the music. I collected the music from both films - Donnie Darko and S. Darko. Michael Andrews version of Tear For Fears' Mad World is fantastic and really catches the essence of the film...
2,A Minute of Margin,"Outstanding book. Short but profound daily thoughts that help keep life and priorities on track. Outstanding gift to business colleagues, family and friends."
2,Kicks butt,"Sounds like it was just recorded in 2010-progressive musicianship- and of course, when Eric Burden lets go it's a free for all. A total pick me up and flash me back to the era of music that I love so much!"
2,"I thought it was too fast at first, but...","That's what Power Yoga is: a fairly continuous switch from posture to posture.The first time I did this I thought: ""My God, this is too advanced for me--it's going pretty fast.""After the second time I was fine: you end up listening rather than watching, and once you've figured out the routine, you know what's coming (most of the first half of the flexibility segment is repetitive).If you're an absolute beginner, don't start with power yoga. If you've done it a while or intermittently and want a step up, I like this DVD. The music's fine and Rodney's voice is pretty soothing.Recommended."
2,Green Mountain French Vanilla coffee,The coffee which is delicious came quickly. The price was good and I didn't have to use gas to buy it.
2,dislike this,the keychain slot thingie didn't work out. and I had to like tie it with some sort of string. and the cap keeps getting lost. i actually lost the cap.
2,GREAT MOVIE,LOVED IT! WATCHED IT 20 BILLION TIMES AND WANT TO BUY IT FOR MY OWN PERSONAL COLLECTION:)
2,So much depth and sounds fantastic miked!,This head sounds fantastic on my Steve Jordan snare! You might want a moon gel for it tho! So much depth with a good amount of crack!
2,An excellent translation with commentary and analysis,"In searching for a good translation of the Tao-Te/Te-Tao Ching, I was delighted to find this book. A translation of the remnants of two early copies of the book, it provides new insight into the classic, as well as a good translation. The text of the original documents are reprinted, and commentary is made on the translation, particles, likely meanings, etc. Commentary is made on popular interpretations and ways of organizing the chapters. For the casual reader, a ""comment-free"" copy is included in this book.An excellent resource for scholars, philosophers, and those interested in Chinese history and language."
2,Get The Book Before It Is Too Late,"Unfortunately I was not made aware of this book until after my wife had committed suicide. This book should be read by everyone who has a loved one suffering from depression or manic-depressive illness. Ignore the statistics and concentrate on how you can help your loved one. If the statistics tell you anything, it is that not 100% of ill people commit suicide. I believe there can be positive results if you are aware of the danger signs and understand the deep, dark shadow that engulfs someone suffering from the mental illnesses. I only gave the book four stars because I think the message could do without the statistics (maybe in an appendix)"
2,A keeper,"This book was written very well. It does feel like a Friends show, with the occasional cafe scene and mentions of New York, but it feels like it could happen to anyone. I loved the relationship between Trevor and Lee. They love and know and trust each other well. Even when they are hurting, they will do anything to keep from hurting the other person. I really believe that they will make it. I want more stories like this!"
2,Great toy,"This is a great toy.We got this toy as a gift when our daughter was born 8 months ago. I would say this is the most entertaining toy in her collection of toys right now. Our daughter is very hyperactive, and we used this toy to pacify her during her feeding times. Unlike other toys I have seen, this toy has several songs and nursery rhymes, and it is an excellent educational toy for babies. Since this is a soft toy, it would not hurt the baby if he/she falls on it. Only bad thing is that after several months of our daughter chewing on the ear, the connectors broke and the doll does not make any sound when you press the ear.Now I am going to get this for my cousin's twins. I am sure they would love it."
2,Holes B/S,"I thought that Holes was a very good book because it shows how Stanley gets through some hardships with his family and his tentmates. This book showed me that the characters in this book had a lot of courage and some were a little bit crazy which is a good thing to have in a book, mixed feelings. After reading this book I as well had some mixed feelings, I either enjoyed some parts or I disliked parts but most of all I liked ther parts. This book overall was an inside look of what a discipline camp would be like and what these kids had to face on a day to day basis. This book was an excellent book that everybody should read in their free time or for a book report."
2,Superb rendition of neglected French Songs,"This disk contains some exquisite art songs by Massenet and Gounod, many of which I have never seen in other French art song collections. They are interspersed with the songs of two 20th century composers, Louis Beydts and Maurice Delage. Beydts's music is quite lyrical and tonal, reminiscent of the later songs of Reynaldo Hahn - the real jewel is his ""L'Oiseau Bleu"" (also the title of the CD). Delage's is slightly more modernistic - I think his subtle French wit is lost a bit on me. The high point of this disk is Zimmer's performance of the Massenet songs. It is no wonder the most singers have ignored these songs, the lyrical melodic lines that soar thru the upper register must be quite a feat, and Zimmer makes them sound effortless. She sings Massenet with the same technical brilliance as Beverly Sills and with incredible clarity of tone and warmth."
2,Great CD,"This is one of those Cd's that you can listen to from beginning to end. The whole CD is awesome. My favorite songs are WHAT IF, WITH ARMS OPEN WIDE, and the HUGE hit, HIGHER. They have a unique rock sound, that is not to heavy, yet certainly not soft. They have been compared to Pearl Jam, whichis a fair comparison. You will be happy with your purchase."
2,Microsoft Office Home and Student,"I've had other word processing programs, but word is the best! Haven't gotten to Excel yet, but Word is working out well. Great price!"
2,There are TWENTY (20) Sheet Lifters,"I could never find these sheet lifters (or guards) when buying three-ring binders at the local office-supply store. I tended to reuse the same lifters/guards for years. However, the Wilson Jones products solves my shortage for the foreseeable future. Each package includes TWENTY (20) sheet lifters. The black, matte plastic lifters look like boomerangs. Solid purchase and low-low price."
2,Love them,If you never have owned a pair of smartwools your missing out on the better things in life. I love them and I wear them year around.
2,Great toy!,We were walking through a store and my husband found a demo model of this toy and turned it on for my three month old daughter. For the first time in her life she oohed and aahed over a toy. Of course my husband bought it immediately. She is completely captivated by this toy. It has great music thats not plunky like most mobiles and the toys are capivating visually. We took down our mobile that matches her room and this one is here to stay. What a great toy!
2,Incredibly Tasteful and Creative Ideas,"This book is excellent for both engaged couples planning their weddings, and those who want to plan weddings as a career. The colors and shapes of each spread give them a strong impact without becoming tacky and flamboyant. I highly recommend it!"
2,Great Performance but the sound could sure be better,This is a Great Band this was a Great live performance alsoUnfortantly the sound quality is not to great highs are booseted a bit to much and very little bassSounds like they compressed the whole mix to make it louderDon't get me wrong it was well recorded just a bad mix for this CDLove this band I have all there stuff on Vinyl Records and they sounds great.If you like stone ground then you should have this CD
2,Monkey in the Rainforest,Our grandchild loves the Rainforest. It keeps him happy for a long time. I really love the little Monkey with the curly tail that will hang anywhere you want it to.
2,"Bring me your tired, your poor...","I wasn't sure what to expect from this collection, which gathers together Eisner's three graphic novels about the mythic Dropsie Avenue, a street in New York patterned after Eisner's own childhood neighborhood. I'd never read any of Eisner's work, famous as he is, and I mostly thought of him as the creator of The Spirit, a comic book hero.This trilogy, though, is both an autobiography of sorts for Eisner and a biography of a street in New York City. The three books share an attention to detail combined with an epic sweep of history. Eisner explores religion, the meaning of life, aging, poverty, immigration, racial and ethnic relations, and the development of urban centers with a keenly observant -- if not objective -- eye.The black-and-white illustrations are perfect for the stories. The drawing has a raggedly realistic style that catches every piece of cracked plaster, every shadowed face, every trick of the light.Recommended."
2,Muller and McCone Back on Track,"Despite a somewhat convoluted ending, I thought this was one of the more successful McCone mysteries in recent memory. I, for one, have not embraced the increasingly high-tech nature of McCone's practice over the years, so it was good to see her relying more this time around on good old-fashioned leg-work. And although Muller's dialogue is not always believable, her writing is better than most of those who are currently putting out this kind of disposable whodunit. All in all a great beach read, no thinking required."
2,Excellent collection of books,The books are wonderful. The box set made my daughter feel like she had gotten something very special. The illustrations are well done. We will have lots of good mommy/daughter snuggle time reading through these books.
2,early morning,"For the early morning rush, I grab one of these and a cup of coffee and I am all set, good too"
2,A True Insider's view of the early yearsof the Dallas Cowboy,"Any one who is a true football fan should read this book. It is realistic, surprising and sometimes shocking in its revelations of the inner feelings of the players during the early years of the Dallas Cowboys. It is written without taking sides; relating the men, their emotions and their relationships with fellow players in factual, graphic terms. You cannot read this and feel the same way you did before about America's Team. The only parts missing are the Cowboys who didn't want to tell their side such as ""Dandy Don"". These missing voices create a silence in the telling of the whole story. Still, one can relate to the events and emotions that shaped the Cowboys and that generation of Americans. 4.5 STARS"
2,Great purchase,"I order this one for my husband who works outside most of the time, I had to exchange it the first time because it didn't fit him, he is a 34 and it was very tigh, so I got him a 36, which still a little tigh, my suggestion as other reviewers said is to order 2 size bigger, believe me it won't be too big at all, the quality is great, delivery was on time and for the exchange even faster..."
2,Great kit for camping,"i bought this kit almost ten years ago...(the cups back then were blue). it has come on every camping trip ive been on since and has been a great mess kit. over the years ive lost the plasic cups, but they werent too helpful anyways. it has held up very well, seeing what i put it through each trip. eventually the plasic on the handles will become a bit brittle, but i usually bring along a pot holder anyways, which makes that a non-issue. the set fits together very well and the copper bottoms help with heat distribution. i gave it 4 stars because its great but not perfect. the handles fold out of the way well, but eventually the plastic wears out. the plasic cups are CHEAP-but who cares. the sack mine came in was plasic (useless)...and im not sure if thats changed- if not, id suggest getting a mesh stuff sack. overall, this is a great set for camping-its too heavy for backpacking. the stainless steel is a welcome change to anyone used to using aluminum. [...]"
2,"A very good, and deep book","I think that at first, this book might just seem like any other book, but for school I had to make an analysis of the book. I soon discovered that their are tons of hidden meaning, and hidden messages that might not be found if you read the book once through. Holden is a lost boy who only really likes children because of their innocense."
2,Super easy hot off the griddle pizzelles!,"I love this little machine! The recipes are easy and pizzelles are delicious. This pizzelle maker heats up in a hurry and lets me make a dozen of these sweet, addictive treats in no time at all. I compared every brand available on Amazon and am delighted I chose this one. It's compact size makes it simple to store in my little kitchen. Now I can make pizzelles in a hurry any time!"
2,A good upgrade,"Beyond the Sword is a nice expansion pack for the Civ IV game. There are the usual new leader and units provided as you would expect in a Civ upgrade, but there are many more enhancements. Spying is completely revamped and there are now Corporations to be built, which are similar in nature to religions in gameplay. Through corporate expansion, you can give a city a needed boost, at the expense of gold. Each country now gets a unique building enhancement in addition to a unique unit. The AI of the computer is a lot smarter than in the original game too, so watch out."
2,Great for Families to Read/Learn Local Legends Together,"Yes, Creepy Chicago culls stories from Bielski's first two books. It's a deliberate adaptation of her popular books for adults into a format for children--at the age at which most Chicagoland schoolkids learn Chicago history (3rd/4th grade). That could be why it didn't seem too, too creepy! That said, the book's writing and approach are sophisticated enough for older children--or even adults with limited time we're told!--to appreciate. Investigate first at your local library, and decide for yourself."
2,works as expected but........,I have no idea what the little phone cord thing and some sort of...attachment thing are for...once you remove them and just plug it in the wall its works as expected.
2,gets the job done.,this kit gets the job done at a very reasonable price. no case but for this price who cares?
2,A great change from tedious religious films,"Here's what there is to say: 1) Johnny Depp is terrific as Dean Corso, the man you hate but have to sympathize with. It's amazing how Depp can portray such a wide variety of characters. 2) The screenplay, for the most part, is what makes this movie. There are very few, if any, unnecessary scenes and elements like lighting are all very appropriate to mood and style. 3) It's not a horror film. Thank God. If this had been a cheesy horror flick I wouldn't have seen it. No ""dramatic buildup into nothingness"" as is too typical these days. 4) An interesting taken on Satanism without stereotyping everyone who takes an interest.The only problem with the film: A few ridiculous plot twists here and there. Where do they come from? Who knows."
2,Great Wasabi Peas!,"I have ordered the wasabi peas from two other companies. The wasabi peas from JR Mushrooms are the absolute best! Just the right amount of kick and no hard, break your teeth peas! Will definitely order from them again!"
2,How to play short handed,"This book is a really good book on how to play short handed. Most poker books discuss how to play premium hands against large fields of players. This is a book about how to play sub premium hands in situations where isolation is possible; that is situations where the opponents are tight and unimaginative.The strategy involved is:1) Play cards that will do well against the opponent's likely hands (since the opponents are tight these are limited)2) Play in position so you end up heads up3) Make sure your little cards are seen by the opponents so that you get an ""always plays junk / always bluffs"" reputation and thus win big with your big hands that come in due to lose calling.4) Play defensively so that you are unlikely to be bluffed atThe book is certainly original enough to warrant picking up for $20. I wish it were longer and more detailed but the author does also have a tournament practice book."
2,perfect combination,"This music is a nice composition which has both features of persian tarditional music, and western classical music."
2,"Good, but could be a little better.","I bought this remote to ease the use of my home theater...five remotes is annoying. I bought this unit, and programmed it the best I could. My Blu-ray player is from Korea and my HD satellite receiver is German; neither were in the available codes from the RF10's book.I programmed an odd array of button combinations and macro commands just to get the Blu-ray and sat receiver to work. Eventually, I gave up on using it for the satellite box and went back to their factory remote. Aside from the lack of codes for my non-US equipment, everything works well. I ordered one for my father, but it was too complicated for him...he went back to three separate remotes."
2,Very soft.,The seet is as promised. Soft and easy to sit on. I have a 3 wheel for running arround in the community.
2,My Husband's favorite non homemade cookie,"I first bought these at Meijer. Then, they stopped carrying them. I found them at Tuesday Morning but I am sure that is not a long time source. They are great. I think they are a more adult cookie, but I am sure children would like them too. I hope you will have them soon."
2,Life changing,"I can't imagine you or your relationships being the same after reading this book unless you refuse to try! It is entertaining as well as comforting to know you are not the only one that wants to improve their relationships. Can be applied to any relationships: friends, kids, the single life etc."
2,popcorn maker,This item is wonderful though a bit too small. It makes good popcorn and is very easy to use. It is worth the price and a good buy.
2,HITLER'S ALIVE?,"YES this is a totally weird & dumb movie to watch. But is fun to watch. The main plot seems to be a group of mensaving Hitler's brain so he can give instructions on how to take over the WORLD. [ I might say, good specialeffects on his head ]. This is truly a B-Movie. But oh so fun to watch. If you don't already have it, by allmeans get for good dumb entertainment."
2,Christmas gift,My niece loves it. Her camera fits perfect. The smile on her face was worth every penny I spent on this bag.
2,Truly a WONDERFUL ending to a great series!!!,"This book, being the last, also has my vote for being one of the best in this series. The complexity of the characters, yet easy to follow story line made it very hard to put down at all. The triumphant conclusion to this story had me wishing for more"
2,THIS BOOK IS A TREASURE.,This book will give you the confidence to explore the fun and artistry of crazy quilting. The steps in each of the projects is described and photographed in a simple and comprehensive manner. If you own one book about quilted bags make sure its this one.
2,Excellent!,"I love this cd! It's an improvement from her last one. Jessica's wonderful voice is so strong and powerful. I like every track on here, but my favorites are: 'Irresistibe, Just A Little Bit, What's It Gonna Be, I Never, and Imagination'(which is a cute song with a good beat.) 'There You Were' is a beautiful ballad and Jessica sings it so well with Marc Anthony. 'For Your Love' is beautiful, and Jessica sings it with such grace and emotion(she's good on the high notes!) This is a great cd(one that I'd recommend.)"
2,Wonderful,"This album is one of my favorites, Even though I have to import HIM's cd it's totally worth it. The members of the band are so talented and it really shows in this one. I hope that they will come to the U.S more often. This album is amazing!"
2,Very Handy reference material !,"This is a very useful book to have on-hand, near your Tarot collection. Sometimes, digging through Crowley's rants and digressions can be a bit time-consuming. It's nice to have a quick, easy reference guide to the Thoth deck. I have not yet compared the Crowley material to this book, but I have not noticed anything that seemed ""off,"" while using ""Keywords for the Crowley Tarot"" as a reference, while doing readings.I have noticed that most Newbies to the Thoth deck latch-onto this book, like a Prize ! Then, I return it to the shelf and tell them the ISBN #, so they can get their own copy.I'll, do a more thorough review, in the future. For now, I just want to give the authors Kudos for their work."
2,Levi's,"I love the jeans, only issue was I didn't realize I was getting button down and wanted a zipper. Oh well not paying for shipping to correct. Just wont order stuff on-line, too mush of a crap shoot."
2,Excellent all around printer and fax,"I would have bought this from Amazon, but it didn't qualify for Amazon Prime shipping. Instead, I picked it up at my local Staples. The only drawback is the expensive cartridges, but the entire machine is top-notched. I say this having purchased and returned 2 HP's."
2,No complaints!,Bowls work just fine in our (amazon purchased) IRIS Pet Wire 3-Tier Cat Cage. Bowls come out of holders easily to throw in dishwasher. No issues or complaints.
2,Number One on the NYT Nonfiction List with a bullet!,"I suppose the only thing that confounds liberals even more is that ""The Passion of the Christ"" soon to be the biggest film blockbuster of all time is #2 on the New York Times bestseller list for nonfiction.Great book, great voice for many who will be heard this November when the Flim Flam Man, John F. Kerry goes down in ignonimous defeat. Keep up the great work Sean and keep doing your part to defeat the unholy trinity of terrorism, despotism, and liberalism."
2,Very Nice!,An excellent German album. This artist is talented with a large variety of syles of music. If you are into Grimm fairy tales and Dracula you would probably like this.
2,"Pricey, but nice.","I bought mine at Best Buy for $70.I've got my 550d with the 18-55 kit lens, a 50mm 1.8 FD w/ converter, a Fisheye, a shotgun microphone, a flash bracket, a handle, and all of my cables and memory cards with room to spare.It holds the tripod pretty nicely. If I ever fly with my camera, I'm taking this bag.The bag's strap is actually a bit too long, I prefer messenger style bags to be midway up my back, since I ride a bicycle frequently. This makes the bag less likely to slide around on my back, and less likely to be shaken from bumps. With the strap fully retracted, it reaches my waist, and I'm about 5'9""."
2,The Best Dana Doll So Far,"I got this doll for my birthday and I 've played with it ever since! I t's makup is so pretty. The glitter and hair, all great! Although I'm turning 11 this year I still love Bratz dolls. and if your looking to buy your daughter a WinterTime WonderLand doll this is the one!Bye peeps,Michelle!"
2,Great packs,"The casings are thick, like a super premium grade pool raft or wave-less water bed mattress or something. The gel inside firms up but stays softish. I would call it a premium grade ice-pack; if you're through screwing around with crappy quality ones.."
2,Great Cover,"This item works great, i'm stationed in Iraq and my equipment gets banged around all day, this cover really helps."
2,WOW,This is a great DVD. She can really pack a lot into 10 minutes.Very challenging. Only small complaint is there is not enough stretching so I just do a few minutes on my own.
2,DIANA GOES BACK...KIND OF,"Let me just say that I have been anticipating this book ever since word leaked out about its existence. For Diana Ross fans, this is the ultimate tour book. Wonderful photos (many never before seen) show the versatility that has placed Diana among the top icons of our time. The book does lose a few points because there are very few photos from before 1976, which totally ignores the Supremes years, an almost unforgiveable sin. There are also no onstage photos (except for Central Park) or shots of Diana with other celebrities. Not to mention very few family photos. A title such as GOING BACK would lead one to expect photos from Diana' entire life and career. However, this is not the case with this book. For the die-hards, it probably won't matter."
2,Bought as a gift.,My husband loves this lighter. Price was great shipped on time. I did think the design was etching but is just painted on lost one star for that but no complaint s other than that.
2,THE MONEY ROOM,"I think this is a wonderful book. I've read it at least seven times. At the beginning, Scott and his sister move in their mother's uncle's house. They hear about a ""money room"" and decide to search for it. They meet a few friends along the way, and solve the mystery of who's been messing around on their property. They find a tin box in the attic full of money, but later their parrot ""accidently"" finds the real money room..."
2,Uncle Tom Andy Bill; A Story of Bears and Indian Treasure,"I very much enjoyed this book, I know it was intended for a younger reader but it is was a real delight to read."
2,Before Chick Ruined Fusion,"Yo, Chick! Yanni called - he said thanks for the how-to manual. Like how to make overwrought bombast. Check out any ""Elektric Band"" offering and hear for yourselves.However, RTF is almost beautiful: graceful, passionate yet trippy. Thank goodness for Stanley Clarke, Joe Farrell & Airto. Their masterful restraint, their willingness to let the music breathe, saves the album. Seriously, was Chick having an affair with Flora Purim, or did he lose a bet? Having her ""sing"" on this smells of blackmail material."
2,Hours of Fun!,"SSX is a great game that will give you many hours of fun. The last time I owned a video game system, was the original Sega. No Nintendo nor PS1 were ever mine. I was hesitant to buy a PS2 because it honestly takes about $500 to get set up to play. Finally, I took the plunge, and SSX is the first game I have bought. It has blown me away, and I have no regrets about buying the system now. The game is immediately playable because the controls are not hyper-twitchy, you really have to make an effort to make your character wreck. Although it is easy to pick up the basic concept, there is layer upon layer available to improve your game. I love it."
2,Hawking 8db USB dish,"Most of the time my laptop can get a strong wifi signal but due to the far distance away from the Station, the laptop is not able to emit a powerful enough signal to communicate with Station.The Hawkings 8db dish really works, it boost and improves the signal from my laptop to the station and I'm able to get and receive signals even when I'm 200m away.The only disadvantage is , u have to know the direction of where the signal is coming from. or the Hawking will not be able to preform."
2,SERI MILLENNIUM 21,Nana Mouskouri has the most beautiful voice in the whole world.Very clear very smooth and very very beautiful.
2,Perfect Toast,"We recently purchased the T-Fal Avante four slice toaster after searching many different brands. I selected the T-Fal as the style was different since the toast is easy to see while preparing. I get a lot of compliments on the design. The bagel function toasts bagels to perfection. Construction is good quality not tinny as many models are. This toaster is able to handle wide toast securely so it toasts evenly. The release button brings the toast to the top without having to dig into the toaster. The toaster is somewhat large if you have small counter space, but I feel it is worth the size."
2,A Good Survey Text,"I happened to see this text in the publishers store new in hard cover. It is an English translation (Barnes & Noble, 2000) from the French (La civilization de l'Occident medieval by B. Arthaud, Paris, 1964; English translation by Basil Blackwell, Ltd., 1988)with an updated bibliography. It is a good survey of the period and allows for insight into modern history of the West. I obtained it to have on hand for not only myself, but the grandchildren who may be exposed to more ""revisionist history."" The price was great in store at $12.98 when it was originally published at nearly three times the price."
2,good family movie,awesome to watch with all age groups - funny with enough to keep parents laughing and enjoying as well as small children to teenagers.
2,Great relief!,"Aside from fast delivery and great service, the wrap itself was extraordinary. It provided great relief to the hamstring and prevented further injury. Actually, it allowed me to recover sufficiently to achieve a personal best in the long jump."
2,"don,t miss this movie","excellent movie, this movie arrived on time loved it if you have not seen it don,t miss the action please."
2,Kauai Cookbook (used),We purchased three used copies for members of the family. Sellers were associated with Amazon. These cookbooks help the novice prepare Hawaiian/Asian foods from Hawaii and the island of Kauai. A great book!
2,Most comfortable memory foam ever!,"Unfortunately, I've had four spine surgeries. Because of those surgeries and my continuous chronic pain, I've been searching high and low for the right bed. Well, I found the perfect memory foam bed for me, but I wanted just a little more ""plush"" feeling, which this topper provides. Honestly, I was expecting it to be pretty cheap feeling for the price and smell terrible like memory foam does, but when I received it, I found it to be the highest quality feeling and density foam I've ever felt, and boy, it honestly smelled SO good. It's infused with green tea to remove the horrible foam smell, which will fade with time. I wish it wouldn't. Well, maybe it's better now that I think of it as I'd like to eat my memory foam topper it smells so good. Don't hesitate. Buy it. Trust me. I don't say that unless I mean it. It's worth every penny."
2,Where's the zen?,"First, the book is well written. It is well written trash, but nevertheless the prose is magnificent. Yet my years of studying zen reveal no such correlation between this individual who has learned to not try is the best way to not succeed (ref. the story of climbing the mountain with his son). Unfortunately, he is trying to pass this message on to others. If the story was written with less talent one could see the flaws inherent in this philosophy. It is as if one desired Marilyn Monroe's lifestyle because she brought such penache to the screen. In the end the only real loser is one who quits, and that seems to be lost on Pirsig."
2,For the Sceptic,"A must read for anyone that values the scientific method. Let me remind readers that the scientific method was designed to correct the biases of the scientist, NOT TO SUPPORT ANY PARTICULAR DOGMA. Before you buy any of the chiropractic party line, I would encourage you to seek out as much information as possible. And I believe that a good place to start is with Dr Magner's book."
2,Finally!!,"Every since they came out with DVD, I've been looking for this title....pratically every month, I ask at the local video sellers and lo & behold, here it is! This movie is the absolute best in sci-fi, the movie that started it all! The special effects, the story, the fleeting glimpse of aliens - this movie is IT!! Sylvia!!"
2,So much better on CD,The book was hard to read. I got the CDs and I thoroughly enjoyed the story/plot. I watched the movie afterwards and was so glad that I listened to the story first.
2,I LOVE THIS SHEET SET AND SO WILL YOU,I am a sheet snob. I love this sheet set. They are so shabby n chic and are oh so soft. They wash well. The color is absolutely beautiful. I love the way they fit my oversized mattress and have the elastic all the way around. I could talk for hours about this sheet set. If you buy it you will not be sorry. I am back to buy more for gifts too. annie
2,Excellent light source,"Lantern works very well, providing good bright light, much better than battery lanterns. Burning the mantles prior to use is a little tricky, however, best done with a lighter or long wooden matches."
2,These run big,"VERY nice shoe. These do seem to run about half of a size big, though. The brown pair has different shades of brown color (obviously intential) throughout the shoe. I like that they are not a solid color and I have had several compliments on them."
2,"Wasn't SCOTCH Brand as Advertised, but Works the Same.","Found it odd that it wasn't SCOTCH brand as the picture and title indicated. But, it's still tape and will do the job of taping up packages. So, 5 stars still."
2,Still a Classic,This movie still holds a special place in my movie collection. This will always be a classic in my collection. Great Movie and almost makes it one I would share with my family.
2,Superb!,"I love this show and I'm a sucker for almost anything HBO puts on my television. I loved Entourage and own all the seasons but, Entourage is a very unrealistic show for the average viewer. That is why, I believe, I loved ""How to Make it in America"" a bit more. The characters are funny, deep, determined but just like most people....they get knocked off course. This show is highly underrated and I'm so excited to finally own this one!"
2,"Clever Arrangements, Haunting Vocals","This is an album not to miss. It's a creative mix of covers with very hip arrangements allowing Dave's technology to be tempered by the warm humanity of Barbara's voice. If I had to knock it, I'd say it didn't have enough rough edges, yet Eight Miles High is a brilliant rethinking of the Byrds' classic. This and others have a way of staying with you, and you'll find yourself humming, if not singing along outright."
2,Timely & thought provoking!,"Bailey has distilled the issues of privacy and security in the 21st century into a very readable and informative work! I highly recommend The Open Society Paradox to scholars, policy makers, and any citizen concerned with the security of our nation and world. This book offers a fresh perspective on privacy and openness that is sure to initiate constructive debate on what may become the most shaping issue of our century.Read this book!!"
2,"Fun, breezy jazz to chill out by","Most mellow jazz puts me to sleep but this perky collection turns me on in all the right ways. A friend gave me this CD last year for the holidays and now it's number one on my list of ""chill"" CDs. It stays in my five-tray CD player (#3) and it's the first button I press when I come after work because it lightens me instantly and helps me shake off the day. It's subtle enough to blend with any evening - from a 1:1 romantic dinner, a Saturday afternoon potluck with the neighbors, to a drink with the girls from the office -- yet the melodies and instrumentation have sufficent depth and texture to grab your attention if all you want to do is listen and groove. This is my gift to all my friends this year."
2,My FAVORITE earphone ever,This earpiece is the best earpiece around - the volume is sufficient for ALL to hear from & the clarity when speaking is better than my handsfree home phone (which is very good). Everyone can understand me and I can hear everyone. The ear gells that come with it are easy to use - I'm not a big person so I need a smaller gell to fit comfortable for hours but I can use the standard that comes with this unit for a shorter time.
2,Quality pop,"Ronan Keating's debute doesn't re-innovate pop music, but it still is a very enjoyable and stylish sample of it. 'Ronan' is much better and consists far more grown-up music than the average Boyzone-album. Of course most of these songs are love songs, but they are not as stroppy and the texts have more contents than you could expect from the singer of a boyband. The major charm of this album is that Keating doesn't copy Boyzone-songs or other styles, or that he doesn't use all the cliché's and the tricks possible to make a pop song. He tries to find his own, adult style, in which he succeeds quite well by combining nice pop music with traditional Irish elements. At that, this album contains two really outstanding songs, ""Life is a Rollercoaster"", a quite original song at that, plus ""When You Say Nothing at All"", a beautiful ballad. Also ""Heal Me"" is very nice. Ronan Keating has also a really nice voice and hey, without wanting to sound pathetic: he's got the looks! :-)"
2,Great Classic,"This novel is the story of not only Anna Karenina, and how one decision has such a disastrous impact on her life; it is the inter-twining stories of her relatives and friends living in the Russian aristocracy. This is a story about relationships, and opinions, and it explores how they are never clear-cut; and how opinions and feelings can and will change over time.I have been wanting to read this book for a long time. But the size of the book and the Russian names made me put the book down. I decided to give the book a try and am so glad I did. One of the best classics out there."
2,It seems to make the ladies smile.,"My girlfriend told me, ""This smells soft and delicious. I believe that this is what the angels in heaven smell like. Seriously it's that good. I was going to buy the Donna Karen Cashmere Mist because it has a soft scent but then I found this in a rite aid store and I never went back to DK. You just can beat the smell or price. $60-$80 bucks or $6.99 and smelling like heaven?? hmm not hard to decide.""So I would recommend buying this product. It seems to make the ladies smile."
2,Once Upon a Time,"A lovely piece of work. This film isn't for everyone,it's too special. There will be a day when you discover the meaning, you may be young and understand this story or old and can relate to its symbolism. Your time will come. Like all good art, the Polish brothers will be dead when this movie is most appreciated."
2,Library of Congress says...,"Book of Mormon is the 8th most influential book, after the Bible (#1), The Road Less Traveled (#3), and How to Win Friends & Influence People (#7). I've read them all multiple times and they all belong on the list. If you don't want positive influence in your life then PLEASE do not read the Book of Mormon."
2,"Entertaining, screwball dark comedy","A straight laced couple, surrounded by debauched swingers, dream of opening a restaurant. After a number of setbacks, they hit on a sinister and amusing way of raising cash.This is a very off the wall movie, and it's well worth seeing.Sherlock Holmes and the Flying Zombie Death Monkeys"
2,Great Live Renditions,"Great Live renditions of some awesome song, I think this CD more than any other of DMB's truly brings out the awesome musical talent of Dave Matthews and Tim Reynolds. The acoustic quality is simply amazing and sounds great on just about any system."
2,"OK, Uglies, let's see what you got","The second part of the White Mountain series, Will and his companions embark on a dangerous mission to inflirate the mysterious Tripod city.They are joined by a German boy, Fritz, and Will and Fritz make it into the city. There they discover the true nature of the Tripods. Meanwhile they work as slaves to the Masters. Together they learn of the secret plans for the world.This book expands upon Will's nature and contrasts him well with Fritz. It also provides an excellent contrasts between the humans and Masters.Like the first story, this will inspire and entertain young readers and continue to entertain older ones."
2,Koss quality for a low price.,"After having my first set for six months, I now have two sets that I use on both my work and home computers.Pros:1) Long cord allows for easy computer use.2) Designed with ear padding to both comfort and block most sounds around an office.3) Solid design allows you to literally throw these headphones around without worry of breaking."
2,Awesome,"This CD is awesome! When I heard ""Right Now"" I didn't know what punk rock was. But if you know what it is listen to this CD before you buy it."
2,KY Sunglasses Blue,Beautiful glasses! These were a gift for husband and didn't fit him very well so I had to return. Company and product were great!
2,Does a great job,"This product has made music and gaming sound come alive in my house. I would say the quality is very, very good overall; and downright brilliant if you factor in the price."
2,Tracks are...,"1. Blue Skies (2:26) 2. I Love You (2:17) 3. Goodbye Sue (3:34) 4. Aren't You Glad You're You (2:18) 5. Here Comes Heaven Again (3:10) 6. All Through The Day (3:12) 7.

2,Super Mario Bros. 3,Great game. One of my favorite Nintendo games. My kids even enjoy playing it as much as I did when I was a kid. Love it.
2,The Emperess,"Romy Schnider is so good in this you will really believe she is Elizabeth, the costumes are extreemly acurate too. this is a must for anyone who is a classic movie collector, a period film fan, or anyone wo likes a good romance. Even my boyfriend likes this movie!"
2,Early D-Day Movie,"This 1950's movie is ""B"" Movie about a US Infantry Company before, on and after the D-Day Invasion of Normandy in 1944. There aren't any special effects, but there is alot newsreel footage spliced into the movie. This movie mostly concreates on what happens after the D-Day Invasion and the build up to the breakout of the Normandy Beachheads. It's ok, but its not ""Saving Private Ryan""."
2,Great starting at age 3!,"We bought this a couple of years ago when our son was 3. It was a bit advanced at the time, but he loved trying to play it anyway. As he has grown, it has stayed a favorite in our house. The original games we bought have become educational at different levels and there are always new games. We only own 4 games and he is never bored with it. I think it is a great gift for boy or girl ages 3-6 and feel it is something they will use for years.I do recommend getting the charging station, as batteries tend to wear out. We bring the charging station on trips so we can charge it before the next car ride.We don't have any other accessories, but it would be nice to have a container that holds the Leapster and the games together.If you have someone under 3, the My First LeapPad was great and we passed it on to our younger child when our first upgraded to the Leapster."
2,Could as well be five stars,"One more artist I had never heard before. But the album was absolutely a positive experience. Beautiful voice and good songs - couple of those were slightly ""standard"" productions but the most had a good twist (not a musical term here) in them. Either in lyrics or in arrangement. Or both. Definitely also an album which gets better each time one listens to it. Must buy more Tift. Supposed to make me happy, supposed to make me happy, all the time.Stars should be four and a half (or three quarters)."
2,Germany-USA link,"We discovered GRANDLOVING's 1st version by chance many years ago and contributed with a small idea about a typical German Xmas tree decoration. In the meantime our own children left Europe to live in the US. Our family keeps growing and our grandchildren live now in Florida. Thanks to Grandloving's ever growing new ideas we can keep in touch through personally made objects that we exchange and show each other and tell stories about when connected via Skype. We are all very grateful to the Johnsons for keeping up the good work. Jean-Patrick (+ late Elly), Kerstin, Trent, Arlette, Enzo and Leo."
2,A great book for all skill levels!,"Golf By Design is a breath of fresh air compared to many other golf books that are being sold today. What better way could you learn about how to play a course than from one of the world's greatest designers?From the different types of climates, grasses, bunkers and terrain, Jones gives excellent examples of what goes through a designer's mind while creating a course. By using some of the world's most beautiful and challenging holes, he suggests the diffeent strategies that can be applied while playing to allow golfers of all levels to lower their scores.Whether you are a scratch golfer or a hacker, Golf By Design will definitely help you in this most challenging of games."
2,Read this reveiw,"Wow!! That is what I can say about this book. Wonderful, Awsome, I totaly loved this book that keeps you geussing. Christy Tood and katie are off to Europe with Antonio. Seeing many wonderful sights christy is still trying to deal with doubts and anixty. Read it!Read it!Read it!Read it!Read it!Read it!Read it!Read it!Read it! Ok you get the point. Read it!Read it!Read it!Read it! I really mean it! Read it!"
2,it is the best video animation ever.by ishmael boddie queens,iwant more episoides of the guyver.please make some more or sell them again in queens of new york city.i also like the concept of the guyver.you would be a big success if you came on television inthe united states(new york city in particular).but you might have to calm down with the blood.
2,Looks GREAT,"This collection, though a little pricey, is a must have for any Peanuts fan. It has the three major holiday specials, plus a bonus special on each disk, not to mentions a special featurette on each disk. The Christmas special also comes with a bonus CD music sampler. And each disk also has coupons for free itunes downloads of songs.So, all those little extras make the cost seem a bit less.But the true greatness of this collection is how the cartoons look. They are cleaned up quite a bit, and sound great. If you have only ever watched these specials on TV, you're in for a treat."
2,"A thoughtful, balanced assessment","Beware of highly negative reviews! Abanes has produced a careful, thorough critique of some of the most significant groups of our day. Of particular value are the chapters on Scientology, the Nation of Islam, and The Family (Children of God), which few evangelical researchers have been able (or willing) to tackle in this kind of work. Balanced and biblically sound, this book is strongly recommended to all readers."
2,It's Taken a Beating - and Keeps Going.,"I was looking to replace the cutter assembly after six years of serious use/abuse, when I came across the reviews of this blender. I am absolutely surprised by the number of bad reviews (about 1/3). I've had this blender for over 6 years and use it 4-5 x's per week (frozen fruit/ice/protein smoothies mostly). It gets a beating, and I have not had one ounce of trouble with it. I wonder why the huge discrepancy? I love this blender - have the stainless steel model."
2,Very Good Video,"My computer was equipped with a video card made by a competing manufacturer and since I use Linux as my operating system, it would not work right. They have no drivers for Linux. I installed this GForce card in my computer and it works perfectly. It is fast and does a good job with whatever I throw at it. I like to watch DVD's sometimes and it does very well with that also."
2,Completely Satisfied,"Love this bowl: just the right size for passing around the table, serving food to a family of four and storing conveniently in the cupboard. Love the cream color with green rim. It's also the perfect size for a large green salad for one person when the salad is the meal (like in a restaurant). We now own six for that purpose!"
2,Great start for beginners,"I enjoyed building this gundam, as it was my first one. I received aGundam MSN-06S Sinanju Ver Ka Titanium Finish MG 1/100 Scalethat was purchased at Comic Con from my best friends as a christmas gift. I did not want to mess it up, so I wanted to purchase a lower quality, but decent model to practice on. This was perfect for my needs, great price for a HG. It was fun building it, and most of the colors were accurate. Although I liked the finished look, you can try painting it to look better to your preference. It is highly recommended to useTamiya Basic Tool Set - MK816to build any of your models. It makes things much smoother and time saving. I purchased this through Winsum Leong."
2,A personal insight to physical and mental perseverance.,"Bob Holtel captures the essence of all essential ingredients that combine to produce an envied athletic endurance achievement. For anyone who has rested on their own laurels of completing a marathon or two, only they can truly appreciate Bob's accomplishment - Running four consecutive marathons every week, 12 weeks straight for three consecutive summers, on uneven rocky trails and at altitude!!! The solitude of it all, the courage to run with pain and complete the task at hand, the enjoyment of simple pleasures of mountain running - these are all brought home in vivid detail through this account. As an athlete I am honored to have shared the adventure. This book has produced a new hero who has proved again that with vision, preparation, planning and courage you can accomplish your dreams."
2,Helped me understand my grandson better.,"I purchased this book in order to help understand my grandson better. He has not been diagnosed as autistic, but has some of the tendencies of autism. This book is well written, and looks at autism from the child point of view. I will relate much better to my grandson now."
2,The most beautiful and devastating book that I've read....,"It's been said: ""There are people who take the heart out of you, and there are people who put it back.""Al and Jane Nakatani have turned their hearts inside out for the world to see...and Molly Fumia, as their story's conduit, treats those hearts with the tenderest, utmost respect. I find it difficult to convey how deeply moved I am by the infinite losses this family has suffered, and by the love and blessings that they have chosen to offer the world out of their broken-open hearts. *Please* read this book, and follow its most courageous lead: Honour your children, whoever they may be!"
2,Good movie,I am surprised more people don't know about this movie. I think it a very good movie. Good children's movie.
2,SUPER ZEBRA BLANKET,"This blanket is amazing. When I received it, it was soft but then I washed it and put some fabric softener. OMG! It is amazing. So soft and comfortable! I cannot compare to any other blanket, it is perfect. I do suggest that you wash and dry on low before use. Super great blanket for a great price!!"
2,Could be more detailed,"These maps are almost essential if you have an etrek unit. The maps that come with the etrek are woefully deficient and you need to upgrade them. But even these maps could be more detailed especially for the hiker or geocacher. For topographical maps, these are not very detailed and if you want to route plan cross country you will need much more detailed maps. However depending on what maps you get, you can set waypoints on the more detailed maps and transfer them to the etrek and they will overlay the Mapsource maps."
2,Classical Gas is still a gas,"This rendition of this ""classic"" with Mannheim Steamroller is well done. However, most of the other songs are more Mannheim than Mason Williams. Since I like both, this is not a problem for me, but I wish there had been a little more classical guitar in it."
2,Gift for grandkids,"got the orginal book for the grandkids at Christmas, so i just had to start their Kotzwinkle library with a second book. Walter is becoming a beloved friend of the family. Thanks"
2,...and that dog WAS a mansonfan!,"mansonfan probably fancies himself a ""hardcore metalhead""of somthing of the sort,eh?educate yo self and listen to some kronos quartet or cynic-then you'll be ready for the onslaught that is dying fetus!(get all their cd's.they're all just as good!)"
2,Good material,"It's a very solid envelope. I ordered a bunch for my boss and he approves, so I guess that counts for something."
2,Wonderful Small Office Machine,Purchased this machine to replace 3 older machines in my home office. The printer is crisp and fast. Setup was easy. Even the network access was easy and working out of the box. The Scanner makes clean prints and the document feeder works great.
2,This movie is insane!,"I really like this movie! It shipped right away and I received it when I was told I would. This movie is really crazy and sometimes I ask myself ""Did that really just happen?"" But I received a brand new copy of this movie and it was in pretty good condition. I've already watched it and there were no problems as far as I am concerned."
2,Good for residential use,"Functions well enough to hang shelves, pictures, etc. but I have received a few ""false positives"" from both the electrical sniffer and studs sensor. I would recommend doing multiple passes to confirm before drilling, or go with a different product if you want to ""one and done"" it.The laser level works perfectly, but like other reviewers have noted it can be a bit frustrating putting a pin hole in the wall to hang a picture right beside the pin hole.Despite those minor things, this is a good product and worth the money. I would not recommend for any application beyond decorative household use."
2,one of the best,"yes one of the most underated,smooth jazz artists around at this pont in time,but this cd andthe great songs that are on it,will certainly put him to the top,with allthe other great performers of this genre of music,simply amazing.."
2,My most favorite writter.,"I havn't read it yet but I've waited 30 years for a seaqual to The Flame and The Flower, which was the very first romance novel I ever read and I was hooked from then on. I hope this seaqual will up to her talent and my expetations! If it dose it will be a very good read, one you won't want to put down or end either."
2,Great Stocking Stuffer,super cute piggy- will make a little girl very happy to play her own 3d version of angry birds this Christmas!
2,Very well written.,This was a very powerful read. It also gave me some insight into the Mexican history within the US. High school kids should have to read this.
2,Great for beginning readers,"My son is just learning to read, and the rebus (picture) format lets him read at a more interesting level than ""Pat sat on the hat."" He's a real Scooby-Doo fan, and he loved this book. He insists I have to buy the rest of the series. It's good practice for him, but it doesn't feel like schoolwork."
2,Sweet,i have been trying to find this show online and its not available. But with amazon prime its amazing to be able to watch it again.
2,"If parenthood is on your mind, you'll love this book","I am a young woman who is thinking a lot about having a child and what that will mean in my life. I am also in a relationship with a partner who is not as ""interested"" right now as I am in this huge topic. I turned to this book for ""conversations"" on parenthood and that is exactly what it offered. Maybe Baby includes many different ideas about having and not having kids and the uncertainty in between. I found these essays to be entertaining and thought provoking; I look forward to passing this book on to my partner and discussing our favorite installments."
2,THE BEST SITCOM OF ALL TIME ON DVD!!!,"IT'S LONG OVERDUE THAT THE BEST SITCOM OF ALL TIME FINALLY BE RELEASED ON DVD! UNFORTUNATELY, IT IS NOT A COMPLETE SEASON OF THE SERIES!I HAVE ALL 202 EPISODES OF THE SERIES ON VIDEOTAPE AND HAVE TAKEN THE TIME TO TRANSFER THE ENTIRE SERIES TO DVD MYSELF... BECAUSE IT HAS AND ALWAYS WILL BE MY FAVORITE PROGRAM!!THERE WILL NEVER BE ANOTHER SITCOM LIKE THIS AGAIN!REGARDLESS OF THE TIME AND WORK IT TOOK COMPILING A 42 DVD SET, I AWAIT THIS SERIES TO BE RELEASED BY THE SEASON ON DVD!!HOPEFULLY THE RELEASE OF THE SERIES TO DVD WILL INTRODUCE PEOPLE UNFAMILIAR WITH IT TO THE UNIQUE QUALITY OF THE SERIES!AS A TRUE ""DEDICATED"" FAN OF ALICE, I AM GLAD TO FINALLY SEE IT ON DVD!!"
2,The Lord is High and Lifted Up ...,"That's what Bishop McClendon and the Harvest Fire Mega Mass Choir let you know! I purchased both the CD and the Video about three months ago, and I listen to the CD daily. ALL of the songs are anointed by the Holy Ghost; however, the ones that really usher me into the presence of the Living God are ""I Came To Magnify The Lord""; ""There Is A Fountain""; ""All Hail The Power""; and ""Lord You Are Welcome""--WOW, what an awesome, awesome work! Bishop McClendon and COTH are anointed of God. By this piece, there is no mistaking or doubting that fact. All I can say is: get the CD, get the tape, get the video and SHOUT HALLELUJAH!!"
2,Great Spoon,Heavy duty. Reaches deep & great for stock pots & canning. I'm using for Christmas gifts this year. Merry Christmas!
2,Love it,"I wanted to add a few more serving pieces to my collection. I love the design because it's simple, but not boring."
2,Works for me.,"I suffer with gout and when it hits, it hits HARD and is very painful.Since taking this product randomly, the attacks have ceased. I haven'thad a gout attack since taking this. I really do recommend you try it.It sure has helped me and again Amazon was right on top of my order. Thank you."
2,WOW!!,"This is primal, primitive, 1960's brutal garage music. Low fi production. Best album of the century so far. It's BRUTAL. If in '65 some dudes took a few drugs, heard ""You Really Got Me"" by the Kinks, picked up on underground music by the Sonics, maybe also the Wailers, and they ran into the garage with a cassette recorder, way more enthusiasm than skills, it would sound like this. It should, at least. Nothing pretty about this, man, it will rock your skull off. Better than the Hives or the Stripes! I thought it couldn't be done today, but BAM! Here it is! Byu ten copies at least."
2,"Barabbas examines the notion of being ""tied"" to another huma","Barabbas, although essentially the untold story of the acquited Barabbas, also examines the existential notion of being tied to another person, a la Waiting for Godot. The novel also employs the motif of the doppelganger in the figures of Christ, the hare-lip girl, and Sahek(sp.?), all of whom exhibit modes of faith and understanding which are incomprehensible to Barabbas. Barrabas cannot believe, essentially because he doubts, but ""wants to believe"" in order to justify his own existence. Without this struggle he remains only a name on the lips of the faithful. Barabbas' struggle represents, in parable form, the human need for meaning in a meaningless world."
2,Love the design,"It was a spontaneous buy I made for our son when he was ~3 months old and it proved to be a great buy! Our son loves to play with the monkey, frog, bird etc and enjoys the blue light falls. His fascination with this has not faded in spite he being ~11 months old now (i.e. 8 months of seeing this bouncer day in day out), which speaks to the creative / attractive design of Fisherprice. Couple of things I'm not impressed with: 1) the mechanism does make some noise as the monkey / frog moves up and down; 2) the vibration is not powerful enough to make baby sleep and 3) the price ~40 bucks is still too high relative to other competitive products in the market. But overall, I'd give it a solid rating. Recommended buy!"
2,My son loves the color,This was bought for my 11yr old son. He has some disabilites so he is unable to ride a 2 wheel bike. His old 3 wheeler was not going to last much long & it was too small. He received this bike for Christmas and loves it!! It has been very cold & snowy here since Christmas so he has not had a chance to ride it a lot. The only thing he would change is to make it a 3 speed to make it easier going up hills (we have a lot of them) but it will not stop him from riding. Great product.
2,Great Case,"This is just the case I was looking for. It fits my wii system, contollers and power cords. Everythings a nice fit. I can even fit all my games in there, when i put them in jewel cases. The only drawback is the wii is hard to take out once you put it in. I read a review recommending that you can put a ribbon under it so its easier to take out. I've tried this and it works. The case is stylish too."
2,extension,a must have. This tool works well and used daily. It has held up to everything thrown at it. I'm very happy with it.
2,An innovative approach to portfolio construction,"This is a breakthrough investment book. Tanous has figured out why the vast majority of investors can't get rich simply by following someone else's advice. The ingenious test which determines investment personality works with scary accuracy, based on the tests we did with a number of friends and colleagues. The investment advice is very sound and well grounded, and the portfolios in the back of the book offer a much more sophisticated approach to portfolio creation than I have seen before. I admit, it took more careful reading to understand some of the intricacies of these portfolios, but the effort was well worth it. I recommend this book highly for those who want to create an intelligent and well-balanced portfolio of stocks or mutual funds geared to their own personality as investors."
2,Detoxify or Die Review,"Excellent book. Very informative. Gives an insight into the hoards of toxins we are subjected to on a daily basis and how we can detoxify them. When Dr's don't know what is wrong, detoxifying plastics, heavy metals, pesticides etc, can make you well again."
2,ThinkFun games are great!,These games are great. I've stocked up for cottages and family trips. Love that you don't need batteries. Skill required can be challenging too.
2,Visit Playland,"In the book Underground, the main character Is tries to find her missing cousin, Arun, in the city of London. She later finds out that more than half of the children are gone and they are going to a place called Playland.I liked this book a lot since I thought most of the clues were different and more clever than other types of mysteries. The book was also easy to read for me which makes the book a lot better.I don't usually read a lot of mysteries , but compared to the ones I did read this book is just as good. I would give this book a 5 out of 5, or 5 stars in this case."
2,currently the best book on the topic,"After finding only a few informative websites about destination weddings, I was pleased to happen upon this book at my local Barnes & Noble. It's a small book geared towards the internet savvy bride/groom-to-be, full of url's and references to their own website (which is pretty much blank and 'under construction').Maybe I've done more online research than most, but I didn't read anything new here. Yes, it's nicely organized and if you've just recently begun to consider eloping and/or haven't hit the 'net, this is a great starting point.I would have given it 5 stars if the content was a bit more in depth. Currently it reads more like what should be on their website rather than a full-length book."
2,A Great Science Fiction Book for Kids,"If you enjoy science fiction books, then you should read When The Tripods Came. This must read book is a story about a boy named Laurie living in a world that was recently taken over by giant tripods. These mechanical monsters are quickly destroyed but not before they manage to hypnotize most of the planet's population. The world is taken over; Laurie, his family, and his friend, Andy flee from England where they were living. They go to live with Laurie's stepmom who left to stay with Laurie's grandma and ill grandpa. The small town where they had sought refuge is quickly taken over and they are forced to seek refuge in the mountains. Can they survive in a world conquered by tripods? To find out read the series.If you like science fiction, adventure, and friendship, you have to read this book. This book is only one in a series of four. I enjoyed this book and I think you will too."
2,The GREATEST weightloss pill ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I love NV I use it every day, just one pill every six hours and 4 bottles of water. how easy is that. my mother and I love the stuff we just bought 5 bottles. I Lost about 10lbs in just a little over a month on this stuff. as long as they keep making it I'll keep buying it!! I would recommend NV to anyone wanting to lose weight. it controls hunger, and gives you a burst of energy to get through your day!! It helps your skin, hair, and nails!! ~Nv Be Desired~"
2,Classic 1966 album on CD,"I have been collecting records for almost 30 years and one of the first albums of Bucks I found was this one. It showcases Buck and the Buckaroos at the height of their popularity. Buck and Don Richs perfect harmony is here, along with Dons fiddle and Tom Brumleys steel guitar. There is solos from Doyle Holly and multi-talented Don Rich. A good album which ironically contains no hits but still a gem. Vintage west coast country with a couple of bonus tracks."
2,Classic,"What can I say? It is a classic. I found a little trouble with the compositing, but overall, it was still a good movie."
2,NIce Tea,"I bought this tea because Trader Joe's discontinued its Orange Spice Rooibos, which I absolutely loved. It's not as good, but still very nice. I drink it all the time."
2,BMW Manual hits homerun.,"Manual has saved me hours of valuable time.I have learned many procedures and shortcuts that helped me in diagnosis and repairs.When I don't have time to do the repair myself, I loan the manual to my mechanic.I recommend it to any owner, whether they do any repairs themselves or want a extremly detailed manual."
2,Simply perfect for the money,"As above, they simply sound great for the money. And they have a volume thing in the wire, witch is great for when you have the ipod in the pocket or something. When I got this thing I also got sony and Griffins ""earphones"" but I didn't like those fittings at all. I only use this now."
2,Veil of Duality,"After reading this book, I purchased 4 more copies. One for each of my daughters and one to share. We all love this book. It provides a positive insight to our present world. I would recommend this book for everyone. We could all benefit from this knowledge. Need I say more."
2,Two B-Movie Gems from the MGM Vault!,"MGM's been releasing these Midnite Movies double-features for awhile now, and we've seen some true goldens, along with some absolute slop.This new double-bill falls into the goldens, though you wouldn't think so to read the titles.The two of these films both intertwine the genres of monster-horror and noir-mystery, creating sometimes silly but always entertaining funhouse rides that you'll want to watch several times."
2,Good 'Ol George,"My favorite country star, George sings a smooth melody often intermingled with lyrics that play off words or phrases with more than one possible meaning. This isn't twangy country music, but it still comes with a heaping helping of fiddle, steel guitar, and good 'ol country-side accent."
2,Expect something unique from Irving!,I don't quite understand the less than favorable reviews for The Fourth Hand! John Irving is a gifted author who continues to evolve. This book is in a category all its own and should not be compared with any of his previous works. It entertains with an improbable story and unforgettable characters.
2,Booda Floppy - Awsome for Smokey,The quality of this item is awsome. The price for what you get is exceptional! Much better price than any pet stores! Try it. Your dog will love you for it!!!
2,terrifically entertaining,"Remember the old Agatha Christie books that began with a cast of characters/suspects? This book begins the same way -- which is fitting, since with Piercy the odd mix of characters is what propells the action, and the readers' interest. In this novel, seven or eight characters whirl through twelve-month's time in a small town on Cape Cod. Domestic bliss is challenged by the usual obstacles: envy, longing, and the common desires of the heart. Rifts arise between lovers and strangers come together. Small events set in motion the breakup of families. I didn't find the book especially deep or thought-provoking, but it's definitely entertaining -- something to read at the beach or on rainy evenings."
2,Great but...,I've been using this calculator for 2 weeks. It feels well constructed.The printed manual provided is not good enough if you want to write a program. Even the digital manual on the CD (that should be included in printed form) falls short on the programming side.The connectivity kit (conn4x) that came on the CD didn't work so I had to download the latest version from the HP site.Overall I recommend this product.
2,The Beatles' concerto,"The reviews here have already said much about how wonderful this album is. I just want to point out that the second side (on the original record) was a complete unit -- a densely packed, integrated, continuous musical form. I'm not aware of any group having done this. ""Tommy"" and other rock operas are in the same ballpark, but those have a much looser construction. The Beatles opened the door here, as they did so often in other aspects of their work, but no one else seems to have walked through it. A pity."
2,A Must Have Book,"I just finished reading The Better World Shopping Guide and I find it a very valuable tool to help assit me in making better shopping decisions from coffee to cars and from paper to cereal and everything in between.I agree with some reviews that I wish they gave me detail into why many of the companies got the grades that they did. But it's still a valuable tool to help you make better, more informed decisions when making purchases. I would rather purchase something from a company that believes in Fair Trade and is helping our envioment then a company who is not."
2,How can you give this any less??,"This album speaks volumes about one person's struggle with hatred/depression/hopelessness. That sounds very bad, but they do it with a very ""f... it lets rock"" attitude. It is nice to see that these guys actually put FEELINGS into their lyrics unlike some other crap that comes out now days. Granted, it is different that their first album, but damn worth picking up....keep it up guys!!!!!"
2,They Came to Blow Up America,"This a great war-drama movie based on an American FBI agent acting as an Nazi Saboteur to foil up the Nazi plans to blow up America using time bombs. This movie was released in 1943, is in b&w, runs for about 73mins and is in full frame. This movie stars; George Sanders, Anna Sten, Ward Bond, Dennis Hoey, Sig Ruman, Charles McGraw, plus others. There aren't any features on the disc only the feature film and Fox did a great job of transferring this and I hope to see more from movies from them being released. Overall this is a great movie and I would recommend this."
2,Good toy for tough dogs,"This football is pretty durable as rubber toys go. My dog, a German Short-hair Pointer, chews things up pretty quickly. This toy is quite flexible, fairly thick rubber, and though he does spend some time biting on it, he has yet to cut all the way through any part of it. There are some places where the cut goes partially through. It is easy to toss, but does not carry or roll very far. He likes to catch it when I toss it to him. But he is very big on FETCH. Then he likes to play keep away. So when I get my fingers into its holes, we have a game of tug. It works very well for us as an indoor toy. Took it outside once and it got quite dirty inside, so I rinsed it off thoroughly and it does not go outside anymore. He has a Kong Extreme Flyer for outdoor play. We are still working on his first football after about 3 months. I have a back-up in reserve, though."
2,Excellent,"Great product for the price, and good delivery service. Expiry date was even better that expected, Feb. 2012. I will certainly buy again."
2,Canning kit,I have been using this kit during canning season. The only thing that should be added is the piece to get out air bubbles.
2,Very cute and soft,This is the cutest Koala I have ever seen. Hes so so soft and easy to make. Comes with a birth certificate and 2 stars. I would buy him for anyone who loves Koalas.
2,Recommended for all IRIS fans,"Compared to IRIS which starts off running, the Athena series starts slow, but stick to it. Unlike IRIS there is not alot of effort to define the Athena organization. But, midway through the series it gets to a feverish pitch and the character development seen in IRIS kicks in. This is a very emotional story line. The main characters grow thoughout the series. Strongly recommend. Like IRIS you are glued to the show to see what happens to the main characters."
2,"4 step v groove pully 5/8"" bore","Your nomenclature is clumsy and inaccurate! Their is no such thing as a ""Bore V-Groove"" anything, much less this item. It is not clear if the groovs are 5/8"" or if the bore of the pulley is intended for a 5/8"" shaft. You need to make a selection possiable so as to allow those who need a 1/2"" bore for a 1/2"" shaft to get one...they are there but cannot be selected....it's take a 5/8"" and bush it or change shafting! VERY POOR..done by a person with no notion of what they were doing!!"
2,A M A Z I N G ! ! ! ! !,"Oooh man!!! I was love the first one, but this book is amazingly wonderful! Keith Code is a brilliant teacher and a great speaker.Keith Code clarifies all the obscure points and also he teaches you all the tricks for who wants to be a real good bike pilot."
2,Easy to install,"Easy to install and adds to the appearance of the truck. I believe they may come in different sizes even though they say they are all the same model. The first one I got was damaged in the mail (which was replaced by Amazon right away, excellent service I must say) this one was about 3/16 on an inch longer then the tail gate. The second one was about 1/4 inch shorter then the tail gate. Not a big deal, still looks good."
2,DIVE,"DIVE Book:oneFour divers named kaz,dante,adrina,and star arn't the bestdivers. But they were chosen to explore the sea on there summervaction.They sould be on the look for the dangorus sharks and other fish for this challange.________________________________________________________________When i was finish with this book diving semmed like fun,but kind of scary.I wanted to do it with my family some day.The bookwas brusting with action.Igive it a 4 out of 5.________________________________________________________________If you like fishes and lots of action this is the book for you and your freinds."
2,I am totally surprised BEST QUALITY! and so less price,"I bought this camera with wishes of quite good quality and I didn't know anything more but possibility of doing 2.0mpixels photos, some movies and I've been informed about the outputs only, The price made me ready to buy.And what? When I opened the box and took first photos I was totally shocked of extremely easy and proof photo system. Quality of pictures is very good. The colors are professional, nice and true, flash brights good and ppl look naturally (i had kodak cx4200 which took horrible pictures, ppl's skin looked so artificial)Also ISO is nice, with very bright lens and ISO to 200 is enough and pictures are clear and there is no noise.Everything automatic, and fast shot makes this camera very useful.Very good for ppl who need to have cam on standby, to shot fast pictures, family cam or cam for kids.Very good also for pictures in home. I haven't tried this cam to landscapes, but in home it works just perfect."
2,satisfied customer,My wife and I are very satisfied with product. Nice fit with plenty of her pleasure from one end to the other. For those with longer stamina the elasticity wears off after about 20 minutes. As long as you have a back up this is not a problem.
2,Darkness Rules,"As far as Sci-Fis go this is pretty good. It is cetainly better then ""Chronicles"" I believe this movie was Vin Diesel's first big break out role and does a good job planning, well a character you'd expect him to play. Definately a movie you should check out and it is worth owning."
2,"Well made, but short on plot.","I felt like more emphasis was made to jam as much action in with a little back story than on plot. Clearly foreshadowed another movie, but still a good relaunch of the series."
2,Its Gonna Be Me,This song is a great song as well as the video to it. It fits in with their whole concept behind the latest album and is very creative. the song is a lot of fun to hear and to watch and if you are as big an Nsync fan as I am- you will LOVE this single.
2,"Manager of the ""Honey Do"" list!","As the Manager of the critical ""Honey Do"" list that insures peace and tranquility for Life in the Castle, I need a great set of tools to get the job done. As my current tools have some age on them their performance is somewhat in question and that puts me in some peril. It has been a pleasure to launch project after project using such a reliable and powerfull tool like the Factory-Reconditioned DeWalt DW958K-2R 18-Volt 3/8"" Cordless Compact Drill/Driver Kit. Even as a novice I have been able to bring light to the Knights, brace up items that were Dragon and rescue the Damsel before the castle was seized by Dis Repair. I owe my Kingdom and life of leisure to the increatible power of the Factory-Reconditioned DeWalt DW958K-2R 18-Volt 3/8"" Cordless Compact Drill/Driver Kit. With the magic of this tool I will live happily ever after. Thank you Merlin for favors granted!"
2,Perfect,"This CD is perfect--to the point that I'm not sure she'll ever surpass it, although all of her CD's are great. The arrangements, the songs and the choice of songs, the production, and of course the voice--everything is in place like a finished puzzle. I was fortunate enough to see her ""ao vivo"" three times on the ""Barulhinho Bom"" (""Great Noise"") tour, and she is absolutely amazing."
2,don't lose it,"It is easy enough to use, but also easy to lose if you don't keep it readily available and visible."
2,Superior cracker,"These crackers taste like ritz crackers with less salt. They are absolutely wonderful. My husband who is not one that likes to spend money on gluten free products (as the person with Celiac in the family) said that he would go out and buy ten boxes any day of the week. They may not have as much salt as you would expect but the crispy, crunchy, buttery flavor is there. Not as much fat as in Ritz as well but certainly what is needed and a little extra to make a quality cracker. I don't think you will be disapointed."
2,Very pleased with this product,I'm huge on using parchment as it saves a lot of washing when baking or cooking. This is about the fourth type I've used because I generally buy in bulk when I find one I like. I was very satisfied with it and the tear off thing worked great. It was cheaper per sq foot than the larger package and I feel it was a good deal.
2,We use it as wait music at our pediatric clinic,"This is one of the funniest CDs we have. I usually get tired of kid music and crave adult stuff, but this is actually not an insult to my intelligence (or my kids'). Our favorites are ""Lisa Lee Elizabeth"" and ""Topologically Speaking."" In my opinion, Monty Harper has Raffi beat to pieces."
2,ms lx-3000 headset,"excellent headset. very comfortable, clear txmt and receive sound. very pleased. however, lifechat program somewhat confusing to me."
2,My partner loves it!,Read lots of reviews before purchasing. Not pricey and does the job very well. My partner is very happy with it!
2,Stan Rogers Own Living Memorial,"I drove my wife crazy playing The Mary Ellen Carter over and over again back in the '80s. I'm so pleased that Rogers' albums found their way to CD and can be enjoyed by future generations. His big sweet voice is unique as is the musicianship on this album. Listen to the riffs between the verses. One of the guitarists is Grit Laskin whose career is resurfacing and none to soon. This album should be in the nucleus of anyone's folk music collection along with Joan Baez's early recordings, the original Guthrie Folksay (not Folkways), early Josh White, Cisco Huston, and Logan English's interpretations of Guthrie. This one is deservedly a classic."
2,Really great for the classroom,I use this DVD in my Science classrooms to get students interested in volcanoes. It always grabs their attention and gets them thinking about what could happen. It is however quite long and some parts are a little over dramatic or showing technology we don't have yet. All in all though I would recommend this to high school Science teachers to help bring volcanoes to life.
2,"Genesis, a Woman's Perspective","My stars! Such a beautiful story. This is the story of Dinah. The daughter of Jacob mentioned in the Bible. There isn't much mentioned of Dinah in Genesis, but Diamant uses her brilliant talent and imagination to weave a story so heartwarming that you wish that it were actually in the Bible.This story is told in Dinah's voice. We get a look at how Dinah viewed her life as a child and young woman growing up in Canaanite society. I was connected to Dinah and the story of her mothers from page one. I was emotionally moved at practically every page. One page I was smiling or laughing. Another page, I was brought to tears.A magnificent book!"
2,100 times better than the first,This is the best movie since Monsturds no wait this movie is better than Monsturds even. You will not find a much better than this film. The first film wasn't even close to as good as this 5 stars way up for an excellent come back!!!
2,Mo Willems is a Genius!,"The pigeon series is wonderful! The books are funny, and engaging. PLUS they are short! So if you are really beat and don't have the energy for Dr. Seuss, read one of these and the kids will be happy and you can go to bed early!"
2,A Great Closing Album,"John's gift to the world of music under his RCA label came to a close with the release of this album- and sadly so. Here we find the seasoned songwriter and performer again on the top of his game. After releasing ""Dreamland Express"", an experimental album with a different feel than the ordinary Dever we all have come to love, John crafted ""One World"" to be among his finest. The album opens with ""Love is the Master"", an uplifting, upbeat, and most certain John Denver classic. As the album continues, we see the softer, honest John Denver in ""Love Again"", the open minded optimist in ""It's a Possibility"", the socially aware in ""Let Us Begin"" (watch out Mr. Dylan, John makes some brilliant moves with this strong dialogue between a world divided). This album showcases John's incredible scope as an artist, writer, and performer in the beauty, and grace you'd expect only from him. ""Flying for Me"" alone will give this album 5 stars... put it on your wish list you won't dissapointed!"
2,CLASSIC,A HUGE FAN OF JOHN COLTRANE AND ALL HIS WORKS. MY ONLY PET PEEVE IS THIS ALBUM ISN'T AS LENGHTY AS I WANTED IT TO BE.
2,Move over Angelina...,Gina Carano was fantastic and beautiful to watch in this movie. Enjoyed the real life feeling of the movie and the fighting style. No slow motion or recap of take downs. The story flowed well...only disappointed the movie wasn't about 30 minutes longer. I'll look for her in future movies. Really loved her style.
2,Great Book,I am a beginner to greenhouse gardens and I found this book easy to follow. He keeps things simple and yet goes into more complex issues that you could use if you wanted to. I would recommend if you are just starting out this is the book for you!!!
2,Just like The Beatles did them!,"I have been playing guitar and songs by The Beatles for many years. This is the FIRST book of chords that actually gets them all right. You will love this book. And, you will learn many really neat and possibly new chords. Very well done."
2,SG love,"I have personally enjoyed this book. As an aspiring photographer, i am very happy with the quality of the photos, and the type of content this book has to offer. SG fans can view the girls at their best. Missy Suicide did a wonderful job."
2,A great cleaning kit for handguns,This I believe is one of the best cleaning kits available the snap-n-pull system makes it a snap to change to different ends on the cleaning rod.
2,Beautiful Picture,"Really beautiful picture and pretty easy to set up. Lots of nice features. I bought a Monster Cable S-Video cable to go with it, and it makes a great difference. However, I can't get the volume control on my TV to respond, either using the controls on the TV or with the TV remote, during dvd playback. Any suggestions would be appreciated."
2,excellent,"yeah, it is obviously goodkind borrowed some ideas from jordan, but i haven no problem with that because goodkind makes them work better. 'sword of truth' series may not have such and endless stream of characters like 'wheel of time', but that's a good thing. goodkind makes you care for the characters in his books. you form a real emotional attachment towards them. jordan, on the other hand, has never been able to achieve that kind of emotional bond between the reader and the characters, partly because they're just too many. so, after read 'soul of the fire' i now certainly rank the 'sword of truth' series above 'wheel of time'."
2,Not your average pop rock,"I've purchased a lot of ""promising"" pop rock albums over the last 4 or 5 years and most of them have barely been worth the time it took to trade them in at the local used CD shop. This one is different. These guys are very good musicians, the lyrics are well above average, and the compositions rock in a good way, unlike some of the loud, talentless bands that seem to dominate the airwaves lately. I'd really like to give it 4 1/2 stars - it's not perfect but deserves more then 4."
2,EXCELLENT,This book is well worth the money. Short and sweet review and gets to the point now go buy this book!
2,Jerky Recipes,More than just Beef Recipes!!! This is so fullof great tasting jerky recipes. I am an avid meat eater and love to make jerky. It is addicting! I have made jerky for my six month old son who is teething and he loves it. Also great recipes that I use for camping and hiking.
2,Davey,"As with all of the Davey and Goliath stories, this volume is entertaining, while teaching lessons in honesty, courage and obedience, and seasoned with plenty of humor."
2,Britain's Best (and most underrated jazz pianist - WHY!!!),"this is sublime jazz by a pianist whose played with some of the world's best, yet goes uncelebrated in his own country, to their shame. If you don't believe me, listen to it, especially Philologie, which he wrote for Phil Woods. When did you last hear a British jazz pianist so inventive (he accompanies himself on electric piano)and so fast!"
2,A must read!!!,"I couldn't believe how wonderful this book was. A friend actually GAVE THEM TO ME. She didn't think they would be any good. Wonderful writing, adventure and romance. I only wish shea wrote more books"
2,Great game but a little easy.,"This game is really fun but with some songs i don't recognize. Anyway, it is still a good game but if you don't like a big challenge from guitar hero i don't think you would like this game because the expert mode is extremely well maybe not extremely but pretty easy. Well its a good game and i hope you enjoy."
2,This is a great work!,"This is the first really great Depeche album. It's probably also the biggest step forward taken in their career. Although some songs are better than others, there's not a dud on the album. It's also the first DM album to feature the exellent Alan Wilder. ""and Then.."" is a beautiful song and I really like, unlike most of these reviews, ""Pipeline"". I don't think it's boring at all."
2,Raff - A New Experience,"During the past year, I have heard pieces of Joachim RAFF, mostly played by Wally Faas on WQLN in Erie, PA. The music got my notice to the point I finally had to order this CD. Though not the best of RAFF (at least that I've heard), it's a welcome addition to my classical CD collection. I especially like ""In The Forest"". I would recommend this to anyone who loves classical music. - Charlene Morvay, Union City, PA"
2,Dawsons Creek Season 3,"To those OC lovers out there- you'll love Dawson's Creek even more. The OC is basically DC with easier language and more fashionable clothing! I have watched Dawson's since the first episode and I cried my eyes out when it ended. The cast of DC will become your friends after you've watched just a few episodes. You'll share their joys, laughter and heart ache- all before they're legal! You must own Season 3 in order to see what happens to Pacey and Joey... it will remind you that true love exists, not just in Nicholas Sparks books."
2,Worth reading,Received in good very good conditionPassed it along to a friend to readGave good ideas to think about
2,Terrible Things,"Terrible Things is based on the Holocaust and what happened during that time. Animals are used instead of people, and a forest instead of Europe. It talks about how terrible things came into the woods and took away animals by what they were or what they had for a tail or feathers. The animals talked to one another about their friends being taken away after it happened and not trying to prevent it from happening again. I think it teaches that there are times when you should get involved with business that doesn't include you and times when you shouldn't.I think the age level is maybe around 7-9 years. I think the book was interesting because it teaches history and is a story at the same time."
2,awesome pics,this are pics from her tour last year so you better get one because they are fantastic it is like the best ever! +++++++++++av rocks!
2,Pleasurable Era,"I enjoyed viewing the season. James Arness is excellent as well as the actor playing Chester who remarkably keeps up his wobbling in every conceivable stance or movement. But above all the attraction lies in the simplicity of ""moeurs"" of that pioneer Western culture."
2,"Not their best, but really good...","This is a really good album...I thought that I would dislike it, being a strong fan of 2112, Fly by Night, and A Farewell to Kings. I am glad to say that I was mistaken. It is not as good as the albums listed above, but it catches them in the middle of their synth period. This album is really catchy and has great singing. It shows how diverse Rush can be. Recomended to the moderate fan, but not a casual fan."
2,This book is well researched and easy to read,"I bought this book because I had been out of alpine climbing for 10 years and I wanted to get back into it. The authors are professional mountain guides but more than that, alpine climbing seems to be an integral part of who they are. I picked up a lot of very helpful information that covers everything from training, to equipment and boot selection, to alpine travel and avalanche knowledge. It is very suited to the Sierra Nevada range, where I do most of my climbing. This is the best book I have found on the subject."
2,so far; so good,Works fine so far. I've had it for about a month. Ate up the initial stack of paper easily but I fed it only 3 or 4 sheets each time and let it rest after 10 passes or so. Seems much more powerful than my old Staples brand shredder.
2,Fun read,"For a old graphic novel, this was actually a pretty entertaining read. It's a retelling of the Greek myths but with more naughty humor along with modern-day references. The artwork and colors are pretty good for their time, and the stories within are entertaining (three of them altogether) along with some exploration of philosophy and mythology for a decent price make for a solid buy. I especially liked the Hades and Persephone tale - it was funny to see the idea that they eloped together and made it look like a kidnapping. ;)"
2,terrific trays,I bought both the small and the large version of this and love them. They are good quality thick sturdy plastic with a nice sheen to them. I've used them all summer to ferry food and drinks to my patio and couldn't be more pleased.
2,worth reading,"for being the first novel by this author i thought is was very good. the first couple of chapter are very descriptive, but hang in there because i thought it was very good after that. i found it a very good read. i recommend it."
2,comical view from a small- town veterinarian,"I enjoyed reading Dr. Lucas' book about life in rural Iowa . The book touched on all the human emotions . I laughed many times throughout the book, yet I also found myself close to tears . Dr. Lucas portrays an honest , uncensored look at life as a veterinarian. A real eye-opener to the good , country life that many people are looking for."
2,Canadian life on the prairie,"It's hard to describe what this is about, except that the writing and acting hold one's attention, and we are drawn into the world of life in an extremely small town on the prairie as it might be in a pleasant dream, with people we really like, who amuse us with their everyday frustrations, intrigues, and kindnesses."
2,SanDisk 1 GB Ultra II Secure Digital Memory Card,"It's a very nice card. Very reliable, recomended. It's speed is OK but not as good as Extreme III. Never had problems with destroyed images. If you shoot in raw mode you 'll have to search for a SDHC (4GB or more)- I can shoot only 63 photos with my K10D."
2,DIGGIN' THIS TUNNEL OF LOVE,"She's out there somewhere, and she still thinks of you. Driving alone on a country road, or walking a rainy street downtown, she reflects on how things might have been different. Looking in the mirror, it occurs to her that she's known you half her life. If you encountered her by chance, you might say, casually, ""You can call me anytime, for this or that."" And then add, ""or you."" So often, what's most personal is universal. Wampeters are a band with vision and virtuosity, and Murder Your Darlings is an astonishing, guitar-driven exploration of the heart's ironies."
2,Sticks like it should,"When you use up your 3M kit tape because you foolishly bought a Frost King kit, you'll need to buy more 3M tape to finish the rest of your windows. It was so refreshing to use the tape that actually worked after struggling with the lousy tape that came in that other kit."
2,Great Video,"The video in my opinion is some what great except that mitchell plays the riffs a little too fast,but i manage. i hear some people say this video is only for advanced and experts not true. Ive been playing for a year in a half now and i got riffs 3-37 down without using the scribble book..but i did have to rewind ALOT because of the insanity...anyways..the video shows VH's style, technique, somewhat of a picture of what equipment he used, and his obsessness...if your an advanced or expert then i suggest it..if you just began playing dont even bother...novice, such as me, i highly recommend..the video helped me out alot on my skills and if you have trouble then try again...just like you do on video games until you get it down"
2,Beautiful Illustrations,"I was attracted to the book by the beautiful and inspiring art-work. I believe the art in itself communicates joy and peace. I am in synch with Louise Hay's perspective. I am in the nursing profession and do believe in medical science, however, I have witnessed first hand how anger specifically contributes to poor health patterns. We should all take care of ourselves mentally, spiritually, and physically."
2,Soaring rock vocals,"I first fell in love with Icehouse' music when I heard No Promises on the radio back in '85 or '86. I found the Measure for Measure album and then got to listen to earlier albums that were more alternative and less radio-friendly. But Man of Colors was a tour de force. It was what I wanted from Icehouse. First came the soaring love ballad, Crazy, then the follow-up Electric Blue, with its snazzy riffs, and finally I got the whole album on tape from an acquaintance in Australia. It was magic. Other songs I enjoy are Girl on the Moon and the epic story-song, Sunset and the Heartbreak Kid, which for me was a kind of sequel to the Eagles' New Kid in Town.This disc is kind of pricey but it's hard to find. I appreciate that they've got extras like extended versions of some songs, but I've heard most of these on other Icehouse albums."
2,Holdsworth's best solo,"I.O.U. is the best collection of vocal tunes on any Holdsworth record. Paul Williams is such great singer, I really wish that he had made more records with Allan and, in particular, I wish this band had stayed together longer. Williams also appears on ""Road Games"" and ""Metal Fatigue"", which are also good records, but I.O.U. is absolutely amazing...amazing in the all the same ways the debut record by UK is, this is progressive rock at its apex, and Holdsworth at his most lyrical..."
2,"Pleasant, charming read","A penniless and isolated small-time London actress suddenly finds that she has inherited a lovely old home on the coast of Devon, and insists on living there, despite its isolation and her lack of money to maintain it.She finds marvelous people and overcomes her shyness and unhappiness. The story is set entirely in England, with no Scottish characters or influence, which is unusual for the author, a Scotswoman. It still has herkeen sense of the beautify of the land and water. While a minor work, it is a great read."
2,Nice,It is a fun little lamp. Not very bright so it can only be used as decoration. Very light and can run on batteries for a long time.
2,Better than the pocket version,This guide is totaly more explicite that the pocket guide. It has more photos that the pocket. Bottom line two thumbs up.
2,solid mix of trance,"This relatively unknown compilation of trance music has the remarkable capability of providing a great collection of tracks that sound great on their own but also fit in wonderfully in this sweeping dj mix. Sure, the mix begins with some possibly annoying, cheesy epic/progressive trance, namely Xpander and Synaethesia, but the move into some more underground hard trance makes the album definitely worthwhile. The mixing is mostly seamless, but the mastering is what makes this mix great. The songs build off one another in rising action, climax, and cooling down. Tension and energy are steadily maintained through the course of the mix. Yet, the end doesn't necessarily come as a climax. Rather more of a pleasant release into chilldom with Beachball and Love Has Come Again (one of my all-time favorite trance tracks).Recommended tracks: #8 - Watching You; #9 - Awake; #11 - The First Rebirth"
2,Real Pool,"This game is interesting but not exciting. I love to play pool myself, but this game is......a little boring after a while. On the other hand, there are many games to play (nine ball, eight ball an TONS more) and the games are good. To position your shot is easy and making the actual shot is easy. BUT there are challenges. There are things called puzzles which are basiclly trick shots on different shaped tables ( star, heart ect.) Those are alot of fun and some are hard to master. This isn't the best game I've played but a good one still. I recommend renting it and trying it for yourself"
2,A laugh!,"Richie Rich is well loved by my 3 year old and myself. Is funny, well presented and full of fun and capers. I will be looking at buying movies similar to this one or any other family movies that are clean cut."
2,Ma$e i$ PHAT,"I like thi$ $ong becau$e It applie$ to me, i alway$ got tha' girl lookin' at me while my honie$ $tandin' there."
2,Great Heart rate Monitor Watch,This is a reallly nice watch - lightweight and attractive. The monitor result is quick. I also like the night light.
2,Nice!!,Love the new vinyl but I'm still waiting on my other one.. Where is it??But I digress.. I love my new vinyl!
2,"Does what it say on the tin, and well so far","Only had it for a little bit, but this thing rocks. It is precisely what I was looking for. (I am using it in a car stereo system with a sony multi voltage car adapter you can get elsewhere on amazon.)Also, the images make it look big -- it is not. it's TINY. Imagine rolling your hand into a fist and gripping a small screw driver handle. It's about the size of that handle. Tiny.The range is pretty puny too, as other reviews have stated. However, I've never ever met a bluetooth device that really goes beyond 20 feet anyway, and that's not the point of that tech anyway, so I'm quite happy with it."
2,This game is fun for all ages.,"This game is based on the 1989 seguel to the movie Ghostbusters. I have played this many times and find it very fun. For any GB fan, I suggest you try it. And even if you are not a GB fan you will enjoy it."
2,excellent large not stick pan,Really have enjoyed cooking with this pan. I hate long handles and this pan is perfect. Made chicken parmesian and the heat conduction on the bottom of the pan was uniform. Excellent for starting a dish and finishing in the oven
2,Works great,This was purchased for my mother-in-law and she loves it. Keeps her tea and hot coco warm for her as she sits in her recliner and reads or watches TV.
2,Great player but drains batteries,"This is a really good MP3 player & USB storage device. I bought the previous version and this one with the LCD display is so much more useful.The only problem is that it constantly drains the battery (a problem with the previous version also) even when the player is off. So if you don't use it for a while and leave the battery in it, you will find that the battery has less ""juice"" or is completely drained (for you geeks: it draws 700uA to 800uA in the""off"" state). I would guess that it's because Creative is using an electronic ""power"" switch instead of a mechanical one....poor choice. Just remember to take the battery out when not in use!"
2,Homestead,"I love this book: Homestead, I have read and reread it, have it in my home and on my Kindle. I plan on re-reading it many more times. It is so real, makes you feel like you were on the Homestead w/them. I have read other books by this author, they were not as real to me as this book. I love Jane Kirkpatrick."
2,It Certainly Does,"We Norah Jones fans can all breathe a sigh of relief -- Jones is back and ""Feels Like Homes"" certainly does. Although not as completely successful as ""Come Away With Me"" -- there are two or three tracks I'm not crazy about -- there are some absolutely gorgeous songs that rival, if not surpass, those on that album. And, once again, Jones' voice is a marvel, smokey and smooth at the same time. The arrangements are fantastic, and who'd have thunk that Dolly Parton, of all people, could blend so marvelously with Ms. Jones. All in all, I'm so happy with ""Feels Like Home,"" happy for us fans, and happy that Ms. Jones didn't hit a sophmore slump. Brava!"
2,Perfect pop.,"I know it's not a nice thing these days to say that an album is ""perfect pop"", but this is truly one of those albums that after a few listens will draw you in. I never heard any of Terry Hall's previous work before hearing the ""Forever J"" single when looking for Ian Broudie productions, and I was pleasantly surprised. Surprised enough that I picked up the album and was stunned by it's sheer beauty.I can't say enough about it. Terry's voice, layered over top of jangling guitars and swirling synths... heaven.If you like the Lightning Seeds, you will love this."
2,This is my favorite produce wash.,"This stuff is hard to find in stores. I bought other brands trying to replace the Biokleen, but finally just bought a case to keep on hand. This stuff gets produce cleaner than the already-diluted sprays."
2,"Comfortable, doesn't slip and fashionable!","I'm a swim official and around the pool a lot. I searched high and low for a fashionable non slip shoe that had to be in white. SO glad I found these. They are super comfortable and truly non-slipping! These style skechers can be a bit narrow so I ordered a Wide size 8 (I have normal feet, not wide) and it was perfect! I ordered the regular ones and they were so narrow in width, the length was true to size. The wide shoes were perfect and did not LOOK wide when wearing them. Great price for a good quality shoe."
2,Love It!,"I knew I'd only be using it for short range and haven't had it hooked up long range very much.. Short range however it is great. It's basically a sound card as well so if you don't have one this may be all you need.. My laptops sound card is crummy, I bought a Creative sound blaster pcmcia optical sound card and this is way better than even the optical. And it works great with Itunes.. my only complaint is the remote control doesn't work all that well for skipping songs but that may just be a weak battery. Keep up the good work Logitech!"
2,I Am Stuck like Band-aid,"Definitely a how-to book with back-up research. I borrowed this from my local library, and now I'm buying my own copy. I will definitely be using it over and over and over. First, I thought that the SUCCESs tips were self-explanatory. Reading this gave me a new view of what's Simple, Unexpected, Concrete, Credible, Emotional and Stories. I have to say my favorite chapter is the first one (Simple). Who knew simple can be much simpler?!"
2,A Novel of Emotional Truth,"Elizabeth Berg has spun a tale so compelling and full of emotion. What We Keep is the story of mothers and daughters, distant yet close. Berg examines the mother-daughter relationship and it impacts every faucet of life.Berg dedicates the novel to women who risk telling the truth. This is a very strong statement that one can only fully contemplate as they finish What We Keep.We meet Ginny as she is flying to meet her mother that she has not seen for 35 years. As we travel with Ginny the reader gets to day dream with her as she recollects her time with her mother and the impact that her leaving has had on her life. The novel is narrated by both present day Ginny and Ginny at 12 years old as she relives the summer that changed her life.A great literary talent, Berg is an author that does not disappoint. What We Keep is a compelling novel that will have you anxiously turning the pages."
2,Good light,"The only thing that I thought was a little off from what I was expecting in this light is that it's a bit heavier than I thought it was going to be... Not for backpacking, but great for in your car."
2,Touching,"Wonderful movie which explores piecing a family back together after heartbreak and tragedy. Love, love, love George Clooney's portrayal of a dad!"
2,Amazing!!,"I was dying to see this movie since it came out on the theathers but never got the chance to go. So I decided to rent itit and I loved it . They did a good reboot of the classic movie. Would recommend it to anybody who likes a little bit of action,comedy,and sci-fi"
2,A Bible Version that is easy to read,"This version of the Bible was written in simple language so that it could be easily communicated in sign language to the hard of hearing. It is a good companion to the New King James version or the NIV. Passages can be read with a good understanding of what is being said. Some readers adhere to the scholarly approach of the King James version , but this has always been difficult to read for me. The ""joy of spending time in God's word"" is a little more joyful with easier to read translations."
2,The Good Stuff,"Very good candy bars and not expired. Creamy caramel, rich chocolate... I will be buying these again but only during the cooler parts of the year."
2,Best of Flynn and great villians!,This is positively the definitive version of Robin Hood and I hope someone has the good sense to produce a quality DVD in the very near future.
2,Hayek is a hero!,"I found this book in Amazon, read the reviews and bought it. At the end, I was very embarassed by the fact that I had a Master degree and yet I lacked the knowledge that this work existed. I had heard of Hayek, but this book alone, with the most wonderful words on freedom and common sense, turned me into a very big Hayek fan. Buy your copy and read it right now, for if you do it later you will regreat."
2,Go strider!,love this book and I am a big fan of striderIs the 2 best character of the book.I Lauren love this book.
2,Wife loves it,"This sewing machine was for my wife, she loves it. Says it sews so nicely and has different speed settings which she needs because she tends to be lead footed."
2,Small Short Review Of One Piece,"This is my first review of one piece I saw the 4 kids version that one suck lol xDcomparing to this re-dub,uncut it's amazing I only saw few episodes airing on toonami when I was younger I take a look back at it now One piece is really great.I regret missing some of the episodes the lesson is don't judge a book for it cover & some how I find this collection to be funny-eh I enjoy product!Now my rating 8.7 or 8.9"
2,Enthralling,"I LOVED this book! Ms. Staples vivid descriptions of the seemingly magical Pakistani life-despite it's opressiveness to women-will linger in my daydreams for a long time to come. I'm holding my breath for a sequel! (come on, I must know!)"
2,More relevant than ever in 2010,"I have the 1955 edition of this book and it is on a small list of books that I read at least every 2 years. I live along the Maine Coast and I am an avid aquarium keeper. I began reading this time about a week before the big BP oil disaster in The Gulf Of Mexico and I wish that every person everywhere could read this book today. Some of the science is obviously a bit out of date - we've learned a lot in the past half century, but the beauty of Rachel's writings continues to thrill. When I see the images of oil drenched sea birds on TV, my heart also breaks for the hundreds of species whose micro world is known only to those who have taken the time to explore the magical mysteries that lie at the edge of the sea."
2,Best for a long stay in Hawaii,We used this book all the while we were in the islands. On Kauai it helped us find some neat small places we would have missed. On Maui we found the Hana road's most interesting spots. On the Big Island we found a wonderful Orchid farm that we would never have seen. I think this is a terrific book.
2,Good book,"This is a great book for introducing the novice to robot making. Even for me, a EE graduate, the introduction of basic electronic components was a nice refresher."
2,Quality filtered water for pennies a day,"I have been using Crystal Quest water filters for about 10 years now. You can't beat the price with ANY other water filter or replacement cartridge on the market. There's no need to replace this filter every month or so as it will last well over a year. Granted, we are only a 2-person household, but thanks to these filters, we drink a LOT of healthy, pure, great-tasting water for only pennies a day. When we travel, we take our own bottles of water with us as you never know how the water is going to be, especially in motels. I use this filtered water for cooking, making beverages, for my pets, the birdbath, watering houseplants, etc. Try these filters; you won't be disappointed!"
2,"Good Quality, Ok Price","I purchased the Graco Pack 'N Play with the Bassinet and found it to be exactly what was described. I like the neutral colors and the ease of transport. The padding was actually pretty substantial- more than I expected. I did, however, think that the bassinet's quality did not merit a $13 increase in price from the Pack 'N Play that does not include it. But overall, I am very pleased and would recommend the product. Amazon redeemed themselves this time and shipping was very fast."
2,I love these!,"I have been looking for new automatic switches for my outside house lights for some time. Prior to this, I was using Radio Shack switches with a remote time controller. I had to reset these every month or so during the season as sunset time changed. The old switches quit working and before replacing one for the third time I looked into something new. I was just looking for a decora sized switch to match the rest of my house switches and was delighted with the idea of the switch adjusting ""on"" and ""off"" times on it's own, based on sunrise and sunset at my home location. These switches are simple to install and take only a few minutes to program. Now I don't need to reset them monthly or after a power failure. I need only to adjust twice a year for daylight savings time. And they are easy to override if I want the lights on manual mode. A great product."
2,Great gym bottle,"This is my 3rd camelbak, and it's a really nice one. Holds a lot of water, and the handle is nice for picking up during a workout. You can easily drink with one hand, which is another plus. I've had my first one for about 2 years and it's held up well, even through some drops. The only negative is that is does leak if you turn it upside-down, so be careful in your gym bag or purse!"
2,A must for any Beatles fan,"This is a must. So in depth. Great back stories. Great interviews that have never been seen. You think you know everhything,but you dont!"
2,Couldn't make it through this last month without this pillow!,"I thought I could make it through my first pregnancy by piling pillows all around me in the bed, but my sleep and my back began to suffer. I caved and purchased this pregnancy pillow and could kick myself for not buying it sooner. My middle back has been aching, instead of my lower back (as it is for most pregnant women), but this pillow provides just the right amount of support so that I can make it through the day without aching. Every night I've had the pillow I have only woken up once or some nights not at all! I am looking forward to using this pillow for tummy support after my C-section, as well."
2,Awesome and Intense,"I saw this movie on video a year or two after it was released back in the late eighties. It's an excellent film on several levels. The plot is incredibly intense and will definitely hold your attention. The central character, played by James Woods, is complex, enigmatic, and incredibly driven. While the movie exposes the horrific crimes against humanity that were committed by a U.S.-backed regime, it retains it's narrative integrity and never strays over the line into a heavy-handed mouthpiece of ideology. I highly recommend this movie, but be warned that it does contain scenes of graphic violence."
2,amazing cd!,"this is an amazing cd. i'd recomend it to anyone! andrew mcmahon has an amazing voice, and his music is very compelling. i cant say enough how much i've enjoyed this cd!"
2,Whore,First time buying in Amazon and for being a used book it is in an excellent condition. It looks like I purchase in a regular Bookstore brand new..
2,This book is a great help,"Steve Herzog did it the hard way. But you can benefit from his journey with this book. I'm a ""young"" wedding photographer. Although I've been a photographer for almost 30 years, the wedding biz has its own peculiarities. Mr. Herzog's insights, advice, and experience are worth the asking price of this book.One problem is that the book is getting long in the tooth: the prices shown are quite old. This can be sort of jarring and disorienting. Steve, you should update all the numbers!Bottom line: while the pricing structures are terribly outdated, the advice is timeless and very up-to-date.If you're buying this book, you MUST also purchase his ""Contracts, Policies, and Procedures."" Together, these will save you hours of aggravation, embarrassment, and general cluelessness.My name is David D. Schultz, and I approve this review (I wrote it!)"
2,Very good,Very well written and organized however some confusion once in a while withthe illustrations being mis or non labeled.The magic x should have been defined earlier in the text.Limited look at building anchors.Minor items - loved reading it.
2,Two classics!!,If you are new to John Waters get this.. It's his old school work and its best to start out with his wildest work ever.
2,All around GREAT camera,"Quick facts about this camera: It's light, battery life lasts roughly 3 hours of straight use, and the 4MB Memory Stick supplied is decent. The user interface is so simple I NEVER had to get the instructions. There are so many personal tweaks you can adjust to the camera (white balance, black and white mode, timed exposures, 10 second timer, great zoom lens, macro mode... the list goes on!). The movable LCD screen is crisp and is very convenient to use. The camera feels solid and well-built.I personally bought a 32MB Memory Stick to gain more picture storage- this camera can now take 80-90 pictures at 1024x768 resolution. Also bought the Floppy Disk Adapter... but stick with the USB if you already have it on your computer.Also, one side note- this camera will be able to link to your Sony Playstation2 video game console in the future!"
2,Best value for your money,"I've had mine for just about 2 years and it works superbly. I'm a landscaper and only use electric tools,...I needed a mower for the clients who still have lawns. This one cuts so neatly that you will like it a lot. Now granted, with electric you give up brute power, as compared to gas, but you can work around that by adjusting the height up for tall grass, then cutting twice. Also, these do work best without a catcher mounted on the side. Looks nice, light weight, smooth running. Thanks a million to the number of folks who took the time to review this mower, as it encouraged me to buy one. I think I've finally become smooth with the extension cord dance too. LOL."
2,Perfect fit and function,The adapters do exactly what they are supposed to and are easy to install and use. I have used cheaper plugs in the past which do not have the firm but not overly tight fit. I use these on my Panasonic Display and have had no issues in the last 4 years. They do not appear to have worn either in spite of at least 100 installs and re-installs for various product tests.
2,It is a novel but a beautiful novel and explicitly spiritual in it's aims and goals.,"Now, I didn't see the movie but from what I have heard Scorcese missed the boat as to what this novel was all about. (Just for the record, I think Scorcese is over rated!!)This was a beautiful book. It is not blasphemous in any way shape or form. If one reads it to the end you will understand what I mean.Are there are few uncomfortable moments? Yes! But that is the point of the book. The title of the book explains everything and is ITSELF explained on the last page.If you are a Christian don't be afraid of this book or what others might say about the film. Go to a bookstore and check out the author's forward, and you just might find yourself buying the book."
2,Dazzling,"A wonderful soundtrack the movie is great i especially love jennifer hudson's voice good songs like one night only,move,fake your way to the top, and caddilac car"
2,Best single so far!!!,"""In the End"" is my favorite song from the Hybrid Theory album. I've listened to this album over and over again, yet I never get bored. Especially not with this song. It's a very nice song, I find the meaning behind the lyrics is very true... it's just awesome... its like they're sayin that as hard as we try in life, everything wont matter in the end when we leave this world... that is if we look partly on the chorus. Overall, this song is pretty much about break up. Besides the lyrics, the music is also awesome!! It starts with piano tune then in the middle it's like the ""climax"" of the song... and it ends with piano tune... not to mention the video clip, it has really cool settings and stuff!! I just LOVE this song!! Rock on Linkin Park!!!"
2,Nice,"I bought ""The thin red line"" soundtrack thinking the chants from the film would be on it.Only after I found this c.d by mistake did i realise the best chants in the film are here.If you liked the chants in the movie ,go for it."
2,Eye Opener!,This subject I didn't really want to spend too much more time on but do want to be informed. I'm glad I took the time to watch. Dinesh did his homework! It truly is an eye opener! It may seem dark to some but such is the subject matter. Very informative.
2,Great music and worth the cover photo alone!,"Even if good, sensual, jazzy music isn't your style, this CD is worth buying just to gaze upon the beautiful Imani!! Who is the lucky man she's singing ""I Belong to You"" to? If the slot is vacant I'd like to apply. If given the chance, I know we could have a ""Laissez Faire Love Affair,"" and even share some ""Real Love."" Seriously, this is a good cd. The lyrics, melodies, and arrangements are relaxing, inspiring, and delightful to listen to. Sade better get back to work. Her replacement is in the building."
2,Not Quite Goldeneye,"This has got to have been one of the most eagerly awaited games of all time, and i have to say that its pretty good. Although its not visualy as good as Goldeneye there are are a lot of factors that make this game better. There are loads of new levels various new weapons, and a whole new story. Everyone who was a fan of Goldeneye must own this game or they will miss out on all of the fun that they had with Goldeneye."
2,picture dictionery,The book is for use by a stroke patient and has been an excellent tool to assist in speech therapy using alternate means to communicate
2,2001. Results. The best love story.,"I liked Romeo + Juliet and hoped that next Lurmann's picture wouldn't be worse. And it wasn't.It's very original musical and there are a lot of things about this side of the film, but...This is a story of love. Young poet and courtesan. Their life. Their fate. Their love. Above everything - there is only one thing. And it is love. The main thing in the world. And it is beautiful and light feeling even if it is a tragical love. Romeo + Juliet was about it. Moulin Rouge! was about it. And it is so great that in our pragmatic and cynical world there are people who understand, thatALL WE NEED IS LOVE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,good book,this book delivers a range of jigs and tips to increase your efficiency. this is a good thing and i intend to use the suggestions.
2,I heart chess....,"This is a great DVD for any fans of the musical or the stars who are involved with the project. Wish there were more special features (just has a trailer of the show), but it is nice to get to watch the show performed! If you bought the CD (which I highly recommend as well, the 2-disc version ROCKS!) this video will make the plot MUCH more clear if you haven't seen the show before. Believe it or not, the 2 disc CD does leave out some of the audio, and a bit of conversation as well. Some things you just have to see for yourself..."
2,the best,"Sam Raimi made this super low budget horror,cult, film.It stars Bruce Cambell in his debut.It is very gory and stands up to its R rating but its a extremly scary welldone midnight horror flick"
2,A great mat for an affordable price,"I bought this mat when I wanted to start P90X and I am 100% satisfied with my purchase. From the reviews, I noticed that some people had some issues with the bad smell coming out of the mat but I did not have such problem. I can say the mat is almost odorless. I was about to be lured into buying a mat with similar specifications which would cost me around 90 bucks but I am so happy I came across this one and I ended up buying it. By the way, the ultra thickness does make a big difference. All in all, it is a great mat with a very affordable price!"
2,A Porgy & Bess to Match Miles and Evans,"This is, unfotunately, a little known recording as it came out in Paris during the period of The Great Exchange between the American and French jazz musicians and was never released here in the States.Eddy Louiss is a great jazz organist who would be ranked at the top had he been playing here in the 1950s and 1960s.This is a session in the Gil Evans - Miles Davis mode of Sketches In Spain and, yes, Porgy and Bess.To my mind this session ranks fully with Gil and Miles' version.But take a sample listen for yourself. I think many of you will be satisfied enough to buy.It's a solid entry from France into the canon of jazz verisons of American musical stage shows."
2,Best Garlic Press I've Ever Used,"Everyone knows that it's pretty hard to find a good Garlic Press. In fact, until now I've been happy to use no garlic press whatsoever; rather mincing garlic with a cook's knife. Then I came across the Cutco Garlic press as a part of the Cutco Pizza pack, and to my suprise it was easy to use, could hold more garlic than most presses, and most important of all: INCREDIBLY EASY TO CLEAN. No more chopping for me, from now on I happily use the Cutco garlic press; it's the only garlic press I use or recommend."
2,a classic,"well how do you review a classic? and be as honest as you desire to be. so many words have already been spent on reviewing this book. still, an attempt i do make.insightful engaging and relevant. and will continue to be for as long as we survive as a race. a human story. a common story. for the simple reason that one sees oneself in atleast one of the characters.anna and levin two extreames,formed from the same personality. the condemned anna and the righteous levin.shocking was the condemnation of anna by the author in his abrupt dissappearace of her after her death. and also missed the anna that is reflected in her introductory pages, as she comes to resolve her brothers family issues.the beauty and strength reflected therin came to an abrupt end.i felt i was reading a story of two annas.still a un putdownable. and utterly beautiful."
2,Impressive Output,"I don't own this printer - but a friend does. This printer is way way better than similarly priced epsons and HP's. Using the right media and settings, the photos printed on gizmo will blow you way.However, I decided not to purchase this printer when I found that costco will print 4X6's and 8X12's (off digital media) for rather low prices in their one hr photo lab. I can always do the cropping/balancing at home, take the CD-R to them - and get a huge numbers of prints - just for the cost of owning this printer. And I am not even factoring the cost of media and ink in the equation!"
2,This is Not Perry's,The book starts out with some refinery flow sheets for making 'grasoline' from 'californing' crude. Process control is simple enough. The next section on fluid flow uses non-standard equations which are overly complex. The same goes for heat transfer. Fair does a good job on distillation. Reaction engineering is completly omited from this text.
2,Just what I expected,Being a Witchblade fan have bought the DVD to complete my collection. OK so you can never reproduce the graphics in the zines but its a good story line and consistent with the original. Well worth the price.
2,:-),loved it. It came in good condition and in good time. Have most of the Jesse Stone movies. I deal with alcoholics and I think his situation is interesting.
2,Interesting adaptation,"I love this movie. I teach mythology to high schoolers and, after reading Beowulf, we discuss the way the original Epic has been adapted. I have my students compare the way the magical elements have been brought into the realm of possibility and this serves to help explain how myths often develop from real events. This, I believe, fits with Crichton's original intention, as stated in the afterword to Eaters of the Dead, which was to prove that the story of Beowulf is exciting. Besides, the music is fantastic and I never have any trouble watching Antonio."
2,Great Filming,My husband and I just finished watching The Pacific and we enjoyed it so much. The filming was so realistic. It really made you appreciate what the World War II soldiers had to contend with while fighting in the Pacifice campaign. The acting was superb! Great stories.
2,stomachache relief,"This product is fantastic for all of the listed attributes, but I use it primarily to soothe an irritated stomach. Anytime someone in our family has stomach problems, we pass around the Arm & Hammer gum, and viola!, they feel better almost immediately. I would recommend this product to everyone."
2,Singing Judith Levine praises!,"Literally, I'm not even half way through the book, though plan on curling up and finishing it tonight! I actually went to the author, Judith Levine's website to write her a persona e-mail and let her know how much I'm enjoying the diary of her and her partner's year-long experiment, and the honesty in her writing style. You feel as if you know her personally just a couple of chapters in. Being a New Yorker myself, and dealing with the daily exposure to so much culture, food, music, fashion and film, the reason most of have chosen to live in this place... I understand how hard it would be to take most all of that away for a year, and not feel terribly lost without it. I recommend to anyone in financial dilemma, or just looking for a new awareness into this consumerist America that we live in. Pick it up!"
2,still won't drink....,"really cool product, but my 17 year old cat still won't drink from from it.... prefers the drip of the bathtub. Maybe the next kitty...great product, great shipping. Hassle FREE."
2,Jeannie C. Riley's Harper Valley P.T.A. album,"I'm glad that someone decided to release the Harper Valley P.T.A. album entirely instead of just selected best songs. Getting the best of songs is probably what a person should do first. For this album doesn't include such classics as The Rib and The Generation Gap, but once a person already gets introduced to her this is definitely a must. While the best of albums try to include mostly ordinary songs of her and some story ones, this album is classic for all of the songs, except Shed me no Tears, are story ones which is what Jeannie C. Riley was best at. The album includes some tunes from the songwriter Tom T. Hall. (It's admirable that Riley stuck with the same songwriters throughout her short career.) So there are other memorable catchy songs on this cd like Sippin' Shirley Thompson, Mr. Harper and The Little Town Square."
2,Good book on Dinosaur building,"It's very in depth. The author seems to know quite a bit about real dinosaurs, I find that helpful. There is plenty of modeling tips and ideas on various kinds of kits, from vinyl to plastic injected models.It is a bummer that most of the pictures are in black and white. Though the few color pictures are very well done. I especially like the paint work the author did on the models themselves. Bright colors and patterns, very nature like. No one really knows what color a dinosaur would be, but the models are realistic looking.The author also has information on creating backgrounds and displays to go with your model dinosaur, I find that a plus in favor of this book."
2,great,these were great quick service sorry no response from me I did not know this was here I am sorry but the service and product is great
2,Rihanna: A girl like me review,"Highly enjoyable, like the rest of Rihanna's albums.As always, her album and style change with each album, which I like."
2,Review,"Good Quality, but better to watch them one at a time prior to a movie than to just sit down and watch the entire dvd"
2,One of the best shows ever,"If you like Hogan's Heroes, then there's not much I need to add to the review. Season three is as good as any. Don't hesitate to buy season 3."
2,Thanks,"Due to a fire, I lost this CD (but the booklet somehow survived). I didn't think that I could find it again. Through your site not only did I find it, but several other vendors had it as well. The CD that I purchased must be an import, and the booklet is different from the one that I had before. The CD that I got is from a different label than the RCA label. There are color pictures of them and a story behind this historical recording. It's also interesting that the CD says ""George"" Ruffin and not ""David"". I'll keep it for that reason alone. Thanks."
2,Great!,"This has saved my sanity when flying and laying over in airports with no place to plug in and pump. Awesome! Plus, it actually works better than the normal plug because it's a higher voltage."
2,Halfway to the toilet,"Upon listening to this CD, you'll be Halfway to... disgust. You'll probably be dissapointed that this CD is so different than his other stuff. But,keep listening you'll then find that it's an enjoyable CD, and worthy to own if you're looking for something a little different in the tecnho genre."
2,Scary but True,"I have been to Gettysburg 7 times. When I first went as a 8 year old I didn't believe in ghosts but after taking their ""Candelight ghost walks"" I instantly became obsessed with ghosts. When I say this I speak of all 6 or so books, they each contain easy to read, but powerful stories that sometimes keep you up at night. (Especially when you read the books at Gettysburg!)Mark Nesbitt grew up in Lorain, Ohio so my mom knows him and he knows a lot about ghosts."
2,Perfect Solution,"I recently came into possession of my dad's 35mm slides. Most were in envelopes, some were loose, wrapped in rubber bands. I search around for a decent storage method to store the slides after I scanned them (Canon CanoScan 900F). I found this Storage box, and love it! I may have to order another one if dad finds more slides, this one's about full. I like that it's not a cheap, flimsy container. It will fit in the Safe Deposit Box if I decide that's where it will be long-term. I use the dividers to seperate the slides by topic & decade, but wish there was an option for plastic dividers, rather than cardboard, although they are still pretty sturdy cardboard."
2,Excellent book with some disturbing features.,"This is an extremely good story that manages to balance an extremely diverse range of characters and situations. However, when every other race in the book and group seems to have it's heroes, the only Asian that is even mentioned as a distinct character is a homicidal torturer? Balancing everyone's special interest is difficult in a book but I hope Mr. Stirling puts in a good word for some ""good"" Asians out there. Other than that though I must compliment Mr. Stirling on his attention to details and for writing such an interesting and thought provoking book. This will definitely be one I will read again and again."
