1,Universal cry (Nasio Fontaine),"I have not recieve this item purchased on 11/24/07,and it remain the only item not recieved,otherwise, all other items had been recieved and in good condition."
1,rehash,total rehash of other ideas from thinkers some good some no so good not worth buying I would definitely not recommend this book
1,HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE!,"This printer has been a huge disappointment from the moment I got it. Luckily I got it for free as a bundle with a digital camera. First, takes a LONG time to actually begin to print a document, even with just normal text. Second, it easily gets clogged print head nozzles, and you use lots of ink cleaning them. There is no other option, however. It also says you are out of black ink, and won't print when you have just replaced the black ink, brand new cartridge. You end up thinking you got a bad cartridge, and replacing it again, only to find still same problem printing. Clean print head nozzles again, still no success. So...junk, junk, junk! Very expensive to keep trying to fix it. After having these problems, I read other user reviews. Evidently this is a universal problem, not just with mine. Mine lasted only 1 year, as did others who bought same printer. Do not buy this product!"
1,Not a likeable character in the bunch...,"I'm sorry, but I hated this book. I'm apologizing because I really seem to be in the minority there. I heard so many great things, but how can you like a book if you don't like ANY of the characters. I thought they were all pretty dispicable. I don't really care if it was 1964 or not. The only redeeming quality is that it would make great fodder for a book club discussion if that's what you were looking for."
1,Not so frightful October,"Perhaps the very young will find the stories in this book frightening, but frankly I'd feel quite safe reading it to 6 year olds. Not sure it would long entertain even the very young. The stories are very predictable. They lack atmosphere as well."
1,poor quality,"chain tarnished quickly. did not clean up well. i think it is china cheap plated not real .925 so, they deceived me"
1,Pass,"I'm open minded when it comes to the natural selection versus religion debate. Unfortunately, however, this film did not present both sides of the argument. I think it is important to weigh both pros and cons of any debate to be truly educated about your beliefs but this film was not able to do that. I was hoping for something more intuitive."
1,Does not deliver,"This book is a ... , trust me when I tell you that you will learn very little out of it , it has lots of pretty samples but it is not enough to teach , there are no tutorials , no step by step and hardly any informative text . For example the coloring section shows the inks and then the finished colors next to it - that's it .You can learn just the same by looking at comics , I was very disappointed from this book . ..."
1,Ultralight Spin Fishing - A Practical Guide,"After reading the few reviews I thought this book was a must-read. I was so wrong. It was a complete waste of time. It might (and that's an iffy might) be good for the rank novice who's just getting into fishing. For anyone with any experience at all, and especially someone with years of ultralight experience, this book is a complete waste. You'll get a lot more for your money spent if you spend it on on lures."
1,"Bring back Return of the Living Dead, this sequal su**s",I think Return of the Living Dead was so much better than this one. I think it would be great if you brought it back!
1,Readible but wrong,We purchased this book thinking it might be useful for our medical students. It is not. This book has numerous basic errors of pharmacology principles. It is laid out well and communicates things clearly however it is misleading and wrong about important aspects of pharmacology. Believing some of what is written in this book could result in harm if it influenced prescribing decisions.A book written in this style covering these areas could be very useful if it was correct.Dr Matt DoogueClinical Pharmacology Registrar.
1,good cause BAD book,"It is difficult to understand that readers gave this book such glowing reviews. I had not read 4 pages before I wondered if it was written by and for a junior high student. After that I radidly scanned the rest of it, hoping to discover something to capture my interest sufficiently to warrant further reading. No such luck. The relationship between the protagonists is so juvenile and unrealistic that it made me despair of the intelligence of anyone who could identify with it. The only redeeming feature of this author's attempt at a literary production was that some of the profits are to go to a worthy cause."
1,A disappointing novel from Jim Webb,"I've always been a big fan of Jim Webb's fiction, so this book was a disappointment to me. While Mr. Webb continues to excel at descriptive prose in his vivid depictions of Viet Nam cyclo drivers and Bangkok pig markets, the plot in this novel was too unbelievable to give this book any staying power as a piece of literature. Mr. Webb did not take the time to make his characters' connections seem authentic, and the climactic moment in the book is forced and utterly improbable. In the end, this is a cheap paperback thriller that shouldn't be taken too seriously . . . and don't buy the hardcover!"
1,Was not pleased.,"I gave two stars just because the product arrived. However, the dvd case was cracked and the dvd was moving freeling inside collecting scratches. Willing to forgive the cracked case, I put it in the dvd player discovering that the quality of the dvd is that of vhs and was supremely disatisfied. The entire product looked like it was created on a home computer and was not worth my 19.99 plus shipping. Will not order again."
1,Another disappointed fan...,"I have been anxiously awaiting this series to be out, and the little DVD that has been produced is a TOTAL disapppointment! To allow only 2 songs to MIG AYESA-the best performer by far-is an utter travesty! I won't be buying..."
1,Not up to American Diabetes Association standards,"As a diabetes educator I was very excited to learn that the ADA was producing a video just for men about diabetes. When I first viewed it, I thought maybe I just didn't get the overdone slapstick humor so I had others at my institution review it. The general consensus is that the video is disjointed, in poor taste, and poorly filmed. And although it attempts to highlight the complications of poor control, it does very little to teach how to achieve good control. This is not a video that we will recommend!"
1,Boring and Dull...Just like Real Life,"This is a science fiction novel which has explores the human predicament through multiple third person views. Members of the Society of Friends (Quakers) have left earth in a self-sustaining vessel to colonize a new planet. The story explores the relationship of the Friends' method of governance by consensus, fear of change and family. The subject matter was more mundane than is normal for a 'hard' science fiction novel and the change of persective brought interesting insight into how humans live. All-in-all I found it somewhat dull and neither the story-line nor the characters gripped me."
1,Disappointing at best,Amazon did a great job of getting the DVD to my door on the date promised. Excited I couldn't wait to watch these videos however after repeated delays in working properly in my XBOX I finally got the 1st and 2nd DVDs to work. I was not so lucky with the 3rd DVD. I cannot get it to play at all. I even tried another DVD player in case it was my XBOX player.Now I am waiting to call Amazon to see what can be done.
1,Poor quality,Great when it was working well. Unfotunately it quit working after 6 months. This product created a lot more hassle for me than it ever saved me.
1,AL SHARPTON FOR PRESIDENT,"This game is terriable. I cant believe people gave this game a good rating. Realistic? You cant even kill your own allies. Thats realistic? You people know nothing about video games. The game is linear and it seems that the allies would have lost the war without you, you end up doing everthing. The history lesson after each mission was boring and should have never been put in the game. The symphony music sounded like you were at a funeral. This game is not as good as everyone claims it is."
1,I used the cups several times for short ...,"I used the cups several times for short amounts of time. The fit was semi-correct and as far as comfort, I couldn't tell I was wearing it at all. Even though I wore the cup for only a short period of time there was some slight leaking. I recommend it if you're looking to be """"intimate"""" during a time you usually may not want to. I don't recommend it for long term feminine protection."
1,I am a mormon,"I am saddened to see such contempt and disgust for a religion that has brought light and meaning to my life. I do not think I am better than anyone else because I am a Mormon, and I hope that you realize that a bad experience or two by Mormon families does not classify all the people of the church. The church is perfect: the people are not. All I can do is tell you that I have found the LDS church to be true for myself and it brings me happiness every day. I am grateful to my Savior Jesus Christ for all that I am and all that I have. I am an honest, educated person who respects all persons regardless of religion. So please do not condemn what you do not understand."
1,MUSIC TOO LOUD,"I ORDERED THIS MOVIE BECAUSE I REMEMBER IT AS ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES ABOUT THE LIFE OF CHRIST. THE RECREATION OF THIS MOVIE ON DVD IS HORRENDOUS. THE PICTURE IS GRAINY AND THE MUSIC SO LOUD AS TO MAKE IT VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO HEAR THE DIALOGUE. THIS WAS A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY AND A MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT. THIS IS A WIDE SCREEN VERSION OF THE MOVIE AND IT FILLS UP ONLY THE CENTER ONE THIRD OF THE SCREEN MAKING IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE. THERE WERE SO MANY DARKLY LIT SCENES I COULDNT MAKE OUT WHAT WAS GOING ON. THE DIALOGUE I COULD HEAR SOUNDED MUFFLED, OR UNCLEAR, SO I FIGURED I'D PUT THE SUBTITLES ON THE SCREEN. NO LUCK WITH THIS EITHER, THE SUBTITLES ARE ONLY IN SPANISH AND FRENCH, NEITHER OF WHICH I SPEAK. SO TO SAY THIS WAS A TERRIBLE REPRODUCTION OF THIS MOVIE IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT."
1,Sent a scratched DVD set,"You would think when buying new copies of products that when you opened it it wouldn't have a giant scratch. Well, that happened to my John Adams DVD set. I would suggest just going out and buying it, because you never know if you're going to get a DVD set that you can barely play.Sincerely,A Pissed-Off Customer"
1,This is NOT THE 80's band,Don't be fooled into thinking this was the incredible 80's band out of Canada. IT IS NOT. It is a sixties band out of Phoenix. AND IT SUCKS. (Mostly because I was expecting the 80's band based on the reviews). Shame on Amazon for letting reviews stay up that leads one to believe it was them. Unless you like poorly recorded late sixties music (it sounds like a bad LP) Don't bother. It would probably cost me more to return it at this point; wish I hadn't wasted the money!
1,Save your money,"I have an interest in organic gardening and from what I have read about the properties of Amazonian Dark Earths, I believed this would be a very desirable book to own. I was mistaken. It is basically a bunch of scientific papers bundled together and given a cover. It is NOT a how to book. Save your money!"
1,Be Careful of Imported DVDs,"Zoverstocks is a U.K. seller from whom I bought a DVD called ""Dead Reckoning"" starring Bogart and Liz Scott. I went directly to check out and didn't look at their second screen which outlined in clear enough detail that this imported (to the USA) DVD may not be viewable on all DVD players in the U.S. The fact is, most DVD players sold in the U.S. are Region 1. The DVD is made for Region 2 (Europe). As a result, I spent $8.50 (including shipping) for a DVD I can't play and that can't be cost-justified to return. Beware of the country of origin when buying anything on Amazon. We Americans (or less sophisticated shoppers) need to understand that not everything is made for Americans even if it's about that great American movie star, Humphrey Bogart."
1,AVOID THIS BOOK AT ALL COST <G>!,"I really wanted to love this book. As a long time X File fan, I was thrilled to hear Art one morning on the way to work. After listening to the spooky late night host several times, I couldn't wait to get his book...Then I read it. A series of unlinked random thoughts which apparently have no connection, except to occasionally contradict each other, changed this cult hero into a babbling fool. THis is quite unfortunate."
1,French guy gets stuck in Gypsy village,"Having enjoyed the music and patient non-narrative pacing of Latcho Drom, my friends and I tracked down this other Gypsy-themed film by the same director, Tony Gatlif. Unfortunately this one has far less of the sublime music and tries to tell a story. A young Parisian fellow travels to Romania to find a favorite Gypsy singer of his late father's. He enters a Romany (Gypsy) village and is unable to leave, though I can't imagine why. All the residents do is complain and curse in incredibly foul expletives. Any child old enough to read should not be allowed to watch this endless barrage of foul profanity. If a child is too young to read the subtitles then it would be ok since the dialogue is in Romanes, French, and Romanian. The only redeeming feature of this film, other than the occasional musical moments, is the opportunity to view the life of an oft-ignored culture, but this film is a wholly unpleasant experience."
1,It's been done...,This documentary is nothing new even though it purports to augment the Valkyrie plot story with details. It was disappointing and mercifully short. It doesn't go into the kind of detail I was hoping for in regard to the setting of the stage for the audacious revolt which was attempted and which failed so spectacularly.I suspect there are much better productions out there somewhere.
1,Worthless,"Looked good in theory, but our 10 month old pulled this off the toilet in ~ 30 secs (& yes it was installed correctly)"
1,Funny aftertaste,"We recently took gluten out of my daughter's diet and this is the first gf pancake mix we have tried. My daughter wouldn't eat it and said it had a funny aftertaste. I tried it after she did, and had to agree.The mix itself is very easy to use and cooks up nicely. It just didn't taste like pancakes to us (even with chocolate chips added in). We will try some of the other mixes to see if they have a better taste."
1,"If it were possible to give 0 stars, I would.","Let's start with the music quality. There is none. Once again, the Stage Stars Modus Operandi is to use music that is at least a decade old midi technology; this is absolutely inexcusable in an era when a company can buy music samples from philharmonic orchestras. Secondarily, the tempo on many of the songs is too fast. Third, and again, a major bone of contention, is if a KARAOKE company is going to take the time to produce a song with a counterpoint lyric duet, then to not include counterpoint lyric encoding is totally unacceptable."
1,Elementary school returns,"I bought this book because it was required (a textbook for a class I was taking). Because it was a college-level class, I was expecting a college-level textbook. That's not what it is at all. The book is filled with color illustrations that aren't even very helpful. I was hoping for more reading and explanation of terms. Illustrations are great if they are used right -- to compliment the text instead of replace it. I wouldn't recommend this book for someone who is serious about learning the ins and outs of networking."
1,Disappointed and kinda irritated,"As an educator, I was really looking forward to reading this book. I looked forward to reading about ways to open the minds of students. Sadly, that's not what this book offers.What I got from it was ""if you're not willing to sacrifice ALL of your spare time and money and put your family behind your career, then you are not going to succeed as a teacher."" The author preached on and on about how he was so willing to make these sacrifices... It really seemed like he was stroking his own ego with this book.Do yourselves a favor and don't read this. LouAnne Johnson's books did way more for me than this one."
1,"Very Stupid, do not waste your time","This is really ridiculous and one of many attempts to deface the truth of the Holy Quran. The publisher thinks they would be able to change Muslims' minds and hearts by this piece of garbage. This is really stupid and shows how 'they' really naive. They wasted their money and papers actually.It is full of misspellings, typos and obscene language.This is really anti-Muslim and I urge Amazon to remove this book from their bookshelves right away."
1,unimpressed,"i am unimpressed with this product. the griddle is nice, but the forman grill is unimpressive. it does not brown your food fast enough. by the time it gets around to browning your food (especially steaks) the inside of your food is overcooked! DON'T BUY,IT'S A WASTE YOUR MONEY AND YOUR COUNTERSPACE!!!!!"
1,Lack of original ideas...,"I bought this book seeking teaching ideas for the birth to 3 age group. While some of the activities for older children (in this case, age 3) would be engaging, the majority of ideas/information is useless and outdated. There are other books on the market that do a better job of collecting/relaying teaching ideas for young children."
1,Wellllll.......,"i agree with Elijah5585, its all ""yay"" and fun by the look of the product but... i bought it and it smells, its extremely sticky, and by making the ""smoke"" its like feather weight strings of the liquid that floats. i hope its not toxic, i got animals. Maybe i'll put a video of it soon"
1,"Could be great, but...","I tried both the XBOX MC2 and the Universal MC2 on my XBOX with similar results: the XBOX wheel would disconnect at least once in every game, though I was able to press start to resume- with the Universal, the wheel would just lock up and the console had to be powered down completely. I could not even begin to recommend this wheel due to the inconvenience of this issue that seems to be pervasive, reading all of the comments here and on the internet."
1,run small,"these slippers fit like a size smaller,they run very short and narrow. tried to wear them to see if they would stretch but they didnt."
1,Just not helpful at all for me,Maybe this book can help some but with the questions and work needed with a spouse even though the book says you can do the excersises by yourself its impossible..Im glad I bought it used..I read it..and tossed it..if you have someone you can do the work with great..but it dididnt do anything for me at all...B.W.
1,Is this really by red storm!?,"I own every rainbow six game. I am so so so disappointed, the textures in the game were old. Details were left out big time, I expected this to be the best on account of it being the newest, and probobly the last add on to rogue spear. And I know my guns big time, red storm paid no attention to making the guns real like. Basicly this was a last attempt to make more money, but it was worth it because it expanded th multiplayer possiblilities. I say if you like playing it online, go for it. But if you want something more than just covert ops, dont get it. I dont want to knock red storm down completely, but i play operation flashpoint. If you've played it, you would know what im talking about."
1,HELP,Im looking for the name of the song that played after Shane told the team that Martel had crossed and it went back in forth from Shane then Annabelle sitting @ the table with candles and so on.... (please email me the name of the song!! :) jchiesa@hotmail.com
1,Keen sandal poor quality,"Keen Newport SandalMy first Keen sandals lasted years. I actually wore the heels out of the soles through many years of wear. My newest Keens, bought in march 2011, suffer stitching failures on both sides of the ankle, both sandals, where the back ankle strap attaches underneath the logo flap on the sides of the ankle. Sadly, as both sandals failed in the same area, this is a quality issue. These sandals have proven to be not worth the cost. I will ask Keen to replace them and if they do, I will be satisfied. if they do not, I will not shell out this amount of money for a sandal that does not last five months."
1,POS,"I purchased this toaster in November of 2007 from Amazon. Yesterday, it broke. The product brochure told me that the toaster has a 3 year warranty. I called Cuisinart. They told me that they would replace the toaster but that I would have to pay shipping to receive the replacement and to return the defective unit to them, The shipping would cost more than the toaster. What a waste! I used to think that Cuisinart stood for quality. No more."
1,Can't get into this,"I have heard Air quite a bit on XM in the past couple of years, and their music always seems to get my attention. So, when I saw this in a local pawn shop a few days ago, I thought it would make for some neat listening in my newly-purchased 2005 Ford Five Hundred. I played it a couple of times when I realized this collection just wasn't what I was hoping it would be - that it might sound very interesting on first listen but the novelty starts fading fast upon repeated listens. I believe that Air has much better music available than this direction-less, experimental fluff. I'd recommend avoiding this album and try some of their others."
1,Too Slow Even for a Melodrama,"Birth has a thought-provoking story, beautiful setting, superb acting, an unnerving scene and a lush score. It lacks, however, fluency and vigor, both of which are essential to any satisfactory moviegoing experience. I understand it's a melodrama, but it crawled even by melodrama standards. There are way too many long pauses that don't really serve any purpose or convey anything. Nicole Kidman never looked better, in my opinion, and that alone was worth sitting through this film. I would wait till it comes out on DVD and I would only rent it!"
1,Beware MONO!,"I'd be tickled if this box set was in stereo or had a couple of mono cuts only because they were the better version. But the 1'st CD only plays out of the left channel in mono!? If a company is going to do a mono recording, for heavens sake, have it coming out of both channels!! I duplicated the process in several different players, but was absolutely bummed when I eagerly put in my reference system for the first time & heard that!! Buyer beware."
1,This movie is a lame knock-off,"This movie is a terribly amateurish attempt at computer animation. The faces are expressionless, the movements unnatural; and the voices don't match the characters at all. My son (aged 10) and I watched for about 15 minutes, and couldn't stand it any longer. Don't waste your time or money on this movie."
1,Christians beware!,"While this book provides some minor insights into sexual technique, it is rooted in a false worldview. In order to apply the teaching of this book in the way the authors intend, one needs to embrace some form of pantheism (e.g., Hinduism), wherein everything is divine in some sense, and all is one.Whereas this book depends upon the idea of lovers being divine, from a Christian perspective, God alone is divine, while people are not (though we are made in His image). And whereas the book's notion of sexual union involves tapping into the ""oneness"" of the universe, the Bible does not at all.For a Christian take on sex, see Sexual Character: Beyond Technique to Intimacy, by Marva Dawn, available on Amazon.com. For a Christian how-to manual, see Intended for Pleasure, by Ed Wheat.Let us not be drawn into a view of sex that is rooted in a view of the world that is at odds with the Bible, simply because it can make us feel good."
1,just pathetic.,"overacting, incoherent and meandering dialog and script, nothing made sense, nothing was cohesive, the plot was mindless boredom. Total crap and to think another is coming forth soon. Horrendous over acting, simpleton scenes with big name stars in trite horrid dialog. What a shame. Actors became objects of their own ego's and then think every scene they do is immortal, timeless. Its obvious this franchise is in it for the bucks, as the lemmings will salivate to the theater to see films like this, but we all know they are marketed for the very lowest common denominator of film goer.TOTAL AND ABSOLUTE garbage."
1,Academic Study of Saladin and his role in the Muslim Empire,This is a dry biography of Saladin and his role in the Muslim Empire. It provides a thorough study of the rise of Saladin and his family and the politics of the Arab world. There is little in this book to bring the man or the period to life for a lay reader interested in Arab history.
1,played for 3 days and then got bored!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"If i had to put this game into a few words then i would say: truley horrible.where do i start. well, the graphics are a little less then supbar. and the gameplay is just downright boring. This is mainly because the bad guys are stupid little blobs and bats. The whole game is one bad cliche after another. you can either be a gladiator (sword fighting is extremely frustrating because of air units and land units) or a girl that uses magic (magic particularly sucks because you have to summon a spell and then cast it and it seems to be not even worth the while because it does little damage and wastes huge magic points) I got bored after 2 days and would hugely not recommend it.graphics: 1fun factor: 0.5frustration: 5!!!!!!!!!!!!plot:0!!!!!!!!good for killing time (yes or no): heck no!!!!!cliche factor: 4worth your money? absolutely not"
1,Will the real Linda Howard please stand up?,"As promised the last time, I didn't buy this one - I got it from the library. And I'm glad I didn't waste my money. If I could have rated this under a 1 star, I would have.I'll be glad when Linda gets over whatever is making her write such dreadful books and goes back to the style that made me count the days until her next release."
1,"Daddy and Daughter say ""Two thumbs Down""","My little girl is a big fan of Lazytown and of Julianna Rose Mauriello so I thought this would be a good DVD for her. Especially since she's just learning basic math.I was wrong.My daughter was quick to point out the poor production value. ""Daddy, why does it sound like that?"" ""Daddy, why are there lines buzzing through the kids?"" ""Daddy...why did it suddenly get loud?""AWFUL sound quiality, Video that is riddled with noise and a post-production inserts of Julianna Rose Mauriello throughout the video to make it look like she was part of the production.I can't help but feel that Mauriello was probably sorry she got involved with this one.The math songs talk a lot about how fun math is but in most cases only share one or two siple 1+1 problems.My daughter is the judge here: ""Daddy... this is pretty bad. Why are they doing that song again?""Daddy and Daughter say ""Two thumbs Down."""
1,Caterwalling !,My wife is a Jeanette MacDonald fan ~ I have to leave the room when she plays them. Oh my!
1,"Nothing new, meh","This year's edition of the After Dark Horrorfest, retitled After Dark Originals, so far offers nothing we haven't seen before. Case in point with Husk, a tale about five young friends who break down in farm country and wind up becoming fodder for a murderous zombie scarecrow. Yes, you read that right. Husk offers a few scares and some decent gore effects, but the end result is pretty lacking to say it lightly thanks to a clueless, predictable script. Still, it's well filmed and the ending packs a little bit of punch, so you could do far, far worse in terms of disposable horror flicks to check out on a lazy day."
1,Why?,It is not fair that this t.v series has already been out on DVD and it was on way AFTER Charmed!!! This show [stinks]! Charmed should be out on DVD instead. I don't recommend this DVD at all!
1,Awful Waste of Time,"This is the first book by Johansen that I've read, and it will be the last. This has a disappointingly ridiculous plot, with characters that are extremely annoying. They are forever doing the least prudent thing in any situation. A killer is after them, but they go about exposing themselves to danger at every turn. The main female is a nasty tempered nag. That two men would find her attractive is baffling. I wanted to stop reading half way through, but I hate giving up on a book. I finished it and am glad it's over."
1,Annoying and bad!!,"This show is bad! I watched the first 2 seasons and thought maybe it be a fun long journey of a series. But what garbage!The Meridith and Derek relationship is so revolting. I was hoping that they would move on from each other. Addison is the only real character worth liking and for Derek to choose bimbo Meredith put the end of me watching this. Done. And Cristina is so hard to look at, how can such an unattractive woman being on a popular show. I think Izzy is a good actress...but her relationship with the patient and stealing an organ...and the hospital and friends understanding her behavior...bad, bad bad. I am so glad that there is Private Practice to follow...although all the incestuous relationships happen in the practice, the episodes are still interesting medical stories."
1,"Disappointing - Little content, lots of flashing images","We expected more from NG. These videos were mostly just quick clips of various creatures, 5 seconds for most, and very little informational content. Good to plop the kids in front of if you want to distract them, not good at all for learning."
1,Disappointing,"I know, those who love Saramago unconditionally will be upset at this assessment, but this book could easily have been a short story or novella and got the same points across while being more to the point and powerful.I guess coming straight off Blindness, which, to me, is one of the best books ever written, this one just came up short (or long, actually).Also, and everyone has commented on this aspect of the book, but glowingly, the comment on modern capitalism and the contrast between the center and the potter are making points so OBVIOUS that they almost make no point at all. Capitalism bad. Little guy good. It's that simple. I think he could've been a little more subtle.I will say, I loved the character development and the idea of the ""Center"" (although, like I said, it's significance was painfully overt). What I didn't like was the ending, because I think it was cryptic for its own sake and didn't make the rest of the story add up."
1,did not see any difference,"I bought this for my daughter's toilet. The concept is great, but I didn't see any difference when it came to keeping it cleaner longer. I do not recommend buying."
1,G4050 Poor Vista Compatibility,"I bought this scanner for a local Historical Society so they could scan 16 slides at a time. I downloaded the ""Full Feature"" software for Vista and the scanner would not recognize the TMA adapter (the slide/negative scanner) no matter what I did. It did not even show up as a option in the Scanning features. I called the wonderful HP Tech Support number and got the infamous poor-English speaking Indian, that could only follow a checklist. After finally telling him to forget the checklist I asked him flat out if this was fully compatible with Vista, he said NO, but it will work sometimes on some systems. That was the end of my adventure with this scanner and got an RMA from Amazon to send it back. I'm off to buy Canon 8600 scanner WHICH is fully compatible with Vista. Do not buy this scanner!"
1,Unrewarding slog,"Ok, I just don't get it. ""Building the data warehouse"" feels like a padded and generally under-edited collection of essays on topics of varying interest. Its focus is ""orthogonal"" to that of Kimball's ""Data warehouse toolkit""; Chapter 13 is the easy-to-see overlap, but gave me no clue about the nature of the supposed ""Team Edward vs. Team Jacob""-scale conflict between the two camps. However, as far as writing is concerned, the comparison with Kimball's book is clearly not in favor of Inmon's thicker tome, highlighting its frustrating tendencies for vagueness and hand-waving."
1,Seller should change his description,"I thought this item was too good to be true. The description says it is a 12 pack. It even lists the original price of $38.49 which would be the price of a dozen pens. Wow, I thought 12 of one of the best pens made for only $2.44. A little hard to believe, but I jumped at the opportunity to buy them at this price, even though the shipping was rather high. As it turned out, I only received 1 pen, not a box of pens. What a disappointment. The seller needs to make the description clear that the price is for only 1 pen!"
1,Still waiting for my purchase place ove a month now,"I did not received my purchased item, even though I have paid for it. It is now over a month now and nothing.WHAT AM I TO REVIEW... THE UNRELIABILITY!!!!"
1,you get what you pay for,"If you don't sit on it, or plug it in, it will last forever. However, if you use it, it may crap out in a matter of minutes or days. Trying to find a quality heated cushion is nearly impossible, and this product is no exception. Some have had luck with it, alas I did not."
1,Hardware failure,"I purchased the P3005X as a replacement for an HP4050, (have three of them in our offices, they are great printers). Right after this printer initialized, I began receiving various error messages (mainly 49.4C02 - printer error). Then a memory test failure, (""replace DIMM 01""). Went online with HP support, did various trouble-shooting (including re-seating the DIMM). Long story short: hardware failure. HP will replace this brand new printer with a refurbished printer, as long as I pay $69 for their Express Exchange service. Or, I can pack this printer back up and ship it to them so they can repair it and ship it back to me in 7-14 business days (I have to pay the shipping costs to HP). Either way, it's a hassle, I will definitely not buy another P3005 series printer."
1,Known Gnome,It is cute...sat in my office for months...with lots of positive comments. Took outside...light worked sometimes. Paint coming off after 12 days outside...these gnomes now live back inside....without any solar glow!
1,Not good,"I am so far pleased with this product. It appears durable and all that was advertised. It comes with a 1000 mile sole guarantee. That was my original opinion of the product when it arrived. The shoes are falling apart after 3 months, of light everyday wear. The stitching on the right toe area has come undone, and the tread is worn down on the bottom. Sorry I purchased them."
1,Poor Quality,"Usually I am fan of Bic products, but these mechanical pencils are awful. A local bookstore was having a clearance, and I bought a pack of two for 88 cents. For that price, I can't complaint. However, the quality of the lead is terrible. Every time I write with it the lead breaks. I don't like the feel of the lead when I am writing. I do like the grip and structure of the pen, but the lead quality is bad. The eraser is bad too. When I erase, the writing smears and it doesn't erase clearly. For 88 cents I won't complain and probably keep them. I will just use them as back up pencils. But I will not pay full price or recommend purchasing them."
1,wouldn't even play,The blu-ray disc won't even play. I have tried it in several blu-ray players and it gets 21 seconds into the icon entertainment logo then stops. I emailed the manufacturer over a month ago and that have not responded. Very disappointing
1,It's an average boring childern's book,This book was really a load of rubish and I don't know why people have raved over it. It's boring and is really a book for quite a young age group. Half the characters in it are really dumb for their age. It's not very good at all.
1,Worthless with OS X,"The keyboard is supposed to be compatible with OS X, but it's not. The biggest problem is that the keyboard is hypersensitive and repeats almost every letter, even with the system prefs adjusted. There's also a delay before anything appears on screen. So I guess it's also undersensitive. I found the joy stick hard to control, but maybe one could get used to it. The construction seems very cheap. Also: I emailed the company for help on the repeat keys over a week ago and got no reply. I'm returning to ergogeek, where I bought it. Ergogeek, by the way, seems like a great company. No complaints there."
1,Nice plot and beggining but very disappointing ending,"This book was really interesting in the beggining. I thought I was really going to enjoy it. The end was really stupid and I've read lots of R.L. Stine books and this one really disappointed me. I like the books where someone actually dies and there are many suspects, like Broken Hearts, that is my favorite book and it's by R.L. Stine. Well I don't think you should read this because it's really just wasting your time. But if your in for a practical joke to make someone go nuts, go for it!"
1,Can you say Michael Bolton?,"Sorry, but it is time for someone to utter a discouraging word. The only value to this album comes from reminding us of what was, and sending us back to the old vinyl. Sometimes, immitation indeed is the sincerest form of flattery. Other times, it just should not be done. Like here.These songs were better the first time around. ""Walk Away Renee"", ""Ask The Lonely"", and most of the others recorded here just don't hold a candle to the originals. And only in the interest of historical accuracy, to gently correct another reviewer, ""It's In His Kiss"" was recorded by Betty Everett fifteen years before Cher did (you could look it up!)Like Manilow singing Sinatra, of the aforementioned Bolton singing Percy Sledge, some things should just not be done."
1,Super scrabble board not made well,I do like the expanded version. I am not happy with how poorly the board is constructed. I received it in a broken state. Plastic hinges are not strong enough to hold the boards weight. I had to glue and tape it together so it will not fall apart anymore. Pretty pricey for poor weak plastic design.
1,not what I expected,"Doesn't ""dry"" the lettuce. No holes in the bowl so water sits on lettuce. Hard to put the top on, it fits weird. I really don't use it."
1,avoid like the plague,Magazine is fine but it didn't come for 6 months after ordering. Amazon blamed 3rd parties and wouldn't help. We will never order mags through Amazon.
1,Disappointing,"I just finished reading ""P is for Peril"" and I was extremely disappointed in the ending. After I read the last page, I was looking for the rest of the pages in the book. I was beginning to wonder if there were some pages missing. Then I said, ""That's it????""I agree with one of the previous reviewers who said that reading is our vacation. Reading is a rest for our minds. If I have to think that hard to figure out the ending to a book, then I won't bother with reading it in the first place. I have always enjoyed Sue Grafton's Kinsey series, but I think this one was lacking in humor and a good ending. Also, what happened to her usual report at the end?For all those folks who actually like to think hard about an ending, this is for you. But for those of us who want it wrapped up neat and clear, don't waste your time. I'm sorry I wasted mine."
1,i gotta go with the nay-sayers.,"I was curious to see if anyone writes bad reviews for albums on this site. Since everyone wants to write about the albums they love, every CD here is getting great reviews. I checked on this album becuase I felt it really sucked, and was curious to see what kind of things people wrote. I see that some people liked it, which is cool. I've heard this guy is well-respected for his dedication to his music. Well, good luck to him if that 's what he wants to do. Just wasn't my thing."
1,"""Montana Rail Link"" book.","""Montana Rail Link"" is a collection of black and white photographs by the author, taken across much, but not most or all, of Montana Rail Link railroad. It is a pictorial - not a history - of Montana Rail Link after its first decade of existance, with some good information. There are some factual errors contained and the book is lacking depth in both text and photographic coverage of this 600-plus bridge line across connecting two divisions of BNSF railroad in Montana."
1,Pass the cheese,"This was possibly the cheesiest film I've ever suffered through. My wife and I were literally howling in disbelief at the stupidity. The costumes were absurd, especially Sean Connery's get-up as the green night and Miles O'Keefes ""squire"" wig. Where did they get the wardrobe?? Dollar Store? Utterly awful no matter how you slice this one; Costumes, scenery, script...terrible...and the music/soundtrack (if you can call it that) sounded a recording of a 12-year old fiddling around with an old Casio keyboard, then dropped in a tub of water for a few weeks of warping before being added to the sound reels.......Connery must have been drinking heavily when he accepted this script....I'm sure after seeing the finished product, he regretted doing this film. This movie was so awful, I turned it off before it ended. Save your money."
1,"Looks great, low quality.","I bought this grill to replace a Weber I have had for over 5 years and aside from normal wear it has functioned well. This grill I have had for exactly 2 weeks and today the side handle detached from the grill when I went to move the grill. I examined the old grill and saw around 1/2"" of weld connecting the handle to the grill. The new one I purchased has less than 1/8"" of weld on each side of the handle and already was showing signs of bad rusting. I have contacted Weber in the hopes of a replacement. My only other complaint about this grill is that all of the internal grate supports had to be bent and adjusted to hold the grates without them rattling, it only took a minute but I think the same minute task could be completed by their staff."
1,nice idea but uncomfortable,"I have a size 9 foot and these socks are tight. tube shaped so very uncomfortable at the heel. Would not buy again, would return had I bought locally"
1,An Overwritten Mess,"I was seduced by the overall great reviews, and my huge admiration for ""Middlesex"". This was not in the same realm.The writing was beautiful, but there was entirely too much of it. It got to the point where I just felt like reading the ending to see how it all played out. There were so many unnecessary descriptions and events that they ceased to be relevant. After the first few chapters, the rest of the novel just left me with a profound disappointment that I would have to listen to these same voices over and over without truly finding out what made the characters tick. I'd skip this one."
1,Not much to it.,"This is a disappointing movie about cheerleading as a sport. You have the expected competition between the school with money and the school without funds for after-school programs such as cheerleading. The high-end school can purchase the services of a choreographer to create their routine for the annual cheer leading competition. The ""poor"" school scores financing by getting their story out to the media. The cheerleaders deliver their competing routines. That's about it. This movie isn't appropriate for pre-teens who I see would be the only interested audience. It would have needed some character development to provide an interesting movie to anyone over the age of 13."
1,Power switch doesn't always work,"The power switch works inconsistantly - after using for two months. Best chance of power staying on is to hold the swtich down while vacuuming. It blows so much air that you have to sneak up on dust bunnies or they fly away. It doesn't work well on tile floors, leaving dirt in the grout unless you repeatedly go over the floor. I replaced it with a Hoover S2220 that I'm very happy with."
1,Intuit Blows it.......AGAIN!!!,"What is the matter with this company? Do they read what is said about them online?I bought TurboTax Deluxe this year--thought I'd give them another chance after last year's fiasco--and only because they claimed to be able to import TaxCut files. No dice. The import was a disaster, and didn't include any of my wage info and capital loss carryovers. All it brought over was personal info.This piggybacks on the disaster that is Quicken 2004. I won't bore you with details but read the reviews about this piece of garbage elsewhere.Intuit....Get with the program...I mean, get with the PROGRAM!"
1,And I asked for this for Christmas . . . . .,"This book is insufferably bad. It lacks greatly for an editor. The author will switch tense 3 times in a single paragraph. The punctuation is horrible, and the content is lacking a clear organization. The depth of information does not go beyond simple statements: ""We learned this, then we learn that, and we will learn to do those."" She also needs to learn the virtue of pronouns as a way to avoid using the same word (in this case ""toque"") in 6 consecutive sentences.Do not buy this book. It will not satisfy anyone's quest for knowledge or interest in culinary school and will be impossible to read through the grammatical errors and dullness of discussion of an otherwisely interesting topic."
1,Dumbest video ever!,I am a fitness professional and have watched my share of fitness videos. This is the absolute worst video I have ever seen. She is just dancing with herself and throwing around little one pound weights. There is no way that Madonna is doing this workout. Very poorly produced and she is very unengaging and unenthusiastic. Big thumbs down.
1,The Dark Realms of The Internet,"""You will never satisfy a woman.Only a woman can satisfy herself, while you are but the mere connection that links the broad to something of monetary value.Go back to the dark realms of the internet from which you came from.Invest your time doing something meaningful on the internet; you will be more satisfied than any woman can make you.Close your eyes.Imagine a woman.Place your hand in your trousers.That is all the satisfaction you will receive from a woman.The internet has given you so much, and it has lead you here, the gates of Hell, for you to walk into unknowingly into an eternal abyss that is the woman's heart.Turn back!It is not to late!The internet has free porn!Rejoice, brothers!Haha!!!""Taken from the Authors Note.I was appalled."
1,Absolutely different from Lovecraft's work,"If you want a good movie based on ""The Colour Out Of Space"" by H.P. Lovecraft, look no further than ""Die Farbe"" - that is a masterful film which is fairly true to the original story and remains true to Lovecraft's Mythos throughout. This is a wretched little film. It is void of Lovecraft's mythos."
1,Disappointed,"I loved Ladies with options and was so excited to see a sequel. However, I found the Ladies with prospects almost boring compared to the last book. I read the other reviews on this book and purchased the book but disagree with the reactions"
1,Amazon needs to allow a 'ZERO star' rating,"Giving this movie 1 star is giving it more than it deserves. This movie is TERRIBLE. It has no story, unlikable characters, cheap sets and kills off two great characters saved in ALIENS. David Fincher has gone on to direct some quality movies (Seven, The Game) but I am sure he would rather forget this bomb. Save your money and save your time and watch something else."
1,The Fifth Element (Blu-Ray),The DVD on the blu-ray disk was bad news from the git-go. We tried to play the movie twice before we noticed the bad lines on the disk. The bad line couse the movie to stop playing or some skipping off and on. I never had this problem before and now it has happened twice in the same month and all on Blu-Ray.
1,No Passionate love story,"Ok, at first the story was very interested, I was hooked on the first two chapters, then it go very tedious, the story leaves you feel cheated, the only best character is Ophelia, she is very self centered she is the bad guy. But it seems like the two main characters just ignored each other. Duncan could have been more a man and fought for Sabrina, and Sabrina is too forgiving."
1,Disapointing,"I guess my disapoitment with the ballets have to do with my expectations from them. Both ballets are minor works of great russians composers; I had never seen them on stage or video. But the music appeals to me. Then, having a first experience based on poor soviet productions, where the emphasis is on big pannels and less in showing the best the dancers can perform is rather less than one should expect as a reference recording. It has all the vices of sovietic recorfings of ballets, and was badly edited for modern patterns. To me, it's value is purely bibliographical: compared to modern creative and/or sumptuous productions, it makes one think: What marvellous ballets Nureyev, or Ballachine, could have done of them!"
1,tried hard - but generally forgettable,My second Mccammon book after the wonders of Boy's Life and i knew not to expect much from this early attempt at a horror novel It starts ok-ish but ends up as some James bond story that is just beyond belief. The characters are tame and I just couldnt care how it was going to end. He tried hard to make it creepy but really over did it making everything appear scary and therefore taking away the surprise element. what got me was how he tried to introduce a quaint Englishness into the dialect by saying 'by God' all the time. But this is Middle America Robert ?
1,Unbelievable,"I saw these guys on MTV, I just had to say some thing about them, and the only thing that came to mind was (...). Who would listen to this junk and actually like it, it's insane. Reach for the sun or whatever is so Brady Bunch on shrooms it's pitiful. If music is heading in this direction, someone really needs to do something about it. 0 stars."
1,When children are abused for the gain of adults and authors.,"I am very disturbed about the subject of this book and its review in the New York Times Book Review. It is a work of fiction. Clearly it describes both the external manipulation of children by adults and their vulnerability to exploitation by those adults and children of their own age. My question is this: Did the author need to make this point by using such a destructive context? Or was the context self-serving for the author...to produce such sensationalized work that it would be noted for its content rather than its merit as a novel. I am disturbed by what this novel says about our moral culture and the popularity of abuse/dis-function novels. I believe we are better than this. And if we are not, we have great cause to worry about our future."
1,This Book Sucks!,"From the cover to the end, I was disappointed. I kept reading in hopes that it would get better, but it didn't. It was a lousy ending ant the beginning just rambled on and on. I love vampire books, but I'll never read this one again."
1,Buyer BEWARE,"This item is cute and sturdy. However, the seller has it listed as being 50 lb shipping weight. Mine arrived and did not even weigh 5 lbs including all the packaging material. They gave me a refund for most of my shipping and said they would change their listing. Two months later it is still saying 50 lbs. The price for this bird bath is right on with what it is worth - but the deceptive shipping makes this a bad purchase"
1,Dented & damaged,Opened the box and it was caved in on one side but installed it anyway because it was hot. Turned it on and it didn't work! Hassle to get a replacement!!
1,Missing the letter J,"I think this is a great toy. My kiddo loves to move them around on the fridge. However, When I put them on the fridge it order we were missing a capitol J. Boo."
1,Not enough Disney,"I hate to sound like an ingrate writing this review: Herb Ryman has done some great illustrations. Unfortunately, this book spends too much time showcasing Herb Ryman's non-Disney art--which is pretty mediocre--and not enough space showcasing his Disney work. The highlight of the book--Ryman's first illustration of the soon-to-be-built Disneyland--is spread across two pages, but the page break makes it nearly impossible to decipher what's in the middle of the drawing. (It should have perhaps been on a fold-out, or at least on a single, uninterrupted page.) Other great illustrations, especially early renderings of Tomorrowland, are printed in extremely small 3"" images, making them very hard to read. All in all, I'd say don't bother with this book. Ryman's best drawings are already showcased in many other books."
1,tribute? no you mean INSULT,"I am a big fan of Mariah Carey's work, but even if I wasn't, I would still be appalled by what I just heard when I listened to some track samples. I can't even start to imagine who gave the go for that cd to leave the studio! This goes out to that person: what, are you deaf?! The voice on that record is trully disturbing. To make this short, I'll jsut say that if this cd had been a so-called tribute to grandma, I would still be appalled!! Thank God for the ""listen to samples"" link on this website."
1,Doesn't work on old computers,I have been buying S&T; since it came out. I've enjoyed it until S&T; 2008.I have an old computer with a CD drive. The new S&T; comes with a DVD. It will not load on my computer. Contacted Microsoft and they told me to upgrade my computer and they could not and would not help me get it loaded.Very disappointed with Microsoft and will now have to look for a product I can use on my old computer.
1,"A Great Soap Opera!!!!!....Wait a minute, this was WRESTLING!?!","The minute I watched this ppv I thought it was a joke. I thought they were being bad on purpose and Vince McMahon would pop out and say ""Nah just kidding, here's the real Great American Bash!"" If Eddie vs Rey didnt take place, this would be the Worst ppv EVER!!!!!!! Rey vs Eddie is a classic match so rent this DVD, copy that match onto your computer, and give it back. The rest is so terrible I cant put it into words. Great american Bash was a great tradition back in WCW! In WWE, it looks like a joke. I want WWE to keep GAB but for god sakes, next year make it at least DECENT!"
1,This was a real disappointment,"My 4 year old daughter got this for Christmas. The cold and warm water barely did anything to change the color of Barbie's eye shadow and lips. The nails were a little better but not much. By the time you painted the nail with warm water, the water would cooled off enough that they turned back the normal color. We ended up not using the water and my daughter uses her play make up on the doll head. The hair is the best part, and it was a disappointment. The hair was so matted when I opened the package, that I took over an hour getting the tangles out for her. She can get a comb through it now, but I have to come and detangle from time to time."
1,Leaks!!!,"Despite proper setup (yes, I did read instructions!) this tub still slowly leaks! I have to keep adding water to it during bath. What a hassle. Definitely would not recommend."
1,a complete waste of money,"Don't waste your money on this one. The suction cups are so small and thin that the soap dish does not stay up long. I should have known before I bought it. Next time, I'll get the one with bigger suction cups or the one with power suction."
1,Don't buy this lighter,"this lighter is impossible to fill, the piece at the bottom is very hard to turn and finding the right tool to turn it is very hard. I can't believe i wasted 30something dollars on a piece of crap. Do not buy this lighter!!!"
1,Only recommended for the cooking impaired,"I bought this book after having subscribed to Cooking Light magazine. The easy, healthy and tasty recipes they offered every month made me think that ""The 5 Ingredient 15 Minute Cookbook"" would be another great resource. How wrong I was! This book has proven to be nothing but a disappointment.The recipes in this book are easy and quick, but they are bland and uninspiring. Most of the ""tips"" for making quick, nutritious meals are really shortcuts that any competent cook could come up with (i.e. using pre-cut stir-fry meat or pre-sliced frozen vegetables). Quite honestly, these recipes *taste* like they only have 5 ingredients and only took 15 minutes to slap together. In other words, the recipes only have five ingredients because they left out the flavorful ones!My advice: DON'T buy this book. Try a subscription to Cooking Light or another of their cookbooks. This one just doesn't measure up."
1,Am I the only one who hated it?,"While the idea itself is good, and it reminds me of what could have been before the movie ""I Am Sam"" took place, I thought the story was quite poorly written. It read more like a how-to guide for dealing with developmentally delayed people, using lots of ""personal anecdotes"" and hypothetical stories."
1,Very Disappointing,"I bought this software to replace an old Visual Home software I have had for many years. I will probably uninstall Punch and re-install Visual Home because Visual Home is much easier to work with. Also, my old software has much better kitchen and bathroom fixtures, furniture and at least offers more garage/shop items to place in the model. The only advantages to this Punch software is the deck design and the fact that you can design additional floors over the first floor footprint. I have not gone as far as using the furniture workshop and the RealModel--I don't think I will waste my time. This WAS NOT money well spent."
1,Get Volume 1 only!!!!,Volume 1 is the best of all of them. Volumes 2 and 3 are terrible!!! My 5 year old daughter loves the first one.
1,not worth the paper it's printed on,"The paper used for this ""book"" MADE GREAT CAT BOX LINERS, OTHER THAN THAT DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY. The author's telling of this story is boring and unreal, the author has no idea how to even start, much less maintain a good story. The only knowledge this author has is that she is probably the other woman!!!!"
1,I Don't Get It!!!,"Can somebody explain to me why we even listen to Patti Smith? I saw her recent performance on a CBS morning show and it was terrible. She butchered classic songs from Tear For Fears and the Rolling Stones. It was absolutely embarrassing to watch. Why has Patti Smith ever been relevant? Would we even know who she was if she didn't come from New York (you can include Lou Reed in this question). To me, she isn't even a has-been....more of a never-was. Also, a memo to the artists(?) who are now producing cover song albums.....do not do it! You are lowering yourself to what it ws like before you ever gained fame. Is Brian Ferry listening? At least he did produce some great stuff in the past.Patti Smith can thank god for: New York, Rolling Stone magazine, and a hall of fame (in Cleveland no less)willing to showcase items such as a cub scout uniform for Jim Morrison....LOL (I required to rate a minimum of 1 star)."
1,a waste of paper,"This book is the result of brilliant marketing, and horrible writing.Save yr money.Look elsewhere for clever writing."
1,Absolutely Repulsive,"There are not enough thumbs in the world to put down. This is a disgrace to the wonderful band called Incubus. All copies of this product should be destroyed. Please, listen to the previous commentator and save your money for something enjoyable. I have no problem with the individual bands, they should just make their own music and not destroy that of Incubus. Enjoy the real Incubus."
1,Not very good.,"Brookfield has some excellent books on grip training with many good techniques.This, however, is full of really, really basic techniques for using cables, things that you would think of yourself in about 30 minutes if you pick up some cables and have a go.There are so many other things you can do with them that are not even touched upon. There are other books on cables / bands work that are far more comprehensive / useful. ""Therapeutic Exercises using the Resistive Bands"" by Caroline Corning Creager comes to mind.John what are you doing! I was hoping this book would be chock-full of innovative techniques. It looks mostly empty, full of white space, a few bad photos of some really basic techniques.About the only innovative thing was to use a towel through the handle to extend the range / give the grip a bit of work.So sadly I have to give this book one star. A waste of time and effort.His other books on hand strength are good though."
1,Couldn't get past first chapter,"It's very possible that the plot and character development are first-rate. I wouldn't know, because I couldn't get past the inferior writing. My guess is that much of the problem lies in an editor who couldn't be bothered to edit the cliches and repeated words (the king is ""disgusted"" two sentences after he says something ""in disgust"").I was actually stuck in a car for nine hours when I picked this up, and chose to stare out the window instead. The only reason I'm not giving it one star is because it seemed to have potential as far as the plot."
1,Wasn't This Book Mentioned Somewhere In The Biblical End-Times Descriptions Of Revelation?,"If you could get the impression once in a while that she isn't serious under the joking tone some editor has injected here, this might work for a laugh. But I think Paris Hilton is all-too serious: this IS how she lives, thinks, acts. I didn't buy this, by the way, my cousin has it and I read it over there. Before anyone wastes money on this book, give the purchase price to charity, invest it on a pyramid scheme, drop it for someone else to find. Do not, via your purchase, encourage this girl to hire someone to write a sequel!Someone hide all of Paris Hilton's recording devices before she writes--I mean dictates--again!!!!!"
1,ugh,"Will someone please shoot this kid? This guy sucks, always has and always will. If this is what pop music has come to, I'm ashamed to share the same Earth as him and his followers. Worthless garbage."
1,Yuck,"Bad trouble with my Toshiba DVD. Ran for a couple days. Then ate 2 discs, refusing to start. Electronics on it just stopped working. Not at all happy."
1,PASS ON THIS ONE,"There are many better wrestling games than Nitro. The control is flat out poor. I like to find strong points in any game, but THQ and the programmers were not thinking of the gamer when they wrote this one. Sorry guys, but this game stinks.Jason"
1,not so happy,"Although I bought this bed for my dog, as she is getting old and has arthritis, I was hoping it would of lasted longer than it has. She didn't abuse it any more than a child would under normal circumstances, probably even less since all she does is get in and out of it. One of the center seams popped out and it is unusable now. I've only had it since September. I do own other Aerobeds and they have been fabulous and lasted a long long time. I'm very disappointed in this one. For the money that I spent on it, it should have lasted longer than 5 months. They should put that felt stuff on the one side, like they do with the bigger beds. It seems to be much sturdier. I will know not to buy something like this at Amazon so that I could have returned it after 30 days."
1,"Looks great at first, then quickly fades in the sunshine","I used this outdoors on metal and plastic in order to more easily see low posts and utility boxes when backing out my car. The areas were first primed/undercoated with KILZ oil-based spray primer.After a few weeks, the Rust-Oleum began to noticeably fade. Now, two months later, the yellow is almost gone from the surfaces subjected to direct sunlight. The white KILZ undercoating shows no signs of fading, I would add."
1,Soooo cheap!,Even at the add-on price this item is way over-priced. Do not pay more than 99 cents for a water globe that leaks and comes in the flimsiest cardbox box possible.
1,Utter Crap,This book is the biggest piece of crap I've ever read - and I read a lot! How it ever got published is the real mystery! Don't waste your time on it.
1,Didn't work,When I received the product it was defective and now I can't get my money back for 3 weeks....
1,"NOT compatible with my Andis clipper, purchased at the same time!",I moved to another contry and now found that I need to do all my Maltese's grooming. I ordered these combs and it was advertised that they are Universal. They are NOT. I spent a lot of money to over night ship them to me and when they got here they are too small for the blade. I spent 4 hours hand scissoring my dog. Then next day had to do the legs. I counted on the info to be right and it's not.
1,Hope you power never goes out,"No battery backup. If the power goes out for more than 10 minutes, well you're out of luck and it resorts to flashing 12:00 a.m. Why on earth would Sony make such a terrific CD/AM/FM/TV, etc. radio without such a feature? If they add battery backup, it would be worth 5 stars, but my power is not that reliable."
1,"Ordered ""XL"", ACTUALLY ""LG"", shrank to ""MED"". Tummy shows.","These are not heavy shirts, and shrink like Swap Meet Specials. Order TWO sizes bigger. Not a great deal."
1,"Good research, bad approach","Since this is written by a doctor it contains plenty of research. The problem is that this (male) doctor is goal oriented, it's about sleep at all costs. The main thrust of any technique given is to let your child cry until he goes to sleep by himself. Not sure if that is really a solution at all, and it certainly doesn't take into account a child's emotional development. If you are OK with your child crying to sleep then just do it and you don't really need to read a book. If you want solutions that take into account your child's emotions and feelings then I'd suggest The No-Cry Sleep Solution which contains many of the same facts found herein but then goes on to provide many non-crying approaches to sleep."
1,Not so original!,"Initially I thought that this book was great, one of the few Tarot books that combined the Tarot, Kabbalah, numerology, symbology and astrology. But on closer reading I found that the author had copied chunks of text from the classic tarot book ""The Tarot"" by Paul Foster Case without either refering to Case or explaining his comments further. This is pretty disgraceful, I think they call it plaigiarism."
1,OK,"It was ok. i was expecting more from Vargas Llosa!It was sort of boring actually. The flow was kind of ""here and there and everywhere""... I think that the presentation of the facts fell short and missed a lot of points. :-("
1,why?,"This review reveals a bit of the ending, so don't read it if you don't want the ending spoiled. (Though by the time you get to the end you're just glad to be there).One of my (too many) hobbies is esoterica. So a book like this should have been a treat. I can follow more of the arcane references than the average reader, I reckon.But the book is all intellect and no imagination or soul. The plot is not interesting or believable. Nor are the characters. The characters don't even care about each other. (At the end, the narrator's best friend is hung by a group of theosophists and the narrator doesn't intervene or get upset but simly engages in abstract speculation.)Read it for the few chapters on the history of the templars, and for the overview of esoterica. But not for the plot, or the theme, or the characters, or for any other reason you normally read a book."
1,Boring PR for Mexican Americans,"Yes, Latinos, both legal and illegal, play a very important role in our economy. Only an uneducated bigot refuses to see that. I'm grateful for the Latinos in this country. Heck, I married one! But this movie is a stupid, unfunny attempt to push that point. It's not entertaining in the slightest and they insulted my intelligence by repeatedly pointing out the obvious."
1,See Chicken Run or Titan A.E. Instead,"I wasn't impressed with this video. Some of the fighting and special effects were neat (though not always believable), but the plot was unoriginal. The computer break-in scene reminds one very much of Mission Impossible (1). The storyline jumps and shifts too much for comfort, without being surprising -- as if someone up top couldn't settle on this version or that. And the girls run on sexy scenes -- sporting skimpy clothes and conveniently unzipped water suits -- instead of showing some real personality. The skin plus some questionable language makes ""Charlie's Angels"" unsuitable for family viewing.Too bad; the crime-fighting team, backed by an anonymous millionaire, wasn't that bad of an idea. And the way the girls obviously loved him, unseen, was cute too. The redhead's glimpse of Charlie, near the end, is poignant; you imagine she'll treasure that forever. Anyone interested in a remake?"
1,Loved Seaslon 1 not so much season 2,"I don't know, it is like the writers ran out of ideas that had anything to do with a community college at all. It was just weird."
1,THIS IS A RIPOFF,i got this in the mail i charged it for sevral hours and plugged it in once i got the battery in the fore grip i started to shoot it with ammo in it of course five minutes in working great 6 min i re filled the mag 8 minutes it stopped with a loud thud science this is my first AEG i thought the battery was dead so i plugged it in and 2 hours later i plugged it in again it did not work i checked it there was a jam nope no jam i made sure there was ammo in it yes a full mag i was pissed i just spent over $100 that i worked to get and it did not and dose not work! i search airsplat and find the manual on line did i mention it did not have the manual or the speed loader. i dont reccomend this for anyone this i heavy peace of junk. so if you are a billion are and want to waste your money then go ahead and waste it.however if this revew dose not stop you from ordering and you are lucky and get one thet works then lucky you i think it fired great when it did work.
1,Full Body Streatch Review,Too advanced and difficult stretches. It was like advanced yoga. I was looking for something more basic and geared to folks over 50.
1,"Not for a new Christian, lots of false doctrine.",I lead a bible study based on this book and spent most of my time correcting errors in the way the bible was interpreted with out the use of surrounding scripture. She is correct the battle does begin in your mind but this is not the book to use to correct your mind. Start with the bible. New Christians may not notice false doctrine so if you are looking to do a bible study on this book be prepared to do a lot of correcting.
1,WHAAAT? No KISS???,I won't even bother buying this CD since it does not include one song from the popular and terrific MTV Unplugged session with KISS!
1,Failed in a week; customer support is dire,Caveat emptor. A beautiful piece of design and technology but is it reliable? Mine broke within a week of purchase. The customer support is useless.
1,INAPPROPRIATE FOR CHILDREN,"I can't imagine what a child could learn from this book. The plot is trite, the characters pathetic and unlikeable, the language foul, and the writing juvenile. The book is supposedly the childrens' perspective after their father murders their mother. He apparently does so because she is going to expose his adultery with a student. In the end it is explained that ""Who you are and what you are is partly because of who your parents,your grandparents, and even the ones before them were...We humans like to think we are free to choose our life. Maybe we are and maybe we aren't"". The book then goes on to explain that the father has murdered their mother because of some perceived childhood traumas. Atleast in the end the daughter ""walks slowly away"". Luckily we're free to choose what books we read. Don't waste your time on this one."
1,Boring,"I have lived in India and was looking forward to reading this book especially as I'd enjoyed another one of the author's books. After three chapters I gave up. Put simply, it was boring."
1,Obvious Quote Mining,"This book won't appeal to anybody, except those who want it to be true. It is obvious quote mining. (Check out Talk Origins for a discussion on how quote mining is used, especially in this book) If you need to lie in order to believe something, it is not much of a belief, in my opinion."
1,What POW MIA Information?,"This book was VERY disappointing! Other than a very few isolated second hand stories of POW's 'somewhere over the next ridge line' there is virtually NO information on POW's. Lt Col Simons tells some very interesting war stories but that is about it.If you want to read about various women that the Lt. Col. has slept with over the years then this is the book for you. If on the other hand you want some information on the POW/MIA issue, you will have to search elsewhere."
1,Worst game ever!,"Do not buy this game. I bought it for my parents for Christmas, and it honestly ruined our Christmas Eve. The main obstacles in the game are controlled by the DVD remote, which is the worst possible tool to use for these games. They are basically impossible because they are designed so poorly. The phrase board game in the title should be put in paranthesis, since the board serves no actual function and is a complete waste. This game is horribly horrible in all facets, and I hope Pressman loses a monumental amount of money by producing this sham of a game since it is a complete rip-off. They have sullied the good name of 24 by putting this shiite out."
1,Not a walking video,"First of all, there is no walking in this video, so to have ""Walk"" in the title is a bit misleading. There are three toning segments that are about 20 minutes apiece, and there is no warm-up or stretching afterwards. With so many great toning videos out there, don't waste your money on this one."
1,Warning Please,Could Amazon please provide a warning? I heard about this show and it sounded interesting. It was disgusting and I had to turn it off part way and delete it because it got so bad. If you don't mind the filth you might enjoy the show as it did sound pretty interesting.
1,Dissapointment,"She's put out some good ones; this isn't one of em. That's just my humble opinion, but there just isn't anything new and at times the music seems so trite one would think it's Brittney Spears, not a talented artist like Ms. Streisand."
1,Very disappointed,"I don't recommend using this to clean your oven! Creates a real mess everywhere. And quite honestly didn't work very well anyway. I used elbow grease, and every other muscle I have, but it really did not do much. My oven wasn't even that dirty! Maybe it would work on smaller jobs, but as I used pretty much the whole tub and threw the rest away, I guess I'll never know. Guess it's back to the toxic spray stuff--at least it works. Very expensive mistake on my part."
1,Best Flash player IMO,"Best solid state player. Only 1GB but that's plenty. Excellent navigation lets you jump from playlist to playlist (sorted easily by creating directories, so no playlist creation necessary). Replaced by the Zen Nano this year."
1,DISGUST.,Those who liked this must either be lunatics or 8 year olds who never saw SW movies. The typical result of an idiotic trekkie woman trying to meddle with the star wars universe
1,"The bad, the bad, and the ugly","This game is terrible. I am not complaining about gameplay-it is terrible because I can NOT play it. First, the game does not recognize the keys of a USB gamepad. The pitching and hitting keys that work are different than showed in the documentation. Even when I figured out they keys, you are limited to simply throwing one pitch and swinging away. I can not believe 3DO could release a game and not test it with a USB port!! This makes the game unplayable. Second, Home Run Derby crashes in the middle and brings you back to your desktop. I could sit and list the problems I had once I FINALLY got a game going but I can summarize by saying-this is the worst game ever put out for the pc. This is not just a bad game, it is an unplayable bad game and my money has been wasted. I am so dissappointed because I finally upgraded my hardware enough to play the game people have raved about and it turns out to be junk."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS GUN,"DO NOT BUY THIS GUN AS U CAN see from the rest of the reviews it is really crapy in stead buy a ""cm.028"" its a ak47 full metal and 104$ i think i cant remember but the cm.028 has a hop up system full metal adjustable sights and ... well its a perfect gun and it even came with a sling and the gun is more the 300fps so DONT BUY THIS GUN BUY tHE ""CM.028"
1,Half-baked,"I'm surprised this book got such a favorable reception. I found it half-baked in every regard. The characters aren't very compelling. The central conceit of the book - that there is a contagious disease of some sort that produces bizzare deformities seemingly unique to each individual -- a tail, a talking mouth in a neck-- is rather puerile. Everyone seems to take this state of affairs in stride, for reasons that go unexplained, and they're more worried about getting laid even if it means contracting the disease. But nothing much happens - the story crawls along and then peters out. The black and white artwork is rather dull. I can't think of anything to recommend this book, actually."
1,"Bought and returned, before the baby came","We bought this item and everything looked fine. Then we attended a Baby CPR and Safety Class at our local hospital and learned that this product might be preventing SIDS, but itself constitutes a suffocation hazard!Even the American SIDS Institute says on their website (sids.org):""Place infants to sleep in a baby bed with a firm mattress. There should be nothing in the bed but the baby - no covering, no pillows, no bumper pads and no toys. Soft mattresses and heavy covering are associated with the risk for SIDS.""Please think, before you buy. Thank you!"
1,Pretentious and Boring,"The concept has everything for someone interested, as I am, in thrillers and mysteries with an intellectual twist. Sad to say, the execution of the concept lacks everything but the intellectual content. The writing is pretentious in the extreme, full of pseudo antiquarianisms. The characters are as thin as the paper the book is printed on. Basing some of them on famous people doesn't help a bit. Mystery plotting is lame and the climax is predictable. And, oh, does one have to wait for the end to come! This is one of the few books I have been tempted to heave across the room into the fireplace, if I had one."
1,"Hot, but I wish I could say the same for the music","First of all, the only ""Doll"" who even sings is Nicole. She isn't a great talent but her hottness and good beats cover it up. Most of the songs are just about sex mainly for the guys. If you are looking for something to play in a club, it would be great, but not good music"
1,Splice,"Splice totally sucks! I rented it as no way would i buy it, nor even want it if it was free... These 2 Biologists are making these blob like things and they create a thing which is sort of human..They keep the thing hidden and it matures into an adult..i suppose..The ending was weird too. The story was overall boring.."
1,Sue Grafton can do much better!,"I love all the Kinsey Milhone novels. I can't wait until the next one comes out. This one, however, didn't seem to be about Kinsey at all. It was pretty boring and I didn't feel the same ""at home"" feeling I usually get from her novels. I will read them all, but this one was my least favorite."
1,Someone should dump a hopper on this film...,Are you looking for:Bad Acting?Bad Paintball?Bad Direction?A hackneyed plot?Bad portrayal of the paintball world?Unrealistic action?Bad camera work?Poor dialogue?A waste of 90 minutes?Then THIS IS THE MOVIE FOR YOU! If you're a paintball fanatic - don't bother you'll be disappointed. If you're unfamiliar with the world of paintball and want to learn more - don't bother it's not going to help there either.
1,SOY and TOFU and a few other interesting recipes...,"My husband and I purchased this book for his father, as he had just had heart surgery, and we had seen Dr. Collins on Regis Live promoting his book. It sounded great and I thought this would be great for my father in law, as he loves to eat, and thought there would be great recipes for him. We were so motivated that We also purchased one for ourselves.If you love Soy and Tofu you have hit a gold mine...Well in our case, neither my husband and I, or my father in law happen to like either of these.Practically all the recipes need these ingredients. Except for a few ""creative"" ones. One of the being ""the carrot dog"". You just supplement a marinated carrot for a hot dog and place it on a hot dog bun!!!! YUK!!!In all due respect, Dr. Collins seems very dedicated to his patient's and if you are a Soy and Tofu lover, you will probally love these recipes and if not, don't buy it."
1,Glad that's over with,"If you have ever had that feeling after watching a movie, where you tell yourself,i cannot believe i watched the entire movie.That is how i felt after i completed reading this novel. I kept hoping the plot would improve, and it never did. I get the impression the authors struggled for material for this third edition. The focus of the story seemed disconnected at times from the true plot of Dune."
1,Semi-useful,"If you're familiar with the red flashing LED bicycle tailights seen on so many bikes these days, then you'll understand whan I say that this unit is essentially a one-LED version of those lights. Yes, it's visible from a good distance away, but only if you're directly behind it; the lens that focuses the light from the LED concentrates it over perhaps 10 degrees. The base has a magnet it it that will allow it to stand up on the roof of a car, assuming the roof is metal, which is still true for most cars. So as a road flare, it's better than nothing, but still nowhere near as visible as a traditional flare, or just putting on on your car's four-way emergency flashers.So what use it is? It might be useful as a rescue device, for signaling, or locating someone in the woods at night (if they had the presence of mind to bring it along with them). Given the low price, it might be worth experimenting with."
1,stopped working after 4 months,This product stopped working after 4 months. It connects just fine but won't charge the phone.
1,horrible camera,"We bought this camera for our daughter a year ago and have had nothing but misery since then. 99% of the pics come out with poor resolution. My husband and I have both tried to make it work better figuring user error on the part of our 15 yr old.... but alas no... the camera is just worthless. The lighting is never right. It is too bright so the pic is faded out or too dark so you can hardly see what you took a picture of. I often end up getting out my cell phone camera and taking a better pic and sending to an online place for printing with better results. It takes forever to take the pic so you sit there trying to hold the camera still enough with the pic often being blurry. Don't waste your money on this one, you'll regret it!"
1,rellenas de polvo blanco....,"Mi problema no es con las pastillas alli,es con la distribuidora Bargain OTC,que me mando capsulas llenas de yo no se que mugrrero,pero no eran las alli originales,porque yo tomo estas por mucho tiempo y las compro en Amazon y es la primera vez que no me trabajan y para comprobarlo fuy y compre unas ala farmacia y las abri y no tenian el mismo contenido las capsulas y estas si me empezaron a trabajar,solo cuidado con la compania,que escojan porque hay algunas que nos pueden matar."
1,Jumping on the bandwagon,I knew this was going to be a low budget independent production coming out of Australia. I got it because of the one cent price.. I figured what the heck.All I can say is that all of the reviews were spot on.. And the ending was just flat out illogical and dumb. You cannot cut up everybody into body parts.. without having at least one survivor. If you like murder and mahem try an episode of Dexter. DO NOT GO TO THE EXPENSE OF BUYING OR EVEN RENTING THIS DVD. You will be waisting your time. This will be especially true if you watch it.. as I hate to admit that I did.
1,Made my temperature rise!,"I bought this item thinking it would be the perfect indoor outdoor thermometer, but I was way off! First, it would not recognize the remote temp at all. After trying several batteries and pushing the reset buttons they did find each other. One night outside though and again, it was lost. It seems the two could not be more than 15 or 20 feet apart or they did not share the signals. Even then, it was hit or miss. I was truly dissappointed and sent it back for a refund. Too bad they don't pay for the shipping, so I lost money and got my temperature up! Don't waste your time on such electronic thermometer devices if you live in a snowy cold area like we do. The batteries will not last outside in the cold and you too will be the only thing heating up! I hope this was helpful."
1,Can we say sucks?,"I bought this last year with my birthday money, WHAT A MISTAKE!! The bateries rarley last more than 10 minutes due to the large screen. Will die with the lens out. Pictures rarley come out clear. I want to sell it so bad. I hate it!"
1,Find something else,"I accidentally came across this mic while browsing and thought, hey, I've got one like this! So just to tell you guys - don't waste your money on it, so funny that it simply doesn't pic up sound, any mic is better - your webcam's, your laptop's. And I thought Sony couldn't go wrong, lol. Cheers."
1,Inability to handle numerous proteins,"I switched my two boston terriers (one is 16 pounds and the other is 24 pounds) to Chicken Soup over a 10 day period. I noticed they had considerable gas, but assumed it was a temporary condition from switching to a new food. Once they were only on the Chicken Soup, they had diarrhea, black and tarry stools. I immediately switched them back to Science Diet. I contacted the company and asked if they knew what could have casued this digestive upset - they responded that the numerous protein sources were probably the cause. So maybe boston terriers don't do well with this type of premium dog food. I would recommend you purchase a small bag first, in case it doesn't work out."
1,Not Original Recordings,"The cover of the CD shows an early Hank Thompson all dressed up in his western gear. However, these ""20 Greatest Hits"" were recorded at the Gusto/King studios in 1979. Although they sound great, I would have preferred the original recordings. This should have been mentioned in the product description."
1,Written in Computer Geek,"I admit it: I'm as much a computer geek as the next person. Well, maybe a tad more. But this novel, written about how a computer bug affects the life of its originator, wore me down. It is boring, dull, uninteresting, and plodding. It was written in how I would imagine a typical computer geek would write: every small, insignificant detail described to the nth degree, and then some! This probably would have been more interesting if the author wrote the entire novel in C++."
1,What Happenend???????,I really wanted to like this album but this is horrible. To begin with the lyrics go into three directions.....1.Boy do mainstream punk rock bands suck(duh!!) 2.I sure do I like p-u-s-s-y(duh!!) 3.Censorship is bad for us all(duh!!!!!!!!) The latter being the only bit of substance on the record. As far as the music goes there are a couple of highlights but so few to even mention. The songwriting is so bad it sounds like this is a band that just started playing last week........sorry guys. The mixing of the record is terrible. If you really want to get into Hed P.E. pick up their self-titled or Broke.
1,Terrible service by skylink,"First I purchased the Skylink Transmitter G6MR since it was ""100%"" compatible with my Overhead Door Company opener. It IS NOT. I was told by skylink support to go by a 12 volt adapter for the receiver or get the model 69N that would work with my current Model 100A receiver.So, I returned the G6MR and ordered the 69N and guess what. It is not compatible with the U100! According to the first support tech it is, but the second one says they mad a mistake. So I have to make another return to amazon and buy a model 66C!Just not worth all the aggravation.David"
1,Not what pictured,"This ball looks like a full size medicine ball, but it is actually something you can hold with one hand. WAY too small."
1,Linda,Cute kid but inappropriate language mostly from father. I was showing it to 8 year olds and felt embarrassed for their parents to hear their reviews.
1,what has happened to the novel?,"Simply put, this novel stunk. The language is imprecise, the characters boring and unlikeable, and the situations stupid. It's tedious, rambling, unreadable verbal muck. It'd be easier and less painful to get it into your brain by ramming it through your ear rather than reading it. You'd be more entertained watching hair grow."
1,This is not music!,"I am a music arts major at Cal Poly and I have never heard a CD this poor. Michael Jackson's overdubs over ""peaceful"" nature sounds is one of the most unrelaxing things I have ever experienced. Do not buy this. It's utter crap."
1,Simply bland...,"Many wonderful and creative rave reviews on this cd, however the music doesn't measure up to the reviews. Technically speaking Clark seems to be a decent enough pianist, however his style is not distictive, in other words he sounds liek any other painist you would hear in a hotel cocktail lounge. Maybe with time and maturity this artist might aspire to be a great piasist he just needs to spread his wings and try other tings, and maybe he won't sound so dull. Until then, skip this one. I give it two stars for effort, and there's no doubt that the man has talent, he's just hasn't found a creative way to present it to us in the cd forman as of yet.Bottom line: This cd should be retitled ""SIMPLY BLAND."""
1,Disappointed,This is not a soundtrack. It is a score of background music from the movie. Very disappointed and not worth it. There are only 2 actual songs. What a great movie could have done a better soundtrack....especially for us BRIDES :) Save your money for the wedding girls!!
1,My cat just wouldn't use it,"The very first time I tried, my cat stepped on it and almost fell into the toilet. My cat is a pretty big cat and the CitiKitty thing is just not strong enough. After that my cat wouldn't get close to CitiKitty and would just defecate in the bathtub.I switched back to the litter box."
1,"Skip this ""Portrait""","Although the Cambridge singers always perform beautifully, this is not a beautiful album. The selections vary from sacred to secular, from a capella to full orchestral accompaniment--so it's hard to sit and listen to this as a program of music. The sound quality sounds like someone pushed the ""reverb"" button on an old electric guitar amplifier. If you're looking for a Cambridge Singers album, I'd start with ""Hail Gladdening Light"" ASIN B0000031HJ, and then go on to ""Faire is the Heaven"" ASIN B0000031H7 by the same forces. Both are collections of English Church music that are more even and are programmed more logically."
1,Comfortable but color not what was expected,I ordered a brown cap but the color looked more faded when I actually got the item in the mail.
1,"Fantasia was prettier, Beatles cartoon funnier","This is 90 minutes of slooow computer graphics, mingled pretentiously with montages of wax-museum faces, bits of advertising of all eras, still photos of abandoned buildings and of course The Mushroom Cloud! ""Full of sound and fury, signifying nothing."" I have liked much of the music from Phillip Glass's operas; that's why I bought this disk. I have to say, the visuals here succeed in making Glass's score sound melodramatic, trite, and vapid."
1,Displeased,"I should've taken the time to read the reviews on this because I would have been aware of the disreputable product this seems to be. The footage is grainy and what's worse is there's no narration, therefore making it difficult to recognize much of what is being viewed. Also, the running time of the video is a disappointment, it is incompatible with the asking price.Very poor product. NOT RECOMMENDED!!"
1,"Worked great, then...","When this was working, it was 5 stars. Worked great. But after about 12 months the strap on the watch just broke. And they don't make it easy to get a replacement, either, from what I can find"
1,Cute if you're not expecting much.,"If you're a horse lover then you will like this story. It's a fun, unchallenging read, however, it's contrived, cliche, and Miss Leland has no confidence whatsoever in her reader's intelligence. Everything is pointed out to you, ""She smiled because she was so happy,"" etc. The plot leaves something to be desired as well as most of the book is Beth and Conner ""Brett"" Hall, continually rehashing how much they like eachother and want to have sex with one another, with little else going on except the random accidents that are supposed to suffice as plot twists. Personally, I'm tired of equestrian fiction being held to a lower standard of writing than the basest high school novel. The Saddle Club has more interesting story lines than this book."
1,COUNTERFEIT PRODUCT WHEN PURCHASED FROM CEON GROUP!,"Hi, This product is **fraudulent**. I own another genuine CLOUD B turtle(purchased directly from amazon) with which I am thrilled, so i purchased this one as a gift. this one is a completeely inferior poor quality counterfeit, with no tag and/or manufacturer information at all. And this is a product for **babies!!** God knows what else is in there (lead? cadmium?, defective batteries leaking acid?) I am a frequent amazon customer, generally very satisfied w/the experience. This is the first time I've had this sort of issue. Really freaked out by it."
1,last of the dogmen (region 2 ),i don't believe region 2 in the title is a fair explanation. the d v d will not play on a standard player !
1,"Well, maybe 2 and a half stars.","Detail = excellent . . . Characters = disappointing . . . Prose = so so . . . Plot = overdone . . . Love scenes = were there any? Did I miss them?The love story between Nathaniel and Alexandra got lost in the midst of all the plot. So many things happened to these two that it was almost ridiculous. A very dark and depressing book. I didn't leave with a feeling that these two were meant for each other, that they _had_ to be together. This one goes to the UBS."
1,I dont like this knife,"I took this knife to the boundary waters in 2010 and 2011. It is not a good knife. I regret not buying something with better quality. I used it on Pike and Crappie. The knife worked fine on the Crappie, but it was terrible on Pike. PIKE are slimey and the knife handle does not have any grip. I cut myself twice. Also the knife is not very flezible for removing skin. I let others use it and they did not like it either. I do love my Gerber hatchet though. That is a tough mother!!"
1,Not THIS Time!!!!,"I have bought the original DVD, The extended DVD. Why do I need to buy this? Why? WHY? WHY?"
1,"Oh, please!","This was one of the sorriest things I've read in a long time. The author crammed every cliche of the 20th century into each tiresome, poorly written page. I could almost anticipate the dialogue before reading what a semi-talented 8th grader could have written. The author clearly is capitalizing on the popularity of book clubs, and I would not have read this if it hadn't been my own book club's selection. Please, don't bother reading this fluff."
1,Battle not to crash,What a waste of my time and money. I should have read other reveiws on this prodect before buying it. The game crashes all the time - everytime. The only thing I can say good about it is I got a jewel case and a pretty box. If there is anyone interested in this game give my a buzz.
1,How can this be a thriller? Never watch it.,"OK..Alfred Htchcock is a great director but if he makes this movie...Sorry ..I am not seeing any of his movies. storyline is neither romantic nor a thriller. The killer is pretty obvious and in the end so much for the thrill, his intentions nor the plot are even mentioned once. Damn ....what a waste."
1,IR 212 3/8 Impact,"Having used IR air tools for many years and having gotten very good service out of them, when it was time to replace my old IR 3/8 drive impact I of course bought another IR. Sorry to say that I should have looked at the CP's. My 25 year old IR 3/8 gun has almost as much power as this one and the quality of the tool is just not there like it once was. Also was very disappointed but not surprised to see that it is made in China. Would have gladly paid more for the old time IR quality and power. Think I'll see if I can find a rebuild kit for my old IR. By the way I repair heavy equipment and trucks so I use all of my air tools a lot every day every day, everything from 1/4"" drive air ratchet to my 1' drive impact all older IR's."
1,Well written psychobabble,"Was raised on her stuff and even as a young person being confused in the world I could see this woman was far more confused than I was. Rape and inflicted pain on each other as lust and love? Not my idea of appropriate ways to show ""love"". Selfishness as the epitome of human existence? I disgree. Give me Gandhi please."
1,I wish it were better,"The only reason this gets 2 stars is because its a little better than the first version but not by much. Maps are terrible, char guides are bad, inconsistent and wrong, online information is easier to find and use. Mob info is sparse and usless, drop info is just a print out. Sorry I want this to be a good book but its not. If you are totally new to the game you may feel that this is a good companion to your gaming however if you have any char > lvl 40 its kinna useless."
1,"The third, and worst, of the projects","Easily the worst of the Jazzmatazz projects. Doesn't even really sound like Jazz at all, anywhere. It's more an R&B Neo-soul project.Now if you're into that kind of thing, it's probably a good album. I found a few songs to be good but overall it's just too much of a departure from the whole concept of Jazz-meets-HipHop for me."
1,Eh...,Music is highly personal... so you might love this album. I thought it was kind of eh. God Monkey Robot is good and worth $0.89. ;)
1,What next,"As I tried keeping up with the images and story line, I felt it effecting me like a bad LSD trip. I am not sure what I was supposed to learn from these latest adventures into Wonderland but I will say this was the least entertaining of the series. I think that this type of Shamanism may be running out of gas."
1,bad sizing,the top part of these were huge while the legs were very tight. I very much prefer the REI brand for correct sizing all around. These are silk and yes they are 3x but I would rather spend the same money elsewhere
1,"Could be better, much better!","I was really hoping this book would be THE E2K BOOK! I was wrong: poorly written, really weird chapter structure (actual installation of E2K is reviewed in Chapter 6!!), thoughts are not clearly expressed and important details are missed out. Will work as a quick reference (partly) but you will want to buy at least another book on the subject. Too bad tech-for-tech approach didn't work this time. I'll wait until O'Reily comes up with one."
1,could have been something better,"I was very excited to listen to this when I purchased it. Although the show got mixed reviews I was pretty sure I would enjoy it because it had Adam Pascal (RENT) and Heather Headley (Lion King) in it. Plus, I loved Elton John's songs in the Lion King. Sad to say, this CD isn't very great. The music Elton John wrote for this is uninspring. It lacks any kind of showstopping tunes and and the songs really don't further the story. It listens more like a regular album with each track as a new pop song. Pascal and Headley have great voices and you can hear why Headley won her recent Tony award. Sherie Renee Scott is completely wasted in the show. She has a great voice but doesn't get good material to work with.Overall, this could have been a great show and Elton John could have written something a lot better."
1,Poor quality - quickly die out on you,"I looked forward to getting Energizer-branded batteries for my Nikon camera, so I bought three of these batteries. But, they aren't Energizer. They're made by a company called Technuity and are licensed under the Energizer brand.After a few uses, they quickly died out either refusing to take a charge, or taking a charge but running dead within minutes of starting to use them. If you want a quality battery, find one made by Nikon."
1,I found the c.d. quite frankly boring!,"This is one of the worst c.d.s I have ever reviewed. We appeciate Barbra's new-found spirituality, but it just doesn't come across in the delivery. She sounds tired and straining in most of the songs and the background choir over-powers her voice. The one saving grace is the collaboration with Celine Dion, with Dion's enormous popularity putting the album on the charts.Be it known that Barbra's decision to include the song ""Tell Him"" was based on potential sales of the Celine Dion name."
1,Among the worst kits I have attempted to put together,"Typical AMT fit and finish. Hardly any of the parts fit correctly. There is flash everywhere. The door seams on the driver side is too shallow, so you have to take a knife and make it deeper. This kit is bad even for AMT/ERTL."
1,Junk,"This item is made so cheap had I known it, I wouldnt have even considered it.Walmart sells one for the same price and is made much more durable."
1,unhappy,"never received the product. Very disappointed. No response from email, but my credit card was charged. Very unhappy with site and service."
1,Pulp Fiction for thumpers.,"If your eye offends thee pluck it out. something like that. After the first ten minutes i wanted to dig my eyes out. compleat trash. People/ parents/ schools/ churches that took their kids to see this horror show should have been arrested for child abuse. Even the film ""Blood sucking Freaks"" was not this big of a torture show. Do yourself a favor. Rent ""JC Superstar "" and ""Godspell."""
1,What happened to the fun Bridgerton boys?,"I have to say that this is probably my least favorite Bridgerton books. It lacked what all her other books had. He was not as witty and charming as his other brothers............i did not want to finish this book, i just did because i knew that this will be the last with this family."
1,Dry Reading,"I bought this book for a class that I may take at a seminary. I have read nearly half the book. For me, this book is boring. The writer spends too much time in the details. There are a lot of new words, people name's and their books. So far, there is one page that I found interesting. That was in the notes on the bottom of a page concerning the pluralism of Islam stated by Baxter. Page 95. The writer constantly says that he needs to discuss the background on various subjects, but does a poor job relating it to the present. Maybe it will get better during the last half of the book. I will finish reading this book, but I do not recommend the book."
1,WARNING: CONTAINS 63 -73% GRAIN ALCOHOL!!!,"It says it nowhere in the description but the first ingredient listed for this product is grain alcohol, then distilled water, then turmeric extractives. On the bottle it lists 63-73% grain alcohol.Grain alcohol is a form of pure alcohol which has been produced by fermenting and distilling grain. It is also known as ethyl alcohol or ethanol. In addition to being used in the production of alcoholic beverages, grain alcohol is also used as a solvent and in a variety of other industrial applications. Because grain alcohol is extremely potent, it should not be consumed straight, and people should never consume other alcohols such as methyl alcohol, because these substances are very toxic."
1,Beware Turbo Tax no longer works with Windows 98 and ME,Beware Turbo Tax no longer works with Windows 98 and ME. Quite a few people will be surprised when the load the CD. The Turbo Tax solution is to use the online version. I was unable to transfer prior year information following printed instructions and an e-mail from support. Support suggested my browser was the problem and suggested that I replace it with Mozzilla. I do use Mozzilla and the data won't transfer. I realy like last years desktop version.
1,Billy Elliott - The Movie,"Bought this video as a gift for my 10 year old boy, who is a dancer.Had heard good things about the Theatrical Version sothought would see the video.Heavy British Accents and lots of profanity notsuited for a young child..."
1,Bad language,"There's a lot of bad language and name-calling in this film. We watched a few minutes of it and then canned it. It was a gift, but too bad. We work really hard to teach our children to behave well and treat others with respect, so I don't want their entertainment to teach them otherwise."
1,S.BURLEY'S REVIEW,"AS A TRUE FAN OF EVANS WORK WITH A COLLECTION OF 30 PLUS ALBUMSFEATURING THE GREAT PIANIST AS LEADER OR SIDEMAN I WAS RATHER DISAPPOINTED IN THIS RELEASE. THE THING THAT STRIKES ME FIRST ABOUT THIS ALBUM IS HOW AWFUL THE PIANO AND DRUMS ARE RECORDED(THE WORST SOUND QUALITY OF ANY EVANS STUDIO DATE I'VE HEARD ).THE MUSIC IS FAR FROM ESSENTIAL. NONE OF THE SONGS STAND OUT IN PARTICULAR. THE RUNNING TIME OF THE ALBUM IS UNDER 34 MINUTES.IF YOU'RE IN SEARCH OF AN OBSCURE GEM AS I WAS,YOU SHOULD PASS ON THIS ONE."
1,misleading lamp NOT a floor lamp or Full spectrum,This is a floor lamp??!!(perhaps for a 3 year old...read the dimensions which I did not thinking a floor lamp would be for reading especially since it claims to be a full spectrm lamp. It does not fit on a table & on the floor it looks ridiculious. It claim to have a full spectrum light which it did not include( it must be 20 watt full spectrum which stores only carry 27 watt so one must order from the lamp company) & it claim to have a floor off & on switch which it does not!! This is the first product I have EVER been disappointed in from Amazon...I make a point to mainly order from them directly & not from other companies they represent because I think they have great quality control...this one got pass them!! I would rate this a minus star!!TENSOR FULL SPECTRUM FLOOR LAMP
1,viola,"Product arrived in good condition, but according to the school music teacher the bridge will have to be shortened and also the sound post will have to be repositioned. I will have to take this to the music shop to get this fixed. It will probably cost me more than the price of the instrument itself"
1,"Talk, talk, talk, but goes no where","If you like 'day in the life' movies, it's good. But for me, I hate it when all the dialog in a movie goes no where. I did love the characters but when all they do is talk through the entire movie about nothing, I kept hoping it would get better."
1,Photo Paper Review,"Four of the six packets (100 sheets) of 4"" X 6"" HP Photo paper contained paper that was longer than six inches, by about a half inch. Very useless for my purpose, since to use the paper I will need to have each of the four odd packets trimmed so that the sheets can be fed then from either direction."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,"I RECEIVED AS A GIFT WHEN I USED TWICE WITH MY BABY THE SHOWER DIDN'T WORK, I EXCHANGE FOR A NEW ONE AND HAPPENED THE SAME ON THE SECOND TIME OF USED.I RETURNED THE PRODUCT AND BUY ANOTHER BATH TUBE.THEY HAS A NICE PRESENTATION BUT IS A TERRIBLE BATH SHOWER"
1,Blink . . . o blink,"Sellin out isnt always cool, but blink did on this album. At first, i defended their butts, but now it shows through. Blink is a great band with wonderful talent. But they didnt have to change their music just to make people like them.Go out and buy Chesire Cat and Dude Ranch. ull see how they changed. Blink is still the best but they need ""time to sow all the bridges that they burned"""
1,Beautiful but Strange,"The pictures in this book are lovely, and it's well put together, but the information in it is even more fruit-loopey than most fairy books, and she has a strange view of light vs. dark. I found it slightly disturbing and wasn't expecting it in this book."
1,Buyer Beware,"This multifunction device did not print or scan at all when used in conjunction with my IBM NetVista computer. The problem probably relates to the USB connection (my computer only has USB ports - no parallel port) and may have something to do with Windows ME, as well. So if you have an all-USB computer and are running Windows ME, you have been forewarned. I was extremely disappointed with Xerox customer service, also. They just blamed the whole problem on Microsoft and IBM and basically couldn't have cared less about my predicament."
1,I can't believe what you guys are saying,"I bought this DVD after reading your stupid reviews. So, you guys think this is a great show, huh?I can't believe it. I really admired the actors on the show... they did great job. Without them, I could give this DVD 0 star if I could. All the actors are great .....except one.... The Latino guy trying to look like Antonio Banderas... Every character is annoyingly stupid and reckless. No wonder it was canceled after only one season. I got 1 more episode to see now... the only reason that I'm still watching is I want to make sure that all these stupid people are dead as they are supposed to be."
1,Horrifyingly bad,"This version is unchanged from the release a couple of years ago by Interactive Magic, except to make it more Windows Me friendly. The game itself is repetitive and boring. After 90 minutes, you will have seen all there is to see and be frustrated by the sameness of everything. I love the subject matter this game is about; if you do, too, I recommend trying to find Transport Tycoon, Capitalism Plus, or even Railroad Tycoon II."
1,Biased Ivy League reviews,"This is a decent guide for the most part. The trouble is that the authors' biases are clear when they review Yale's ""rival"" schools. Is anyone surprised that this book makes Yale out to be the flawless shining star of the Ivy League and Harvard, Princeton, et al. to be overrated, filled with unhappy students, etc.? The not-so-subtle advertising compromises the book's integrity where the Ivy League is concerned. If those are the schools that interest you, Fiske and Princeton Review are better bets."
1,Still Holding Out For A Boxed Set,"I just want to say thank-you for that review. Ever since I bought the three Quack Pack tapes about a year or two ago, I have been anxiously waiting for the series to come out on DVD (I missed this cartoon when it originally aired.)Seeing as how there are only three episodes on this first volume, I think I will go ahead and either continue to wait for a more comprehensive set or just try to catch them the next time they air on Toon Disney and burn them to DVD myself for my own personal collection.Still, I could eventually buy this DVD if I find it cheap enough locally, since I don't yet have these three episodes. But, it is not a high priority for me now."
1,Plagiarism?,"This book is worthless. All the author did was take other peoples work, which are based on falsehood, and pass it off as his own. Save your money and look for a factual book on Nathan Bedford Forrest."
1,"Too much Harriet, too little help","For someone running a small business or thinking of starting one, emotional strength can prove as important as a business plan. Harriet Rubin is on to a great topic here, but she ruins the book by her staggering self-indulgence, name dropping and bragging about how much money she makes. Someone who wants insight into what being in business for yourself is really like would do better with Spare Room Tycoon, by James Chan. That book has the advantage of drawing on the experience of dozens of other entrepreneurs, and it's better written besides."
1,For Gluten Free bread - a NO go!,"I've never had a problem with bread machines - I got this one because of the gluten-free setting which we recently needed. I've tried two separate bread recipes and both were a flop. One, the crust was very hard and the inside not done. Gluten breads need a lot of care when mixing and assembling and I just can't see a bread machine handling it."
1,"Don't buy from Eforcity -- slow, disingenuous","What am I reviewing here... this gizmo or the supplier, Eforcity? I never received this product after my order! After waiting and waiting I contacted Eforcity several times -- no reply. After a nasty letter from me Eforcity'r reply feigned lacking information about my mailing address!What a cop-out.I told them I would not pay for it, so Eforcity said they'd give me a refund, which has not come to me yet. I bought another product to replace this from Amazon which arrived quickly from Amazon."
1,One more vote,"Just helping to bring down the average on reviews. Shame on you New Line, we are not as stupid as you thought, hope you lose lots of cash on this blunder. On second thought if they lose money, they will just increase the cost of the extended version. Either way the consumer is screwed again!!"
1,waste of money,thought this product was a waste of $15 and i am embarassed i put it on my new mercedes. left it with all still spotty marks and gross.
1,have not received,"this is terrible service...I ordered this product 1/29/07 and it hasn't arrived to date 02/12/07...I receive books via media mail in 3-5 days, can't believe the product isn't here...probably won't order from this person or Amazon again with this kind of service."
1,"product ok, company terrible",Took 4 months to receive lamp when ordered from company. Lamp broke after 2 months. Took 2 more months to receive replacement and then without the bulb. Still battling with them. My advise is to buy from a more reliable company.
1,Disappointed,"DisappointedI purchased the level, removed it from the box, and tried it out around the house. One of the pushbuttons didn't work the first 10 times I tried it. I was just about to box it up and send it back but it started to work. I should have gone with my first instinct, return it. After trying to use it to lay out a garage, 30 days later, my thought on the level is it doesn't work very well. The repeatability is poor. It is too dim to use outside, unless it is dusk. It was too late for me to return the item, I had throw away the original cardboard cover and had keep it for 30 days, otherwise I would send it back."
1,Great while it lasts,The unit is great as long as it lasts. My egg poacher lasted for around 6 months and the toaster 6 months past that. Unfortunately no other company makes a comparable product. There are two other brands but both are owned by Back to Basics. I will buy a new one and hope that a company that has a quality control department starts putting out a similar product before this unit craps out as it appears is standard.
1,TRASH!,Duh...now even those who failed at their high school English courses are being published. Why not read Germaine Greer's new book instead of this trash?
1,"Polemics, not scholarship.","To reach her spurious conclusions, the author presents decades-old data on men and housework as if these studies came out last week. Credible research from the University of Michigan shows that men and women work about the same amount of time when you include both work done inside and outside the home. Ladies, if you want to read a great book that will help you earn more money, read ""Why men earn more"" by Warren Farrell. Studies show that the claims of feminism are questionable at best, and at worst misleading and damaging to women and all who earnestly seek the truth. ""The second shift"" is part of the backlash against equality that has been gradually building up steam in western culture since the Renaissance."
1,The brush received was not what is pictured,"The brush received was the properly stated size, but the larger brush at the rear was (dark metallic brush at back). I purchased this brush solely to have the larger rear portion to clean a particular piece, and already had a normal brush this size. Now I have two brushes, and not what I was looking for"
1,boring compared to my bloody life.,"i knew this book was going to be a little less ""in your face"" because its about him trying stay out of trouble but man was this book boring compared to the first book.I don't know if its because i read my bloody life a year before once a king always a king and maybe my taste has changed since the first book or if it really was boring but man did this one bore me."
1,Overrated,The songs actually played during the show seemed much better than what was on this album. Maybe the next season's soundtrack will be better????
1,Don't waste your money.,"The songs on this album are great songs, but the sound quality is DIPLORABLE!!! What a DISAPPOINTMENT. I really like Josephine's style and voice, but you can barely make out the words on this muffled slurred CD. It's like looking at a beautiful piece of art thats blurry. I am assuming that all the records in the ""Cocktail Hour"" series are just as bad judging from the reviews I've seen. Too bad I didn't do my research before making this purchase. My advice to other customers...look for the same songs elsewhere. Don't waste your money on this."
1,denlan,"Is somebody can explain how this music is worth rating more than 1 star.All the songs sound the same, sleepy and booring.The voice is flat and the piano far from jazz music. This music is no jazz, it's depressed lounge music."
1,Horrible Boring Piece Of Crap,"This isn't inventive or creative filmaking. It's just the ramblings of someone who thinks he's exposing ""the truth"". His truth happens to be the demented product of his own delusional mind. If you enjoy this, you probably believe in every conspiracy theory that shows up on the internet. How about living in the real world for a change? Beyond that...it's just a bore."
1,Leave it at home,"I took this guide book as well as the Lonely Planet toTunisa for a month. I could have easily gotten along with just the Planet, and it's smaller to lug around. The Rough Guide was often either vague, or the information was so wrong that I got the impression that some of the places written about were never actually visited by the writter. Directions were hard to follow and the layout of information was not nearly as concise as the Planet Guide. I was tempted to ditch this book many times along the way as it really wasn't worth the space it took up in my pack."
1,MASE IS THE WORST RAPPER,"Mase is wak, never buy his albums, BONE THUGS N HARMONY are the best. JAY Z IS WAK"
1,"Am I expecting too much? Nope, not at all","Cliche, ripoff, no use of the word said, it's all been said why this book is crap.All right, there's lots of cliched pulp fantasy out there, but at least these mediocre books accept what they are. If you'll check out Paolini's website, you'll see the arrogance he's developed from writing a mediocre pulp fantasy book that thinks it's going to be a classic."
1,Can I have the last four hours of my life back?,"Talk about a huge waste of time. There are basically two separate plots in the book: one involving a ghost haunting an FBI agent and another where the same FBI agent is investigating the death of a Supreme Court Justice. The only connecting thread between the two loosely woven plots was that the same FBI agent was working on both cases. That's it. The title of the book has no bearing whatsover on the main focus of the book - the Justice's murder. The ""blow out"" refers to the ghostly plot, which in fact, is miniscule both in scale and importance to the entire book. The respective endings of both plots were so unbelievably anti-climatic, I kept turning pages just to see if there really was ""more."" There wasn't. This is the first and last book I'll ever read by this author. Although it was a very quick read, I still feel like it was a waste of an afternoon."
1,PLEASE READ !,"I purchased this book while on vacation as it looked like a good book to read at the beach. The book reviews on the 1st couple of pages looked great but ...I am sorry I did not open it and read a few pages. It is a book that is full of extremely bad language ...#%*#...not my style. It is not well done. I am tired of authors and movie directors who think the average guy on the street wants this kind of trash...To make matters worse the author teaches college literature. He should know better. this is not literature...pure trash. The College of the Atlantic in Maine can do much better. I cannot believe I am the 1st person to give this book the review it deserves. I would have given it 0 stars if this were an option...If a book full of 4 letter words is your style, go for it. But when your kids start to talk this way- don't blame their friends. I am taking a stand and burning this book instead of trading it at a used book store."
1,I have 3 words for ya: This game stinks,"Out of all the fighting games I played, this was the worst of them all. The controls are waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay too easy. I like games with at least a little bit of blood and dying. I got tired of this after a few weeks. I usually get tired after 4 or 5 months. If you want a good fighting game, get Tekken, Mortal Kombat, Soul Calibur, or twisted Metal.( no, I don't work for any of these. I just turned 12 yesterday.)"
1,didn't make it through 1 fuel canister,"It seemed like a great start. I got this stove to replace my Coleman that stopped making the Coleman Powermax fuel. I like the remote canister, and it tested fine at home. But on my vacation to California, it didn't even make it through 1 canister of fuel before it gave up. Only used half the canister before it slowed to a stop. Even upside down, it wouldn't go for long. It wasn't even cold, as I was in the Joshua Tree desert. I guess MSR knew that the product is flawed, as they came out with a Windpro II since then that is designed to be used with the fuel upside down. I returned the Windpro and picked up a Windpro II, hoping for better results. Still need to test it in the field, but have less confidence now...."
1,What's the fuss,"I suppose you shouldn't expect too much for an inexpensive jar of preserved truffle. But it really failed to add anything to the foods we tried it with: eggs, soup. These aren't worth the hype. I once ate at Truffles in Chicago. Now that was an experience. I guess you have to have fresh truffles to capture their essence."
1,Wrong item,"I ordered a ""U.S.ARMY"" flag. I received a ""U.S.AIR FORCE"" flag. Gave it to my neighbor who is retired Air Force, and didn't try again."
1,My Grocery List Is More Interesting Read,"I just can't believe that John Grisham is a major player in current fiction scene and is considered to be in the same league with Tom Clancy and Stephen King (though I don't like horror stories at all but at least SK knows how to form a sentence).I have read all JG's books and the only ones I enjoyed were ""The Chamber "" and ""The Rainmaker"". His worst book ever, to me, was ""The Partner"" and the ""Street Lawyer"" could be a hot contender for that position had it not been for the subject which I found thought provoking (that's why 2 stars). It seems that JG has run out of ideas (which were never abundant to him in the first place) but his books are at least serving one purpose i.e. we have one less lawyer to worry about.Sorry Mr. Grisham, but from now-onwards, you are on my ""borrow only"" authors list.Rafi"
1,Don't bother,"When I saw this movie on t.v. I loved it so much. I bought this DVD with the same expectations as the original. Boy was I wrong. I can't believe they cut out half of this movie. If someone wants to throw money in the street like I did, then get this movie. Please don't waste your money or time on this."
1,Ugh ...,"This album is a compilation of nauseating lyrics and beats. Justin's voice gets annoying after the third song, and the lyrics are incredibly horrible. The only ""good"" songs on this album are the ballads, and a few of the slower tempo songs. ""Digital Getdown"" and ""It Makes Me Ill"" and ""Just Got Paid"" are really horrible, horrible songs.The best songs on this album have all been released as singles, so save your money and tape them off the radio."
1,Entertaining,"I love comparing and hearing the sounds of different languages, and this product has definitely given me much enjoyment. You can probably learn some good phrases and vocabulary, but as other reviewers have already said, this is more of a sampler, than a serious language product. To go deeper, go elsewhere.The pronunciation feature, where you speak into the microphone and have your pronunciation judged against a native speaker, looks cool, but it's useless. It took me awhile to figure that out, but for fun I tried speaking Japanese like Goober of Mayberry and got a much better rating than when I tried to sound authentic. I promise I'm telling the truth here."
1,"not very ""screaming"" at all","Bruce Campbell, superstar? Not with movies like this. OK, so he's a cult figure and all, but there's nothing particularly redeeming at all about this movie and Ted Raimi is much more interesting. An American diplomat (played by Campbell) is accidentally killed and dragged back to the lair of a mad scientist who transplants the brain of a taxi driver into him and voila, that's about it, and of course stupid behavior ensues. I bought this with the highest expectations, and after I watched it only loaned it to a friend who watched it and also thought it was pretty lame, and then traded it in. As I mentioned Ted Raimi pretty much steals the show, as the Russian assistant of the mad scientist (as played by Stacy Keach, who must be hard up for money) and Raimi is the best thing this has going as he does his Russian hip-hop patter. Other than that, this is a bust, bleah."
1,Inappropriate Illustrations,"I felt that some of the illustrations in this book were too advanced for my 11-year-old. ""Almost 12"" would lead me to believe that it is geared towards ten and eleven year olds. I don't think an 11-year-old needs to see an illustration of a woman giving birth!"
1,"Slow, confusing, distasteful",I couldn't get into this book at all. I have read a lot of the Oprah Book Club books. This was totally different from any of those. Most of the books she chooses has a lesson to learn. This book did not. I do not recommend this book at all.
1,Major Problems with design,"I have purchased 2 of these. I love the concept and functionality, but after having the second one quit on me shortly after purchasing it. I disassembled both ratchets only to find the same issue. The magnets in the motors ended up in little pieces. I did not drop them to cause this or abuse them in any way. So, I went to Skil website to get parts and everything for this ratchet has been discontinued. Skil really dropped the ball on this one, I would rather pay a bit more and have a quality tool. I have a lot of Skil tools but in the future I probably will not purchase any more from them or their Bosch counterpart only because of the way they have dealt with this ratchet. A good company would have recalled them or at least replaced their defective motors."
1,Beware!,"Be careful with this product. There are a number of problems present in the current model of the 30"" ACD.The most notable one is the famous 'pixel-dancing' or flickering problem. You can read all about it in the following Apple discussion thread:[...]Scroll down to the end and you'll see that this problem is still very much present in these displays.I'm now going for my second replacement since I purchased the original display, and I hope I get a decent display this time. It seems to be a hit or miss situation, I'm afraid.Despite this, however, if you do receive one of the good displays, you'll absolutely love it. Just make sure you buy it from somewhere you can obtain a replacement and, in the worst of cases, a refund."
1,"Great stories, not great directions","The book doesn't have great directions for actually getting to the towns. The stories are ok though, pics are fine too."
1,Not for dieting,"Beautiful design, well made, made to last. But these bowls are way too big. I put one serving of cereal in one of these bowls and it was like ""that's it??!?!"" Makes servings look like you're trying to feed a bird. So if you assume portion size by looks alone you'll be disappointed. I would recommend this bowl as a salad bowl but not for cereal or soup unless you like to eat.. alot. These bowls do not fit in my dishwasher very well. If you microwave anything in these, be careful!! the bowl gets very hot as it absorbs the heat. Great and colorful but not practical."
1,bad phone,I came online to amazon.com to search for a new better phone and came accross this one. I already have it and it is the worst phone i have ever had. i've had it for about almost three years and i shouldn't have even kept it that long. The battery life is EXTREMELY short. i talk on the phone a lot and i cut almost all of my conversations short beacause the phone needs to be charged. BUYERS BEWARE!!!
1,"Works ok, tastes terrible!","I thought that the new gu would taste like the old stuff but it has a pungent taste! It works ok, but the taste makes me gag. I'd recommend saving your money and sticking with the original gu."
1,"Don't Bother, It's Just Dead","This show isn't even walking anymore. I didn't imagine it possible, but AMC has turned a post apocalyptic zombie thriller into a boring soap opera. The silly interpersonal relationship issues are just ridiculous, and drag on, and on. With very sparse sprinkles of zombie action, this show has become a dud."
1,"ok book, not enough info on things around him",I found myself rather disapointed because boyington spent most of the book describing his thoughts and fellings and life and not enough of what was going on around him. It was as if he was trying to make everyone feel sorry for him.
1,not the same as it used to be,"yes, it straightens your hair more more it smells like a bad chemical. I read about the ingredients and learned that they are not the best to use. I was desperate and you used it anyway but this isn't the same product it used to be years ago. It felt like I was using a relaxer. I would probably find a different product."
1,Supposed CD Racks,These boxes are too narrow to hold CD cases. What a rip! They look nice but that makes them even more disappointing.
1,Why read a book about people you don't like?,"This was an easy read, which was the only reason why I finished it. I didn't like any of the characters. They were obnoxious and boring. Why the two protagonists fall in love is not understandable, they are both so annoying. Most of the supporting characters are worse. If the writer could come up with some likeable characters for her next book it might be fun because she has a rather readable style."
1,DIED after just 7 months,"I also bought this because of the good reviews and because I didn't want to spend >$120 on a new battery. At first it worked great, but after 5-6 months it started to lose charge very fast. Then it would only partially charge, sporadically recharging in tiny increments. By 7-8 months, it was solidly at 0% and wouldn't recharge. Maybe it's worth it to by from Apple."
1,Teensiest weenie,My own fault in not catching the actual size. This is absurdly small unless you are only measuring perhaps a medication or spice etc. not practical for real food.
1,yee-ha!,"I must admit I was a little taken aback by some of the quotes. The ageing of this book shows in some phrases such as ""Got any Veras?"" which, incidentally, is Brit-slang for an illegal drug. However, what I wasn't prepared for was Suess' rampant homosexuality coming to the fore with ... unforgettable quotes ... What worldly homophobic adult wouldn't be concerned about presenting this book to a youngster? I, for one, re-ordered several copies. Vive Le Revolution."
1,wrong perfume,"I got the wrong perfume my order was ""Lancetti Perfume"" (yellow box) but I got ""leidi Lancetti"" (red box). i sent three e-mails and waited for more than 2 weeks and no one reply.just bad support."
1,I will never subject myself to DRM,"For me to spend money on this game it would be to buy it. I will not rent the game (3 installs) for this price, which is what the DRM is essentially doing. This is a dishonest and invasive move by EA."
1,Don't waste your time,"This had to be one of the worst books I have read in a long time. It looked promising. Even half way thru it picked up a little, but when I read the last page, I turned it over looking for the end of the story. This book is choppy, disconnected and just flat poorly written. Main character is a whining woman who gets on your nerves and stays there. She never changes.Do NOT waste your time or money on this, there are too many other good books to read"
1,Can't stop them coming - cancel order but they keep sending,I am sick and tired of cancelling this order and no one paying attention.I have cancelled this order again and again and I keep getting it.I have written several letters and no response. I am going to BetterBusiness Bureau to tell them what a lousy company you are. I am sick ofgetting these packages every month.
1,do not read the giver,"This book is not good at all. It is very boring and really doesn't have a storyline and it seems too fake to think that it is anything close to the real world that we live in. The characters are always perfect and always become the same people in the inside. The people in this book can not choose their future, which is not fair. The book gets very boring after like the first chapter. I do not recommend this book."
1,who made this,Cheap plastic hand grip. I used this brush twice. The bristles began dropping out as if it was not meant to get wet. It dropped and the handle broke.Dont waste your money.P Coleman
1,Waste of money,"The lines that indicate the amounts wipe right off. I have to redraw them on with a sharpie. It is also loose fitting & the clear plastic outer part will slide down as you are measuring items, causing a mess! I am very disappointed & would not recommend this product. I plan to return it to amazon if they will refund my money."
1,If you're NOT breast feeding-DON'T Bother!,"This book is not only useless but also insulting to women with formula fed infants. I found that while searching for information, a condescending tone was taken regarding what you feed your baby for EVERYTHING you look up.Not all women breastfeed.It was the middle of the night, I was worried about my newborn and threw this book in the garbage out of sheer frustration!"
1,Great Movie...but really...31$ a pop,"I've seen the movie in 3D, I love it, it was well worth the money and effort to go see; the work is excellent, the comedy is excellent [with enough Adult Only in jokes to keep the parents amused]... BUT I am just so taken aback that this item is for sale on here at $30.95. Why? It's not even a 'new release'. No disc warrants that amount of money... no matter how many times the little ones will watch it. And I see that the bluray version is cheaper. Is this the same ploy that the music industry used to get us to switch to the infinitely more profitable CD format from vinyl? Make the newer [and more profitable in the long run] format cheaper? I know it isn't Amazon that is racking this up to insane prices [at least I hope it isn't :)]. I think people should just boycott items that are overpriced, either online or in stores. The companies will soon get the message.by the way, this item retails here in Ireland in store for Euro 9.99 which comes to about $14.00."
1,Unintuitive,"This is the most unintuitive calculator I've ever used. One example that I still could not figure out how to do in a convenient way: I have a number displayed in 2 floating decimal and I want to see it in 5 floating decimal, I have 2 ways: (1) multiply the current value with 1000, write down the number then divide it back 1000; (2) store the number to the memory, press [2nd][format][5][enter], then press [2nd][quit], then recall the number back from the memory. What kind of calculator is this? If somebody can show me a quicker way, I would appreciate it."
1,Slow and boring,"I love science fiction, but not this movie. The first few minutes are great. A man wakes up without a memory. He is confused and scared. Then everything just becomes a painful, slow bore. The beautiful and talented Jennifer Connelly is wasted in this atrocious movie. Sleep. You can go to sleep. Sleep I did."
1,"How do you define ""open""...","If you define it as poking a slot around 1/3 of the can and then getting stuck in the middle, then this works great. Otherwise, forget it.I got about two cans actually open before it stopped working. Seems like it's low on batteries. Let's see, two fresh alkalines / 2 cans opened = 1 battery used per can. If you don't think that's a great deal, this pile of junk is not for you. Oh, and I am not talking about the wholesale sized coffee can with a 12"" diameter lid, either, these were little tiny baby sized tuna cans.You'd be better off paying some kid $20 to stomp on your foot with baseball cleats. IT WOULD BE THAT MUCH MORE ENJOYABLE."
1,"Battery is wrong, this is garbage","FOREIGNER IS THE WORST OF THE WORST.THEY ARE EVEN MORE WORSE THAN GREEN DAY.EACH AND EVERY SONG AND ALBUM OF THEIR SUCKS.WAITING FOR A GIRL LIKE YOU IS THE MOST IDIOTIC SONG I HAVE EVER HEARD.DONT LISTEN TO THE REVIEWER BELOW ME WHO IS AN ALIAS OF WHIRLIGIG FROM BAKERSFIELD CALIFORNIA.BUY ANY CD FROM ICONS LIKE LED ZEPPELIN,PINK FLOYD,THE ROLLING STONES,QUEEN AND AC/DC INSTEAD."
1,Larry Walker,"bottom platform was warped, bat doesn't fit in hand. If I would of seen it it first would not of bought it,"
1,Littman is one terrific fiction writer.,"Having finished this book, I thought to myself ""that was aterrific novel"" and then realized that this was supposed tobe a factual book.The author creates his own dialogue, thoughts and events to make the story more appealing, but in the process, loses one important thing -- the truth.Anyone wishing to know the true stories of Kevin Poulsen, Justin Petersen or Ron Austin should not look to this book as a fact source. This book is pure fluff and at best, can be used as a paperweight."
1,waste of time & money,"i'm sure author is a nice guy and a decent artist, but it's hard to believe this got published. obviously wasn't edited. everything imparted is just common sense. geared to street artists. save your money. read free articles on internet. seriously."
1,There are better shower albums out there!,"I bought this album for my best friend's baby shower and overall, I was really disappointed with it. The one thing I do like is the front cover - a really cute design and a place to put a picture of the mom-to-be or the baby. Otherwise, it is very underwhelming. The pages are relatively small (you could fit one 4x6 picture on a page) and so there isn't a lot of room for pasting bits of the napkins, ribbons, etc. Also, the invitation I used would definately not fit on the page dedicated to the invitation. There are pages for all the basic information (the scene, menu, guest list, baby gifts, crystal ball- prediction for baby, advice pages, wisdom from the grandparents, shower fun and games, shower keepsakes, and photos), but it was totally uninspiring.I got another shower album from Hallmark (the one with the sun on the front) and liked it a lot better - it even had a page dedicated to the wrapping paper from baby's presents (which this one didn't!)."
1,VERY DISAPPOINTED,For the high price of this video I expected a professional production instead of an obviously homemade job with background noise that includes sounds like traffic. Mr. Shapiro is supposed to be a Paine scholar but he's not even sure if Paine was ever married. You'll be embarassed for Mr. Shapiro and his presentation.

1,Murky lighting prevents viewing,"This film is almost impossible to watch on Amazon Instant Video. The screen is so dark you cannot see the actors in more than half the scenes. I've heard that movies shot in 3D are dark and dingy, but this is ridiculous."
1,Dont buy this hair dryer,I have bought hair dryers that lasted years and years with daily use. This one I had for 3 months and it just stop working. Don't waste your money on this item.
1,Warmed-over P. Floyd?,"Must confess to disappointment; this sounded like a record I would like. Well, they have a great name, and the artwork on the CD is really cool. However, the music itself, while tastefully done, is surprisingly unremarkable. Just because this type of thing has been done before doesn't mean that makes it bad. What makes it bad is that it has been done better and more compellingly before. Pink Floyd, Mercury Rev, and to a degree the Flaming Lips have created much finer ""orchestral"" soundscapes. The antisocial rantings that float through the music grow very tiresome with repeated listenings, and do little to inspire any feeling whatsoever. I appreciate the attempt to make a statement about millennial paranoia/angst, but would like more than one statement per record, you know? Not worth the money!"
1,Dissapointed,"I grew up on 80's rock. When I saw Scorpions had a new CD out(on Amazon)I couldn't wait to hear some samples. The music sampler saved me some bucks. EyeIIEye was a total dissapointment. If you're expecting classic Scorpions jam, forget it. Some bands such as Metallica have matured in their music. Unfortuneately it didn't work for the Scorpions.They should have stuck with what they do best....ROCK! Most of us 80's fans are alive and kicking. For a band as good as the Scorpions, it's a real dissapointment they couldn't do better."
1,sophomore slump,"Ronnie Montrose had a heavy metal classic with his first album; so what was the logical next move? Evidently, turn down the guitars, add synthesizers, and put some boring slow ballads into the mix. What could have been a monster 70's act instead quickly (and deservedly) faded into obscurity. I recently bought the CD to see if it was as disappointing as I remember it back in '77. It was."
1,"""Very Boring""",I lot of unnecessary writing. Too boring. I will not be picking up anything else by this author. For all the readers that rated this book a 4 or 5....they must have mistaken this book for another.
1,DVDs Defective,This is one of my favourite series'. I would've given this 5 stars except for the fact that several of the dvds are defective. Episodes keep skipping so much that sometimes I can't even see more than a half or a third of an episode. I spent so much money on this and it feels like a con - like I bought bootleg or something.
1,I have problems with the firmware update,"I try to update the firmware, but after this the microtrack could not turn on again.I had to send back to tech support to fix the problem, and I did not receive the product fixed.I like the compactness and the quality."
1,Use as a last resort,I am a teacher and have tried using multiplication rock in class. Most of the songs are not very catchy sounding and my students had a difficult time memorizing the facts. It is not worth the money and I found that pairing stories to facts is more effective than this cd. Only buy it if nothing else is working for your child or class.
1,"It's the translation of Hazel E. Barnes, but has a lot of typos","It is good to have a Kindle version of a good philosophical work, but it is rendered useless when you find a lot of typos. Some of them: in the original says ""interiority"", this version, ""inferiority""; not one time, but several. Even if the work is based on the translation of Hazel E. Barnes, this errors can lead to misunderstanding of the key statements of the book."
1,Shame,"As a French listener,and in the name of the French Nation, I adress myself to the Anglo-Saxon people to beg for their mercy. I solemnly declare I am sorry such a thing as an obispo song ever touched your kind ears, and my only consolation is you probably didn't quite understand the words. Then, I could say it's a fair revenge, considering for how long we've been blissfully listening to terrific sounding protest or love songs in English the translation of which would leave us abashed and amazed. Let me tell you, a song such as ""Lucie"" is the stupidest song ever written, and to hear and see the shaved halfwit sing it with deep expressions of suffering on his face makes me sick before I have time to laugh."
1,Cute Title,"I purchased this book based on the reviews. The title is the best part of the book. It reads like j random blog returned by a google search on 'greek blog'. If you are trying to choose a Greek Island to visit allow me to suggest Freely's Cyclades or Eyewitness Greek Islands. If you want entertainment choose Kazantzakis or Homer. If you want a printed blog and feel the need to spend money while killing a tree, choose Greek Salad."
1,Heritage Hill Jar,"The glass shape was lovely, but the lid was cracked when I opened it. Unfortunately I had discarded the billing information before I noticed the hairline crack."
1,"Works for the first month, after that it fell apart","I bought this cover to protect my harley 1200 sportster. It worked well for the first month, but it quickly developed holes all over. Also, the hooks you use to attach it to the bottom of your bike both fell off pretty quickly.I kept my bike outdoors, and it rarely rained of was windy. I was careful putting it on an off. Now the cover is riddled with holes and is pretty much useless.I would not recommend this bag for larger bikes like mine. It seems if the cover is under any stress it will rip and tear."
1,Look through it in person first.....,"I looked through this book at a craft store the other day, and as a person who loves the ocean and seashells, I found maybe one project in here that I would consider making. Just about every project uses a ridiculous amount of shells so imagine the cost would be prohibitive and for this reason projects look overly ornate. Unless that is the look you are seeking to accomplish, I wouldn't recommend this book. Try to find ""Decorating with Seashells"" by Anita Louise Crane"
1,WORST EVER,NEVER RECEIVED IT. WISH I HAD KNOWN THE SELLER WAS DISHONEST AND NOT GOOD AT COMMUNICATING!!!! I MIGHT AS WELL JUST GO BUY THE DVD AT THE STORE!!! VERY VERY DISPLEASED.
1,Dangerous & Disappointing!,"After using this seat for just 4 months, some of the small parts (screws & bolts) have started to fall off already! They are not only a choking hazard for my baby, but now the seat is a hazard as well. We have another bouncy seat that gets just as much use and it is holding up fine + has no small (dangerous) assembly parts.Do not buy this seat! I regret it and now have to throw it out & buy another one. I doubt that it would have made a suitable toddler seat eventually anyway, as my baby at 6 months is already almost too long for it. Keep looking!!!"
1,Cool,This is a good album but i think it would of been better if playa fly was still with them. He could bust clean A$$ lyrics.
1,Leaky tire,"I had to put atube in the tire after a month, tire arrived leaking and never stoppedGet it somewhere else"
1,Garbage,"I purchased this item for my 4 Year old daughter. It had to be almost pitch black in order to get a clear view of the picture to trace. Once we had a clear view, the pallet would slide all over the table top. Horrible TOY!! A RIP OFF!! Crayola just lost a customer!!!!"
1,Disappointed,"Got this in the mail hoping it would sharpen better than my manual limited skills, only to find out after practice I could sharpen them better with a stone than this. I am about as amatuer of a knife sharpener as it gets. I have sharpened walmart knives and more expensive knives and the end result is: This does a poor job. Unfortunately I chalked it up to inexperience but it's just a cheap sharpener. I'm not sure how it gets such positive reviews. I believe a pretty ignorant person should be able to buy this, put their knives in and they should come out sharp as new (or sharper). This did not achieve that desired result.I would not recommend this. It sits in the cupboard."
1,For frisbee collectors only,"Don't be fooled by the title, this is not the complete book of frisbee. Ultimate only rates a couple of pages, for starters. There is nothing to speak of on throwing technique. It is not particularly well edited, either - many assertions and heresay have slipped through the net. Lots of nice pictures of collectable discs, if that's what you're into. A bit of a disappointment given the dearth of books-in-print about throwing technique and ultimate."
1,Wallace Silversmiths has terrible customer service!,"While the traditional bells are beautiful, if you ever have a problem with one, Wallace Silversmiths Customer Service Department is NO HELP! They clearly stated to me in an e-mail that ""since we are not a direct seller to public and have this item manufactured (overseas), and sold direct to retail, we have NO facilities or pieces (as manufacturing season is OVER and we have sold out inventory) available to send."" They offer no further assistance."
1,"Basically A Rehash Of ""Bobbi Brown Beauty""","I am definitely an admirer of Bobbi Brown, whose lovely makeup designs can actually be worn by real women in real life. Her book ""Bobbi Brown Beauty"" is one of my favorites. However, much of the advice in that book is repeated in this one. There are new features in this book; for instance, a section on makeup for cancer patients and sections on makeup to wear for each decade of your life. However, about seventy percent of the advice in this book was dealt with in the previous publication. I would only purchase this book at a bargain price."
1,very disappointed,This product never reached the delivery address. We were very disappointed by this as it was a present to Grandfather from our son. We have used Amazon for a number of years and never had any problems but are truly disappointed about this.
1,Blasphemous,"The author's interpretation of the Bible's comments on masculinity are his very own, and because of that, attempts breach the contract between the believer and God. It's blastphemous (not to mention silly) and the promise keepers fuzzy goal is distinctly UnAmerican."
1,doesn't hold a charge,"I used it once right after I bought it and it was fine. I needed to use it again 3 months later and it didn't work anymore. I took it back to the store, Strauss Auto, they refused to take it back because it was more than a month. I called the importer and they said I need to mail it to them to California at my own cost. Since it's so heavy the shipping is expensive and it also bound to happen again since it is a low-grade product."
1,waste of money,what a waste of money. nothing new and exciting in this little mini book..not worth the money or hassle it took to get it.
1,It's definately NOT HOT,"Paris Paris Paris..I was expecting some cute stories and some real 'behind the scene' pictures of her life as an heiress..that's all, I wasn't expecting much. 15 minutes later and I finished the book, very unsatisfying..The lists of how to be and not be a wannabe were cliche, not original and definately not useful. Ha ha I know its tongue and cheek but really c'mon. At least include pictures that haven't been seen before..every picture was in Star or In Touch.I'm so over it!"
1,wrong product did not match the picture on the site.,The picture on this site is like the hammock that I need to replace. When I got it it was not the one that I thought it was. It will cost more to ship it back than I paid for the product originally.
1,WILL NOT HOLD BATTERY CHARGE AT ALL,This is an extremely poor product. It constantly shuts off and states that there is a low battery charge. It is so unreliable that I'm looking for another light for my camcorder. I do not recommend the product becuause it simply doesn't work.
1,Wrong Singer,"I love the songs on this album, but the singing was terrible. Charlotte Church, whomever that is, does not appear destined to make a career with her voice. I give this 4 for the material and a 1 for singing. On balance, a 2 seems fair."
1,This album sounds cheap,"THe dead kennedys talk too much about polotics in their music, if I wanted to here polotics I would turn on C-span. Thank you with much thought Look Out Rec. I.D. Tim"
1,Inferior Product,"I work at a pet store, and we've used this litter for our cats in the store's adoption program. I'm the one who cleans the litter boxes every day. This litter may be natural, flushable, and generally healthier for your cat, but the smell is horrendous. I put plenty of litter in each box, and the cats have never had diarrhea. However, the smell from the litter is that of strong vomit, and it's enough to bring me to the point of vomiting myself.If you live in a large house, or have your litter in an unoccupied basement, then this shouldn't be a major issue. If your living arrangements are rather small, then you should choose a different litter. I recommend Swheat Scoop and the Healthy Pet varieties in my high-end pet store for customers who want a natural product, and use Tidy Cats myself which I buy in Target because it has superior odor control."
1,"Crumb catcher is great, sides are flimsy. Overall, a semi- fail.","The base works fine as a nice cutting board that catches the crumbs. I had my husband take the sides off - it was really flimsy and difficult to hold the bread in place while slicing, thus missing the point of having slicing guides for uniform slices. The little plastic end plate kept falling out as well. My first instinct was to throw the whole thing in the trash, but then I realized I like the board, just not the slicing guides. SO I got a crumb catching cutting board out of it and more plastic in the landfill, lol."
1,Try to talk your kid out of it!,"My son is 4 and loves the Ghostbuster song so he wanted to be a Ghostbuster this year. I bought him the size SMALL 4-6 and is recommended for 3-4 year olds. He is very average on his size but this outfit looks like it would fit my 8 year old daughter better. I checked the tag and it said small. There is extra room on the arms, legs and waist. There is about 4-6 inches extra on the arms and about 6-8 inches extra on the legs and the crotch area hangs down to his knees...needless to say, I'm going to either have to roll it up for him, get it hemmed or just get a whole new costume all together. Also, it is made poorly...there are strings hanging off everywhere! I haven't even opened the backpack yet...kind of scared to see what's wrong with it. Don't waste your money!"
1,dont waste your time,"waste of money and time, look at a underware magazine for free! l l l l l l l l"
1,BEWARE: AMAZON SHIPS THIS ITEM USED,"While the vacuum seems to be fine, I am on my second one - the first one arrived and the box was clearly double taped and had been opened before - when I took it out it was clear why in that the back panel was broken and would not close. So, packed it up, printed return label, and asked Amazon to send another. They did, and this one ALSO arrived and had clearly been a return/been opened - there were no instructions, minor scratches, and fingerprints and dust on the handle. Overall, best Amazon would do was a partial discount for a used item, but took 15 minutes of saying no to a woman who kept saying she had no options for me on the help line.Overall, very poor service from Amazon."
1,had promise but goes pfffttt.,"Well, I just saw what everyone was saying should win the Oscar for best picture. I thought it was going that way for the first twenty minutes or so of the film. It sure did keep me wondering and riveted. However, like a lot of movies tackling complex themes and ideas, it had to resort to a trainwreck of an ending...Suddenly, from suspense to psychological, it takes a turn for the philosophical. It's not as bad as Vanilla Sky, but you get the feeling they're in the same new genre--the I-Can-Do-Anything-With-This-Movie-And-Come-Out-Original genre. I had more questions than answers after the movie ended which that explanation just didn't solve. Too bad, I really wanted to like it...go watch Insomnia for real psychological suspense and thrills--no, not the remake from Memento's director, Christopher Nolan, but the original by Erik Skjoldbjaerg. (Now, let's see short term memory deal with that name.)"
1,"Didn't ""get"" it....","I am so glad I read other people's reviews of this book. I actually thought maybe I'd had a stroke and it was a ""brain thing"" that caused me not to be able to follow this book. I'd loved ""Ellen Foster"" and, even though I knew this book hadn't received RAVE reviews, I thought ""How bad can it be?"" Pretty bad. I wouldn't have finished it at all except that my son had given me a gift card to a bookstore for Xmas, and this was one of the books I purchased. I usually like Kaye Gibbons's books, but this was not one I'd recommend."
1,Missed Opportunity,"I saw The Who three times during last years tour. This DVD comes close to capturing their show but has some serious limitations. Picture quality is great, but why must we suffer a jump cut every one to two seconds? Does the director feel this is necessary to maintain our interest? Just when you start to enjoy a scene, you're off to see a super close up of someone or whole hall shot. They should of left the spinning camera zooms back in the sixties. Very distracting. The sound is fair with a somewhat muddy drum and bass mix. And the guests? I can see Eddie Vedder, but Bryan Adams???? Why butcher Who classics just to drag in more guests? Ugh! The band is 5 stars. The DVD missed, it's a 2. A band of this quality deserves more. Hang the director, editor and sound engineer."
1,Not a Quality tool for the money.,I guess I just got one from a bad lot. But none of the internal tools willstay locked open. When you try to use them they will fold in on your hand.When I spend this much money for a multi-tool I really am expecting a littlemore quality in the tool. I also have a Gerber that I paid half as much forand is a better tool that I have gone back to. At least the knives stay lockedopen on this tool or I would be pecking this review.
1,Very Cheaply made,"The seat is set up where you slip two metal bars threw the material to make the top shape, but there is nothing to keep the bars from sliping around, so as the child is jumping the bar is moving making an akward shape which sometimes will move the straps in front of the child or in weird places."
1,Don't bother.,"I have built a very nice home theater and music listening room. I am a believer in the potential of recorded music to create a 3 dimensional, holographic listening experience to match the stunning visual effects coming out of the high definition BD movies being released and to stand on it's own as a thoroughly entertaining medium. That's how I got sucked in. The titles of this artists work promise volumes but each track tells the sames short story over and over and over again...even from disk to disc. If you have to, pls only buy one of his works. I advise you to take my word for that fact that every one of his disks are identical in theme, compositional technique, etc."
1,(...),"(...)This is like the Dick and Jane books we learned to read with. That was fine for first grade but come on, we're adults now. Don't waste your money."
1,"Dimmable CFL but it doesn't really, uhhh.... dim...","I'm a major fan of CFLs. I have them all over my house. I finally installed a dimmer with my newly installed recessed lights in my living room and looked all over the place to find these hard-to-find dimmable CFLs. I bought them and tried them along side my soft white incandescents. At full brightness, it is clearly whiter and brighter hands down. Unfortunately when I started dimming, these GEs barely dimmed at all. I would be generous to say that they dim to 50% brightness. What good is a light that's advertised to be dimmable but doesn't really dim? I'm going to return them in hopes that GE or some other company will develop one that actually dims as well as incandescents."
1,"Barry's Gold Blend Tea, 80-Count Tea Bags",The tea was a bit too bold for me. It is probably for a more seasoned tea drinker than myself.
1,Reliability Issues,"Great when it works. Unfortunately, that's not all the time. My first one had an internal leak right out of the box. My second one got past that, but often jams when retracting its grounds ejector and does not flow the coffee well."
1,Not Panasonic's Best Outing,"I tried two of these just to make sure one unit wasn't defective. I must've missed the previous poster who commented that the phone IDs only half the time. TRUE! On both units I had. And calls to Panasonic are useless.I have other cordless systems in my house, both by Panasonic (though 2.4Ghz) and they never miss ID'ing a call.I can't see spending good money on an otherwise nice system which fails at least 25% of the time."
1,Bad Choice-Just say NO !!!!!!!,"I purchased these plugs after veiwing them on popular tv shows. I also looked at previous reviews on this site. I should have heeded the reviews more than the selling points of the sponsered tv shows. Within a month after installing these plugs I now have severe misfiring. I am sending these plugs back to E3 under thier warranty. Hopefully they will refund (at thier choice) rather than send me replacements that I no longer want or need.On the other hand I did get better gas milage for about a tankful of gas(midgrade)but that stopped after about 100 miles of my nexted fillup (same gas, same brand).I reccomend that you think about another brand and listen to other reviews rather than buy into another gimmick."
1,No.,"Don't buy this one.This video contains all of less than half the videos on They Might Be Giants's later release, Direct From Brooklyn, which is also available here on VHS. New, I might add. Although these videos are great, don't waste your money on this tape when you could just get Direct From Brooklyn instead. You won't miss anything by buying the later video. (Unless you just want this for the slipcase or something.)"
1,300 Pages Too Long,Mr Weber must have been paid by the word for this novel. It could have been a great read except for all of the padding. I guess Mr Weber's editor was on vacation.
1,Skip it!,"As I love a good suspense novel, I bought this book based on the jacket synopsis and was deeply disappointed when I finished reading it. I found all of the characters completely unlikeable and underdeveloped, and towards the end I didn't care WHO was blackmailing Delia. I also found it completely unbelievable that every man Johnny spoke with during his investigation had no problem immediately opening up to him about Delia. It's implausible that each would share intimate details to a complete stranger who thinks they may be a blackmailer! I, too, found the movie character/actor references annoying. Finally, I was perturbed that the author chose not to reveal Delia's secret sexual ""tricks"" after going on and on about them throughout the book (couldn't think of anything spicy enough?) In all, I found this book to be boring and not quite the page-turner I was hoping for. If you want a real sexual, suspenseful, who-done-it, check out Romeo by Elise Title."
1,Defective product,"I bought this switch inspite of negative feedback because I wanted the rocker style to go with the other switches in my house. I installed the switch and got it to work. It worked (most of the time) for two days and quit. I checked the connections and the were solid. I have returned the switch to Amazon. Please save yourself the grief, don't buy this product"
1,"Nice price, but...","I bought this holder for my dad's LG2000. I thought it was a good price for something that he wanted; however, you really get what you pay for. I had to buy him a leather holder instead, after he received this ratcheting swivel belt holster and lost his phone while using it. It's only a small piece of plastic. The phone clips inside of it, of course. It seems that it is sturdy at first, but if you move around a lot or simply hit it from the top, then it will pop out. Luckily, someone found dad's phone and returned it to him unharmed! My advice: don't buy this product unless your phone is insured."
1,Do not order this belly ring!,What you see in the picture is not what you get!My mom ordered this for my daughter for Xmas. We received it really quickly but when we looked at it we were shocked how little it resembled the picture.The metal was not nearly as smooth and where it dangles was really stiff.The butterfly looked nothing like a butterfly and the gems looked really cheap and glued on.I had thought it was a great deal when I really just got what I paid for on this one.Then she opened it put it on and it broke 30 minutes later.The guitar broke right off.I've learned my lesson and I won't buy body jewelry online and I'll never buy from this company again.Take it from me and go buy your jewelry from a store so you don't get ripped off like I did.
1,This is the worst trimmer I have ever owned!,"I saw the ads for the Trim-N-Vac trimmer and thought it was a good idea. But that is all it was an idea. The trim guard pops off in the middle of trimming(oops there's a bald spot), then when you put the guard back on, thinking that the guard is at the same trim length that it was set at when you started, suprise it is back to a number 1 while the lever says 4. On top of all that, the vacume does not have enough suction to catch 1/4 of the hair so you might as well be using a trimmer that does not have this feature and will trim even. This was a BIG WASTE OF MONEY!!!"
1,Disappointing,"I bought this for my annual camping trip and was very excited when I received it. It was nice and large, and the folding handle was a cool feature...made for easy packing. But my excitement wore off the very first time I used it. I lit up the camping stove and started cooking some scrambled eggs. It seemed fine at first, but as it heated up the middle became extremely hot and there didn't seem to be good heat distribution. I stirred the eggs using a soft silicon spatula (no metal at all), but the non-stick surface in the middle still started chipping off. So after just one quick use, the inside of the pan was already missing some coating and the bottom was also heavily scratched from sitting on the stove. I'm be throwing this pan away and looking for something else for next year's trip."
1,"Don't waste your $! Overprice information,nothing special!",I was hoping for more information in the subject. Was very retard. This is the worst tape ever about this subject.
1,sucked,"This movie was boring,, no action,, bad acting,,while watching this movie I realized what Madonna is good for."
1,JUST STICK WITH THE FIRST 3!,"THIS GAME REALLY SUCKED! JUST STICK WITH THE FIRST 3 IN THE SERIES. NO WONDER WHY THIS ONE WAS NOT INCLUDED IN THE ONIMUSHA ESSENTIALS COLLECTION! THE GAME PLAY IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT AND OTHER CHARACTERS ARE SELECTABLE, THIS ONE SHOULD HAVE BEEN LIKE THE OTHER 3. SO PLEASE, STAY AWAY FROM THIS ONE. IF U HAVE NOT PLAYED THE FIRST 3, NOW IS THE TIME, GET ONIMUSHA ESSENTIALS! U WILL GET YOUR MONEYS WORTH!!!!!!!!"
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY,There is nothing I like about this product.I would not recommend it to anyone - friend or foe.Sorry
1,Disappointed!,We really love the CD but were very disappointed that the CD brochure appears to have been wet and is all stuck together ;-( Seller should have mentioned that in it's description. I had not been an ABBA fan until recently and was sad that I could not read the info!!
1,Kindle version full of typos,"The writing is excellent and the story is compelling. However, the Kindle version is full of typos that should have been obvious."
1,Awful...,"If you liked office space, I can assure you this is nothing like it. This movie will horrify you and do nothing but take precious time away from worthwhile endeavors. If I were Luke Wilson I'd be embarrassed to have my name on the cover of the DVD. What really should've tipped me off that this was going to be awful is that Dax Shepard is in it. He's never been funny and I feel stupid for actually thinking this movie might've been worth watching. 0 stars would be the rating if I could give it that."
1,Very disappointing,This game is no different than MVP 2003 and is blown away by ESPN Major Leauge Baseball 2k4.The graphics are choppyThe crowd sucksGraphics B-Gameplay B+Sound C+Realism B-DO NOT get this game! i wasted 50 $
1,whats wrong with the director,"the directing sucks , the director keep taking close shots and you cant see anything , i mean nsync depends on group dancing , we have to see them all dancing , not only one of them danicng , MSG was really beeter than this one , you can see everything on the stage and enjoy the boys dancing together.dont buy it .. waste of money"
1,"Here today, gone tomorrow","This blender got raves in Cook's Illustrated, which is why I bought it. At first it was great (we make a lot of smoothies from frozen fruit). After a couple of months, I thought it seemed louder than before, but shrugged it off thinking that it must have always been that loud, as it was still working fine. Well it turns out the noise was based on the fact that the blender basically vibrated itself apart! Didn't last more than four months."
1,Cheap looking shovel,"To avoid the annoyance of returning and selecting another shovel, I decided to keep this one despite the fact it looks like it won't make it through the winter. The scoop part is made from clear plastic--not too impressive. It's very light weight. Not a good value for the money from what I can see. Time will tell."
1,Waste of paper,"The ideas and recipes are fine, but so many of them are way too simple to warrant a full page. Why does it take a full page to say: ""wash, chop, eat"" or for the more complex recipes: ""wash, chop, blend, drink""?Reader friendly with lots of white space...yes.Ridiculous waste of paper...yes."
1,Creative Zen Nano Plus 1 GB MP3 Player (Blue),"This mp3 player has good features but with little instructions provided, it is nearly impossible to use. So far, we have only been able to download a few songs and those were songs already on my computer and has not allowed us to download purchased songs yet.The buttons are also a challenge to use. I still haven't figured them out and given the time involved in doing so I probably never will.I am disappointed in the ease of use for this product."
1,sounded good,"I have been a hip hop rap fan all my life and I seen alot of one hit wonders go through the industry, and basically that's all I thought of this album or tightest whitest he does have good lyrics and an alright flow but there are others in his area better than him like Sonik Flow if you want a good album buy flow's not this"
1,parts don't fit together,"It is strongly built and works well BUT,1. Each shelf had a hook on each of the 4 corners to attach to side frames. However, the back piece was too wide and one of hooks on each shelf would not attach. I fixed this by using 1 1/2 inch 'S' hooks.2. There are six divider rods, two for each shelf, to divide the rows of cans. They were too short and would not fit. This is not a problem because the dividers are not really necessary. It works fine without them.3. It is fairly easy to assemble but it would have been nice if a one page exploded view were included for those not so mechanically inclined."
1,Not worth of time and money.,This was the first book I had bought for my endeavor into the world of SOAP. Having read first few chapters it became quite apparent that either the author didn't have good knowledge about the subject matter or did a mediocre job to write this book in a hurry so that he can cash in on this craze of new technology. The sample codes are hard to comprehend meaning one may not understand the code at the first glance. The subject matter depicted in a inconsistent and incoherent manner. The book lacks any kind of structure.
1,Great Book With A Huge Mistake,"This is one of the greatest books but with a Big Mistake in Calculating Fertilization Rates ,.the author in page 834 (calibration Formulas and Conversion Used and wrote a wrong conversionTo Covert lbs/1000sqft Multiply By 4.91 to obtain Kg/100m2 the actuall number should have been 0.4883 he then used this in all his calculations like in page 320 ""Nitrogern Rates of Golf greens is from 8 to 24 pounds of nitrogen per 1000 square feet (39 to 118 Kg N/100m2)....""It should have been 3.9 to 11.8 Kg N/100m2 this is a huge mistake in the book since in my country we use Kg (metric units) So I used the wrriten numbers without noticing the mistake till my green was ruined !!! so untill the author fixes this you should not buy this book (if you dont use Metric units then no problem but then i dont know if his numbers are correct every time)check the converstion table that he copied wrongly[...]"
1,Panasonic BB-HCM-371a,I have owned two of these camera's and neither one ever worked properly. The first once had a main board failure and the second one fails to boot up past the orange light blinbk and then goes solid. This is probable the worst and most problematic camera for the money. There are several others at half the price that are better.
1,"garbage, absolute garbage",followed the directions perfectly three different times and three different times the stuff would not stick. and then i would have to clean up the gunk it leaves and use the real contact cement.i cannot believe that DAP would actually sell this stuff. i complained to DAP and they suggested i get a refund--i suggest they take this product off the market.
1,Thirty Something Parents,"I have found the articles in this magazine catering to aspecific group of women...middle to upper income, high levelof support with husband and healthy baby. The articles areare annoyingly age biased . The bulk of the magazine is commercial sales of items that will be greatly discounted in your next garage sale. The articles are written as if to address an audience of niave, immature , inexperienced and not too bright women. The writers fail to see todays women as educated and intelligent.This magazine would be helpful for the school age, 1st time mom."
1,Oh my god!,Haven't seen such terrible movie for a long time!! The idea is old. You can pretty much predict what's gonna happen next which is terrible for an action movie. The worst is this kinda stories usually end up with no where to go and so does this movie. I believe those people who made the film still wandering around what they gonna do for the end during the hooting and that's why you can see the alternative endings in the DVD. I don't even what to see those endings because they will still lead NO WHERE! Bottom line: Don't waste your time.
1,OK,"Inexpensive, but you get what you pay for. We used them in a heavily-used computer lab for K-6 grade. They would last 2-4 months at best even when we had hooks on the computer for students to hang them on. Foam pads fell off.within the first few weeks."
1,Snow Flower and the Secret Fan,"Lisa See has a good story here with lots of cultural information, especially in the area of foot-binding. Her writing, though, has much to be desired. She lacks the eloquence that other writers in this genre have mastered. The audio book version of this book is very annoying as it displays an over abundance of insincere sounding drama in the narrator's deliverance."
1,Poorly written waste of time,I'm a professional writer and a recovering alcoholic with 25 years' sobriety. This book is a pretentious and incomprehensible attempt to be 'literary.' I wasted my time and hard-earned cash on the hard-cover edition. Go to a movie instead.
1,Misrepresentation,"Please save you money and enjoy the full text of Mere Christianity by CS Lewis. To read one, though very good chapter, from this book will not offer anyone any real appreciation for Mere Christianity. What HarperSanFranisco & Ms Klien are doing is simple misrepresentation, the let the buyer beware school of marketing, the ""what's in it for me school of commerce"". Please save you money, return the book & read the real CS Lewis."
1,broke after 2 uses,don't waste your $$$ don't waste your $$$ don't waste your $$$ don't waste your $$$$$$ don't waste your $$$ don't waste your $$$ broke after 2 uses. wasn't even trying to crush ice. was just trying to grate cabbage.
1,Disappointing,"I have always loved Lamott's writings, and consider Crooked Little Heart to be one of my favorite books of all time. Unfortunately Blue Shoe didn't live up to my expectations, coming from such a great writer. I alternated between feeling pity for and frustrated with Mattie, but never got around to actually liking her. Her ""Christianity"" was also disappointing - she went to church every Sunday and prayed, but she was almost always praying for help for herself. Except for her one instance of foot washing, I did not see any other Christian qualities in Mattie. Skip this book and return to Lamott's classics."
1,wish they had told me the size earlier,The size was never put on the site before I bought it. If you read the reviews and your looking for the size its about 4x7 feet. good material just not for me
1,I Agree with So Far From True,"I agree with the review ""So Far From True."" I am from a town near Tome', New Mexico and Castillo's characters did not ring true to me either. The characters don't fit the place. They just aren't people from New Mexico. It would be like a white person from Arizona trying to create a story about white people in New York, simply because they are white. Without studying the uniqueness of the people of a particular area, the writing comes across sounding false. Many of the traditions described in Castillo's book are similar traditions but she doesn't quite get them right either. And agreed - several mountain ranges away, you would not be making the trip to Chimayo from Tome' on your knees - not even the most devote. I would recommend Castillo read ""Bless Me Ultima,"" by Rudolfo Anaya and then come back and try again."
1,Its a bait and switch,They sent the Classic pan not the Noblesse. If there was a zero I would have used it instead of a one star. I returned the pan and purchased it at Chef Central.
1,Delonghi XR640 Retro Toaster Oven,Do Not Buy This OvenThis very expensive toaster oven quit working just a couple weeks after the year warranty was up. Of course Delonghi could care less. I have now ready many reviews that this model quits after about a year often. Save your money.
1,Not sweet,I was planning on using this instead of Splenda or Sugar for coffee in the office. Guess what? It doesn't sweeten. No better than adding no sweetener. Threw the whole box in the garbage.
1,Cleaning Suggestion,"I dont have this model, but I have a larger Holmes Air purifier, and agree with the other reviews - they get themselves very dirty very quickly. I have found though, that if you put the front cover (the part hardest to clean) in the dishwasher & run it on a light cycle, it comes out perfect. Wiping the rest down with a cleaning cloth does the job as well. I wouldn't recommending buying a Holmes product, btu if you already have one, hopefully this cleaning tip will help."
1,"Great price, too good to be true","I just sent this gun back to grizzly today for a refund. It comes at a good price but you get what you pay for. The gun would shoot nails flush when it would shoot, but would not fire part of the time and would leak air buy the trigger when it miss fired. I sent for a porter cable FR350A, it has a very large amount of very good reviews at amazon and from other web sites. I have an 18ga porter cable gun that works great every time. I have heard good things about Grizzly products, but this $99 gun was just too cheaply made. Live and learn they say."
1,BEFVP41 V1.0 no longer updated by Linksys,"The latest firmware version available from Linksys for BEFVP41 V1.0 is dated 2003. Don't waste your money, and be sure to buy the more recent BEFVP41 V2.0 (latest firmware available dated jan 2005).Note that V2.0 of the router only supports 50 IPSec sessions."
1,Drat,"Boring and artless. I truly expected more from this book. It's basically a listing of people, and of driving directions.I've read one other of her books, it was boring too."
1,there's no meat in here,"This book would be great if Tim Green actually named a few names aside from the guys he's talking up (see Dion, Steve Young).Instead it's a continuous cycle of 'a player I once played with/against' did some unthinkable act. The end result is that no one cares what Green has to say because he never takes any risks and the reader becomes bored quickly.Quick tip: Read Lawrence Taylor's second autobiography for the real inside scoop on life in the NFL. LT holds nothing back, especially on himself. Now THAT's a book I couldn't put down."
1,Marilyn Monroe 10 disc Collection,"DO NOT BUY this Marilyn Monroe 10 disc Collection from 101 DISTRIBUTION unless you are crazy about huge, distracting Korean Subtitles. They have made it impossible to disable the subtitle feature, and, the large white text takes up a lot of the screen. If you thought the price was too good to be true, you'd be right. Too bad, because the quality of reproduction is really done well. Fix this problem, and you have a winner here."
1,On my list of the worst movies I've ever seen,"I like complex films but this was too much, too implausible, too ridiculous to be beleived. Worst of all this film was, at times, just plain sickening to watch. It took an especially twisted Hollyweird mind to come up with this garbage. Hey, no surprise."
1,"Good Story line, but could of been written in 400 less words","While I found this story interesting, I also found it lacking in several different ways. The author seems to ramble on and on and on about nothing that has to do with the plot. I found myself skipping several pages at a time just to get back to the story. Too much history information detailed. I love details but when you have almost one hundred pages written on what the author calls the Greek Supper. (give me a break) It was just too much. I can't say that I would recommend this book or author unless he changes his style of writing. The story of Herculine had the ability to be such a good story in the discovery of her witch craft, but in the end failed."
1,simply brutal,"The dialogue alone is so unrealistic (seriously, who swears that much ALL THE TIME!?) and unfunny, I gave up. Yes, a doofus can score with a cute babe but when I heard these people speak I just thought the scriptwriter has no clue at all. It's one thing to throw stuff in to parody couples arguing but another to just have people go off on rants.Too bad this was not a horror movie as we could have killed off the annoying Seth Rogen in scene one. Then we might have a decent movie or at least have gotten Doughboy off the screen."
1,Beautiful but not durable,"I purchased this pot for myself as a Christmas gift. I read and followed the directions for use and care, always hand-washed the pot, and I never dropped it or banged it into anything.With normal use and special care, the pot started to get chips in the enamel at the base after about three months. I used it maybe twice a week.After six months, the chips extended to the inside of the pot and it is now unusable.This is a very poorly-made product and is not up to the usual Le Creuset high quality standards despite its high price."
1,"Great, But Doesn't Last","Had this for 2-3 years and LOVED it. Sadly, the product is not built to last and I have 3 reasons for saying it:1) Parts which experience a lot wear are made of plastic, leading to failure. This shouldn't come as a shock to any engineer as plastic isn't designed to handle a lot of wear.2) The bowl handle cracked pretty quickly (no dropping, just from regular use) and eventually broke entirely.3) Even Kitchen Aid doesn't expect the product to last. New, the food processor cost is $200.00. Guess how much a 3 year extended warranty is? $216.62 (and that's even after a $38.23 savings).In short, if you are willing to buy one every 2-3 years for occasional use, then this product is for you. Personally, I am going to try something else..."
1,Just boring,"I couldn't get into this book. The characters did nothing for me and I just found it boring. Nothing interested me enough and I had to force myself to read farther.I am always seeing books being compared the Dresden Files so I finally decided to see what all the fuss is about. I still dont know! I don't know how such a mediocre book got such high ratings. I just found it plain boring and I really did not care at all what happened.If this is his best work I will not be reading the rest of this series or any more of Jim Butchers work. I am always looking out for a good series in this genre, but this definitely isn't one of them."
1,Up is so overrated I can't believe it,"I've been a fan from early on as well and felt that the band hit its peak with New Adventures (feh to you naysayers) and needed to stop with the records. I think New Adventures is their best Warners album and strikingly evokes sounds and moods from their entire career. Now there's Up, a tired hung-dog collection of played-out random verbalizing from some once scrappy musicians now leading the good life. They needed to take some more time off, get over themselves, and find some drummer that they could just jam with. Lotus hints at some new mellow funky sound but the rest is just dull prog-rock noodling."
1,Not worth the money,"This is a poor atlas I will not buy ""Benchmark"" in the future. I bought this one because I thought it would show more (it had a newer publication date). The DeLorme Atlas and Gazetteer is much better for explorers, hikers, ghost towners, sportsment, hunters, fishermen etc."
1,Speculative pseudo-history at its worst,"The mystery of Rennes-le-Chateaux is undoubtably facinating, but that's no excuse for producing something as poor as this. It's by now totally discredited (I saw it described as a ""notorious hoax"" in the Observer a while back), especially since being torn to shreds by TimeWatch (a British History program), during which the authors were shown to have not made any attempt to check some of the most basic facts underlying their theories. Strictly for the gullible."
1,Stopped working 15 months later,"I did my research on heating pads and this pad was ranked very highly and had great reviews. I was trying to use up my FSA money before year-end and chose to spend the money on a good quality pad. I would use this pad at night time, placing it under my upper back. It worked great and I liked the auto shut-off feature (although i wish it maxed out at 120 min instead of 60). I didn't one it all the time either, probably 50 times throughout 15 months. Last week, I tried to turn it on and it crapped out on me! There was no damage to the cord, the pad, the remote - it just stopped working! I called the manufacturer and they have a strict 1 year warranty policy. So now I'm SOL. I guess I'll just buy a sunbeam from CVS. At least then when it craps out after a year, I won't feel as bad having bought a cheaper product.To sum up: It was nice while it lasted!"
1,Harry Potter and the Haunted House,"I went to see this one with my wife's family thinking that it actually looked like a decent horror movie, I was terribly disappointed. They completely failed to develop or deliver any plot which is made all the worse by the fact that the book is actually decent. If they had stuck to that plot this could have been a good movie.*Spoiler*The entire movie is, he goes upstairs to see what that noise was, then back downstairs to continue reading papers. This repeats for an hour and a half. The end."
1,Buyer Beware - Amazon can and will delete books remotely,"I was thinking about getting a kindle for the convenience of being able to carry multiple books and newspapers with me at once, but there is NO WAY I would even think about buying one now that Amazon has decided it is entitled to remotely delete purchased content from Kindles. Once I buy a book, electronic or hard copy, I expect to own it."
1,cracked case,"I don't think this is in ""good condition"" as the seller claimed. The case is cracked and very sharp. I have to be careful when I open the case."
1,NOT RECOMMENDED,"This item was a disappointment from day one.It lasted about 3 weeks before it broke.I had hoped it would be a good gift,but not so in this instance."
1,pathetic copy,"The new CD of Jarabe de Palo is great. A new refreshing style that reminds me the 80s Madrid pop-rock, with influences from Los Ronaldos. The sound quality is good but after a few minutes of the end of the last song, a ranchera sounds! It seems this CD has been recorded on top of an older CD...unacceptable. Also the title is wrong! Let's copy it right: AdelantAndo. I will never buy a CD from Warner latino again."
1,All the funny scenes are already in the trailer!,"After watching this movie, I realized all the funny scenes are already in the trailer! The rest of the movie is boring. This is one of the worst film staring Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan.It's still worth renting so that you can compare it with the other two installments."
1,A WASTE!!,"This movie should have been much better! The story line is week, besides the sexy actor the movie was a waste! This movie should be on Lifetime."
1,Video didn't play at all,I tried 5 times and video didn't play at all. Horrible experience. Need my refund so I can better watch a movie which is available for watch
1,Truly Awful,"I teach a Data Structures course and this book was thrust upon me by previous instructors. Book is full of code: much of it very poorly written...I censored much of it before showing to students. Some code I left as is to show them examples of bad programming practices. The little ""analysis"" contained in the book is misleading and sometimes wrong. The lack of rigor is appalling. Maybe a good choice for high-school students, otherwise avoid this book!"
1,great multitool but it was very used when i got it,DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER!!! the tool seems durable but as soon as i took it out of the box i noticed it was used. dirt in crevices and some kind of brown stuff in the teeth of the pliers. is this legal? for someone to tell you that this is new and sell you something that is clearly used? the tool is fine but the seller is a con artist. dont buy from the seller. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER!!! this maybe the last time i buy off amazon. no quality control!!
1,Disappointed First Time Mom,"I was so excited about this product when I saw it at [baby site] ,I immediately registered for it. I have 3 more months until our little girl arrives, however this product arrived in the mail today. To say I'm disappointed is an understatement. I thought this would a handy little travel wipes pack I could place in my diaper bag. I was wrong. The cord that you have to plug in to keep the wipes warm is too short to even wrap around the case. Out of the 50 + things that I registered for this one is going back!!!"
1,A bit of a disappointment,"It's refreshing to see that books are now being published about dinghy cruising. Throughout his trip Lee was very good at regularly updating the Canadian Wayfarer website about to his exciting trip and I had anticipated a really good book to be the end result. This was not the case though as I found his book to be of little merit from a ""sailor's point of view"" and falters to nothing more than a glorified log-book by a rookie sailor who quite frankly is lucky his inexperience on such an ambitious trip didn't kill him.This book is defintely NOT to be used as a reference guide for dinghy cruisers."
1,A collection of papers on workflow.,"Some good, most useless. One must dig deep to get any valuable nuggets from this one. The second half of the book is the WfMC interface specifications which doesn't appear to be any different than the specifications that can be accessed on-line, though the on-line specifications are newer and a little more up-to-date (which causes one to wonder why 1997 is in the title though there hasn't been an update to the specifications since 10/96 and the book doesn't reflect the later changes....)"
1,A little too contrived and shallow!,"This is the first of Diane Mott Davidson's book that I have read and it will probably be my last one. I find her characters shallow and unrealistic. The plot of the mystery is confusing with too many extraneous characters, all with some prior relationship to the detective/cater Goldy. Most of her sleuthing is done in the middle of the night as she is unable to sleep. Is it believable that her cop husband sleeps through her midnight detective work with only a mild reprove to Goldy after the fact? I haven't tried the recipes but hopefully they are better than the mystery."
1,Disappointing,"Initially, I was very happy with these, as I have been with Timberland in the past.However, within a few months, 3 or so, the stitching between the canvas and leather (or faux-leather) came apart on both boots. This is unacceptable in a boot from a brand like Timberland for the price. I expect better quality, and will not likely be buying Timberland again anytime soon. I can get better quality cheaper.On the upside, the boots are comfortable...until it rains or snows. Wet feet are NOT comfortable at all, and once the stitching splits, they are no longer waterproof. Haven't had any issues with traction, but as I got them in the spring and they had begun to fall apart by the summer, I have limited experience with them on snow or ice."
1,Do yourself a favor,"I urge all of you to use this study guide in addition to other history and social science study materials. The book does cover a lot of the exam material but this exam is worth 6 credits and you want to be prepared as possible. I scored a 61, but that was with a lot of studying."
1,boring but classic,This book was extremely boring but I would understand how some people would like it since it is an all time classic. I am 3/4 of the way done and I hope that it gets better than it is now.
1,Smell don't last,Well I gave it a star because the bottle looks nice but other then that . I think I got a fake bottle smell don't last no more then 5 hrs I men for the price this thing should last all day if its the original but next time I'm just gonna go to joe brand and pay 250.00 for the real thing.
1,Nice looking rubber hose but kinks like crazy,I have had black rubber hoses from other manufacturers that were stiff but flexible and resisted kinking. This hose is definately not one of those. Although the description describes it as having a thick and durable wall it is not very stiff at all. In the first few minutes of using it about 10 kinks developed that totally stopped all water flow. You need to carefully lay out the hose before use and watch constantly that you don't twist it since kinks form with the least provocation. All in all I wish that I had bought another Craftsman brand black rubber hose that I have for the front of my house since that almost never kinks.
1,Huh......,"Many people who enjoy this player seemed like they had never operated one before. Of course the ESP would work if you ""smack it or even drop it"". Do you have any idea how ESP works, obviously not. It is stored in an electronic memory for 40 seconds (or whatever) until the song gets to that part. By dropping a player, you physically can't delete this information. ESP - >>Electronic Skip Protection. I say get the $70 ones."
1,Out of Date,This book is very out of date. We had to use it for Women's Health for the FNP track. I have almost 5years of experience in Labor and Delivery and was shocked our school would recommend such an out of date text. There has to be better options. I checked out an AWHONN book from the school library and it was much more helpful. The information on each topic is minimum and insufficient to learn from. Recommended treatments are out of date and have changed significantly in many situations. They are also not specific enough. OLD OLD OLD! It may work for the lay person just trying to learn a bit about the patho behind women's care and health issues.
1,Does the story NO justice,"I saw this movie twice. The first time I didn't like it at all. Then I read the book (which is EXCELLENT) so I decided to give the movie another try. Collin Farrell captured Bobby's character very well, but without reading the book you wouldn't know this. The movie could have been done so much better, it gave absolutely no insight to these characters. Each one, Jonathan, Bobby, Clare and Alice are so complex as are their relationships with one another. The movie doesn't show this at all. Alice, one of my favorite characters in the book comes off totally different in the movie. It's so hard to establish these things in a movie, but this was a very poor attempt."
1,Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,"I am such a sucker for ""buzz"" and ""critically acclaimed"". Bill Murray's performance is quirky at best (a reviewer's word was ""understated"") and the plot, such as it was, took nearly an hour to develope enough so you could see kinda where things were going.Meander is what this film does. The Murray character's life is disintegrating and Scarlett Johansson's character, Charlotte, has been ditched by her photographer husband. They meet in the hotel bar and it's all down hill from there--which wasn't far to go.This is a pretentious piece of crap that only got recognition because Sofia's father is Frances Ford Coppola."
1,I wish I hadn't read it,"Sister of My Heart is one of my all time favorite books--I love everything about that book and that is why I was so excited to discover the Divakaruni wrote a sequet to it. But after reading it I wish I had not. Yes, it was nice to have so many of the questions, left over from the first book, answered but this book ruined the characters for me.My review of it has nothing against Divakaruni as a writer, she is extremely talented and gifted but I hate where the story ended up. I also hated that I no longer cared for the characters. Overall I found it to be just ordinary and almost forced.As far as this book is concerned I would have liked to be left in the dark."
1,Ugh,"I knew I was getting a quick read with this book, but dear Lord I practically just flipped the pages till I got to the end just to get it over with. It started just fine, but after the main guy got hurt it just went downhill. This was the first book I have read by this author and honestly probably won't read another. Very disappointing :("
1,Not Good at All,"Confusing and impassable. Think I'm talking about NYC traffic? No, this was the Crystal Key. In my opinion, this was the worst game I have ever played! I couldn't even get past the first ""land"", even after following two walkthroughs! The plot didn't make sense, and wasn't exactly great. I would advise to play the real Myst instead, instead of some spinoff trying to live up to Myst."
1,New design is NOT durable.,"It works ok as a pet door. If you had a very slow feeble dog it might last longer. Any wind over ~10mph will hold the door open as the magnetic latch will not reliably catch after a pet goes through.I have purchased three, the last one of these doors just gave up, after about 10 months use by our four dogs. The first one that we purchased was several (about 7 years) ago. It lasted nearly five years with continuous heavy use by three very active terriers. The hinge pivots finally wore out and let the door jam against the frame. I noticed that the replacement (same staywell model) was much lighter and of different design. The new design lasts about 6 to 10 months. If this was a $15 product, this would be acceptable, at $40 to $50 it is not.Find different manufacturer."
1,I had to return this vacuum cleaner and the replacement,"The vacuum cleaner I ordered picked up the dirt and spit it back out. Amazon gave me no trouble at all in getting a replacement and returning the defective one. Unfortunately, the replacement had the same broken part that the original did. Very disappointing, especially since it was supposed to be a commercial model."
1,don't waste your money,"This is by far the worst detector I have ever had.Does not detect even close signals. Had it in for repair twice, still does not work properly.Gives great false signals and makes a fine [although expensive]door stop."
1,Spam for vegetarians,"That's the only thing I could think of when eating this. The texture, the taste, the ""gravey"" that it comes in. It's just not that good. It's just not for me."
1,If you're looking for Gary Forney performing....,"....this ain't it. Most of the tunes are performed by David Fox...the guy in ""Off The Charts""."
1,"Is it just ME, or what?","Is it just me, or what? Am I the only one that wonders how you can sell something with NO picture, NO description or NO reviews?I'm interested in this, but I have NO idea what I would be getting.PLEASE,GIVE ME SOMETHING TO GO BY."
1,does not work accurately,"I was looking forward to using the Dimension Pro. However, I am returning it. Perhaps I got a defective one but this device can not produce accurate measurements. I have tried repeatedly to use it on walls that I know the distance between and it simply does not display an accurate reading."
1,poorly made,Buttons that lock the brush into the extension wand don't secure well so brush slips off. Not worth the trouble to return so I get what I paid for - cheaply made product.
1,Don't Buy It,"My boyfriend ordered this pendant for me for Valentine's Day. What they sent him is 5mm longer (leaving more space between the diamonds), and I think it's actually only .1 carat, rather than .15. Maybe they sent the wrong thing, or maybe they're being dishonest."
1,This one is going to be a dust collector,"A little background on me first. I do weight training (ie P90X and etc), dance, and yoga. So what I like is pretty varied. I really didnt overly like this video at all. The best pro about this one was the set, which was absolutely beautiful. The second pro was the stretch sequence, it was a pretty good sequence. The rest of it, was very slow and dull. My mind drifted a lot during the DVD. And if you are drifting you are not concentrating on the muscles being used, so it kind of becomes pointless. Also, the narration didnt match the exercises. They would stop moving and then the voiceover would say to stop. This video is not going to be my go to video."
1,On moonlight bay.,This video stopped right in the middle of the movie...had to fast nforward after yhat part to see the rest of the movie...not cool...
1,Not for self study,"Yes, this book has lots of problems. That's all. It is a book for those who already know the theory, and definitely not for self study. And it's also very confusing when trying to explain some concepts."
1,Not today,"Five crime stories. I read the first. Damn, ain't no way to solve the thing until you read the last page, and I waded through all kinds of cardboard cutouts and cliches to get there. I quit reading."
1,Lame,"Snoozer of a movie. I was looking forward to this, based on the fact that Samuel L. Jackson was in it. However, even he couldn't make this predictable movie interesting."
1,Pride and Prejudice,This DVD was not in good form (did not work). I returned the DVD requesting a new copy. I was informed that you are refunding my money less a discount. I have requested info as to why the refund is not for the full amount and have not heard anything.
1,SAME OL WIGGER STUFF,"This aint nothin new & I cant believe it still sells. So some white kid learned that he got attention sayin ""f"""""""". That was somethin new in the late 60's. Give me a break. This guys another 20 nothin that will be a 40 nothin b4 your very eyes."
1,Cable for A870,The description for the USB Sync Data Cable includes the Samsung A870. This particular cable does not fit the A870 and should not be purchased if you wish to transfer data between your A870 and a computer. Check the Samsung website for the appropriate cable #.
1,Leather Case Very Disappointing,"WARNING!!! Can not use button features to operate Zen player because leather case is way too tight! You can hardly get the player into the case so no amount of time or breaking in period is going to fix the problem. Sadly, it's like having a pair of shoes that are so tight you have to remove them so you can walk. [...]"
1,"Promises a lot, but doesn't deliver","This book promises original ideas, and new information, but I studied it at great length, and couldn't find anything I hadn't read elsewhere, or hadn't found more informatively and better presented in numerous other better-known books. This book is really a disappointing rehash of things you can find in other, better books. You'd be better to read Andrew Weil or Larrian Gillespie's books on diet and nutrition, or even Barry Sears' Zone books, than this one."
1,are you afraid of trees,what a joke...still want to write to the movie theater and ask for my $4.00 back. Absolute insulting drek!
1,Absolutely unoriginal,"Unless you are Rip van Winkel who went to sleep in 1959, or under 13, just race through the book and see whether you notice anything you haven't seen at least 10 times before. Occasional insights, churned out by a competent hack."
1,Don't spend your money!!,Not very good. Acting not great. Dragged on. There are many other Christmas movies to spend your money on.
1,"Too Righteous, Too Bad","""Do not be too righteous, and do not act too wise; why should you destroy yourself? Do not be too wicked, and do not be a fool; why should you die before your time? It is good that you should take hold of the one, without letting go of the other; for the one who fears God shall succeed with both"" (Ecclesiastes 7:16-18)."
1,Tiny and overpriced,"tiny little things and so overpriced it's ridiculous. I didn't realize the size when I purchased. In addition, they are 1/5 the price in Home Depot."
1,A lip gloss that tinggles,"Wont buy it again. Nothing special about it, tinggles for a little while. No plumping. Nothing that any other lip gloss can't do."
1,Does not pump grease. What is it for then?,This tool is not usable. The pump suction feed fails whenever you try to use it. I am using synthetic bearing grease and it will not pump it. I think it was designed for use with melted butter maybe? The grease fitting on the end of the hose will not fit standard zerk fittings. I replaced it with one from my manual pump in order to test this thing. The bleeder valve is actually a suction breaker. If you do get the grease pumping under no pressure situation (through an open zerk) it will stop when you push the bleeder valve. I replaced the bleeder valve with a plug to insure it was not opening during the test. I would never buy this product again and I am surprised it is still on the market.
1,A Waste of Time and Money,"There is very little point in seeing this DVD. We are told ""Also included are snippets"" [of some of Sellers' rarely seen works]. Snippets is the right word, they are tiny. His unknown works will still be unknown to you after seeing this. The only things we really see are his TV ads. The script is dull and uninformative. It didn't cost much, but still wasn't worth the price."
1,You won't be Dazzled!,"I purchased the Dazzle Video Creator in hope of transfering my analog vhs tapes into a digital format. It was a neat idea, a plug and play option that I could install without opening the computer case. Great idea, right?Well, this is where everything goes wrong. After istalling the software bundle and getting the Dazzle up and running I ran into severe problems. Mainly being the computer just wouldn't recognize the audio or sound files. Hey, no problem I'll just call tech support to get this ironed out. Much to my dissatisfaction I found out thier tech support was almost nonextistant. They never and let me repeat never helped me at all ever to get this problem ironed out.So save your dough and buy a real video capture card and save your money or you could end up let me with a totally worthless piece of junk that don't work."
1,HUNTER/KILLER A BUST,"As a huge fan of Patrick Robinson, I was greatly disappointed by his latest, ""Hunter/Killer"". It spent half the book setting up the ""bad guys"" mission (which is what I expected), but when it came to the rebuttal from the US of A, it was as if Robinson decided that to do it right would make for too long a book, so he hurried through it. What happened to the French President? Did the ships docked along the French Riveria ever get blown up?Did King Nasir go after the French Special Services for trying to assasinate his buddy? General Rashood played second to a new character - so I suppose the saga of him and Shakira is still to follow. Operation Tanker was a total ""shoot and run"" . There is normally more action taken by Morgan and the USA. To blow up France's tankers and escort was a good starting point, but come on, Patrick, you can finished much, much better than this!!!!"
1,"Those who left never really ""part of the fold"" to begin with","I bought this book hoping that it would provide a glimpse into why Mormons leave the LDS Church. While it did accomplish this objective in a limited sense, I was disappointed that include a majority of stories by what I consider to be ""cultural Mormons"" (born in the LDS Church but not practicing). I guess I was hoping for a view of Mormons who, after study and thought, left the church because of doctrinal differences, historical problems, and so on. Many in this book claimed that they had never read the ""Book of Mormon"" from cover to cover or had not read it seriously. So while the stories were interesting, many of the people in the book were never really ""part of the fold"" to begin with (head and heart -- never really ""converted"" to the Mormon faith)."
1,microwave egg poacher,"not sure what I think of this product...I have not reached the ""poached"" stage with it yet...I like egg white cooked and the yolk runny...so far ""well-done"" is the only stage I can find."
1,Interesting but not fullfilling,"I looked forward to this book quite a bit as Appollo was THE project when I was a young engineer. The book, while extensive, lacks details and explanation of most of the material."
1,doesn't receved !,i order it before more than month ago and it's not arrived to me yet !!this is bad company they not answer my emails and emaili sent to them more than one email and they didn't answering me !
1,this film is good for rest,this film is really bad.the look who's talking routine doesn't work here at all.Eddie is just walking thru this lame film.
1,Only read this if you want to re-read a few times..,"This book was boring, and poorly setup....It consists of too much stupid diction, and the tone fails it in many places.If you have to read this for a class, or are considering a form of suicide, then turn to this book.."
1,Poor quality DVD,"Poor instructor, tacky, jiggling camera, low budget, look at me not the prompter or off camera, poor sound quality, odd pauses and over all low budget low quality. Save your dollars for a better DVD."
1,"Should be titled ""How to Play and Win Less than you Lose""","John Patrick continues his misleading statements and his misuse of the word Win. This book does not overcome basic mathematics and the player disadvantage built into the game. Save your money and don't buy it; better yet, save even more money and don't play Baccarat."
1,this was a fake.,"was not the real product. my husband uses curve aftershave balm for years, but I always bought it in department stores. When I got this one one on amazon, it gives him skin irritation when he put it on . He tried few times just to make sure it was this product. so sad"
1,"Love the movie, hate this cut of it.","I can see I am not alone in my dislike of this DVD. As mentioned, this edition only comes in fullscreen, which I find annoying. The worst part has to due with the almost complete lack of cleaning the film; it looks like it was copied from the VHS.The sound was also sub-par, and obviously not mixed well. Considering I only paid nine bucks for it, I consider it a worthwhile purchase... My VHS is so worn that about half the movie is unwatchable. There are a couple of problems with the audio warping that was also not fixed in this edition.If you're like me (in the sense that you have a VHS in poor condition) and simply want a watchable version of this movie, then this cut shouldn't give you any problems. If you're a die-hard fan and want a bit more, go for the special edition. I hear good things, but have not seen it myself as of yet."
1,Loose dog!,"I bought a Hamilton collar of this style for a large dog. 120#. Chasing a squirrel in the park and coming to the end of the lead, the abrupt snap caused the steel ring to move up over the buckle and release the snap tabs. Voila! Loose dog!Not something you would want to happen around traffic or people who are afraid of dogs."
1,DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT,Have had a Sony Sports Walkman for many years-- going back to the yellow versions. I've noticed the quality has gone down. My walkman before this one lasted two years. Not bad. This one lasted 38 days before the tape player gave out. Guess all the R n D at Sony is going into other products. Go with a lower cost provider-- these are no longer the flagships of the Sports Walkman product line.
1,Don't bother paying extra for Blu-Ray,"I give this a 5 for the marvelous DTS soundtrack and a minus 1 for the horrendous video. For a group that is supposedly on the cutting edge of multimedia, the video on this blu-ray looks like one of my old VHS tapes from the early 90's. Dark, grainy, and off-color. I should know because I attended this concert. Having seen clips of the upcoming Springsteen dvd which is in true HD, I plan on returning this in exchange for that as soon as possible. What a shame. Wait for 2 months when this appears in the bargain bin at Walgreens."
1,"A little cheap, not made for commercial work","I am a professional cabinet builder, bought this saw in Sept. 2002, and have had trouble with the switch going out. The motor is no longer as powerful as it used to be either. I have bought a Makita now to try out for a few years and am selling this one while it still has a little life. I don't believe this saw is made for commercial work. Note, I have NOT abused this saw, it just has had a lot of use day in and day out."
1,It's not what you think,"I bought this book to add to my research of ETs in the Bible, but this book is not what the Title promises. It's just a rather short compilation of essays from the author about the possible connection, with just a few scriptures. I have seen way better through other authors who make the argument better through highlighting more scriptures. The concept is real though, but this author falls short on proving it."
1,You get what you pay for.,The solder sucker came with the blue plastic separated from the aluminum tube. The plastic threads were stripped and the two halves would not stay together. I used some JB Weld to permanently attach the two halves. After the repair the unit works ok.
1,????,"What a waste of time. This story sucked so bad. There was no point to it. You didn't care what happend next. It annoyed me so much when they whould have Christina Milian sing her songs all the way through. She would sing her first song all the way through then her Aerosmith duet, then her video, it was so friggn annoying to have to sit there for 3 minutes to here her sing. This isn't american idol. Every single thing about this movie sucked except for Andre 3000 who did a good job in his role."
1,flash2028,"I love this seriese and I'm trying not to take this book personally, but its hard. I feel bad for every person I have turned onto WOT. Jordan and his editor have managed to turn die hard fans against them. I've kept hope that some of the side plots hinted at in ealier books would be resolved eventually, while the main plot progresssed slowly. Its hasn't happened at all. It just keeps growing and going no where. My little brother is currenlty reading book six and is loving every word. I feel bad knowing whats in store for him. I would keep hope, but I can't fathom how Jordan could address everything he has introduced with out some spin off books. It is all such a dissapointment now. I'll probably wait until the series is finished before I read another book and then I'll spend as little money as posssible."
1,The Fat Joe Cd,I like this cd because i like the way Joe sings with this other lady I forgot her name though. But they both have a cute voice!...
1,It's pretty but it doesn't work,"iSi usually has good products which is why I bought their ice cream scoop. Although it looks nice and feels good in your hand, it will not scoop hard ice cream."
1,Wait... Donnie Darko is a 5* movie,"I've enjoyed movies likes this before, including Donnie Darko. Including Twin Peaks. The biggest distractions of this movie were (1) the glut of celebrities forgetting to play characters and instead were playing themselves and (2) the boring pace."
1,Don't waste your $,"It maybe helped my couch about 10-20%, I do have a deep couch though, so perhaps on a more shallow couch this product would work, although I tend to agree with the person who wrote, ""don't waste your money, just use a piece of plywood"", learn from my mistake, people! :)"
1,Skip it.,"One of your reviewers below notes that this guy has potential. People identified as having potential are generally those who haven't done anything yet. Therefore, I agree. ""Save Tonight"" is a stupid song delivered in monotone and everthing else is worse. For good current music, see Sheryl Crow, Sarah McLachlan or Carlos Santana. I liked no songs on this album so I give it zero stars even though it shows up as 1 star above. I save 1-star ratings for really bad albums that have a single hit on them like ""Sgt. Pepper""."
1,had to rewire both that i purchased.,"I was getting a light flicker, or issues with it just not turning on, and when i opened it up, I noticed that the wire was exposed from rubbing on the inlet hole. I opened the second one to find the same thing.. dangerous...I was able to cut and rewire them and no problems since.. I tossed one out in favor of a larger clip lamp from lowes which i would recommend over these due to the better quality, longer plug, higher wattage, and lower price."
1,Beyond Bad,"Like many others, I rented this movie because of Parker Posey who I loved in Waiting for Guffman, Clockwatchers and The House of Yes. Unfortunately, the character she plays in this film was pretty flat and uninteresting. I really didn't care what happened to anyone in the film. It was slow, long and some scenes just plain made me sick and I had to turn away. I fell asleep near the end (that's how thrilling it was), and I never do that. The whole storyline was unengaging and the dialogue was very tiresome and repetitive. This film lacked everything: a well written story, detailed character development and any semblance of purpose or direction. It relied on cheap meaningless scenes with vomit, diarrhea, sex, violence etc. Not all independent films are worth raving about."
1,Terrible Scent,"I've liked other scents from this company, but this one is terrible. It smells more like smoker's clothing. Nothing like a new car scent. This is going directly in the garbage."
1,Hogwash,"This book is fundamentalist hogwash. I'd only recommend something like this to illustrate how ignorance is dished out under the guise of ""educating"" christian children. This book is filled with lie after lie cleverly worded to help perpetuate ignorance and new age religious mythology. It doesn't deserve any stars."
1,"Bad Battery, disappointing",I really liked this shaver until the battery stopped holding a charge after about 11 weeks. I looked into buying a new battery but the cost of it didnt make sense. I am really disappointed in this product. It is a shame because the shaver is very good otherwise.
1,"what he said - gentle breeze, ridiculously horrible product","This product is ridiculous. It CANNOT suck up a spider or any other insect that can climb a wall or hang from a ceiling.As someone else said, the vacuum is super weak, gentle breeze at best. I don't write reviews ever. This is my first one, but I have to warn others. Do not buy this product.I get the feeling someone who feels sorry for insects designed it, to get back at those of us that want to kill them or remove them from our homes. Well you did it. Got my blood pressure up over the sorry fact that I wasted money on this product, and so here's your review."
1,A beautiful book spoiled by amateurish illustrations,"Don't even bother with this version. Get the Irene Haas illustrated book. The story is great, but the Irene Haas illustrations made it magical and unforgettable. It looks as if HBJ cheaped out on this version. I wonder if the paper and the binding is of a poorer quality as well."
1,Don't waste your money...,"I bought this tool to remove old caulk from a showr door that had been removed. Within 10 minutes the bottom edge broke off, then, while using the corner edge, that broke apart as well. as echoed in the other reviews, the edges do also become dull very quickly and was unable to finish trying to use the broken edge because it got too dull. went back to the store and bought a small, flexible putty knife. worked wonders and got a nice clean and close removal."
1,Terrible Product!!!,"We only use this blender occasionally for smoothies and it's always emitted a burnt rubber smell. My cousin told me that he had the same model, it also emitted a burnt rubber smell and eventually died. Mine still worked despite the smell. Today, I was making a smoothie and the smell got extremely bad. When I opened up the lid, puffs of smoke were coming out of the unit. I had to throw the smoothie out (which was only milk and banana) because the smoke ""traveled"" through the liquid to escape. This unit is going in the garbage and I will not be purchasing a Cuisinart again. Sad... I always thought this was supposed to be one of the better brands."
1,EMT Basic Exam Practice 4th Edition,"This book was not what i was expecting it to be at all. the questions were good for studying, but did not relate to the exam"
1,An Intense Read,"If you plan to read this book, set aside a day...it is a compelling story, page after page. The characters are well developed, making you really care about what happens to them, even with the fast pace. This book kept me up way past bedtime, too many nights, and even when I set it aside I was thinking of what might happen next. I really enjoyed this book, but will not read the sequels until I can devote a day to reading. Mr. Goodkind certainly knows how to tell a tale!"
1,Worst online support I have ever seen.,"Symantec's so-called customer service website is the most confusing, frustrating, bug-ridden, and unhelpful commercial website I've ever visited. And yes, I've been to Hewlett Packard's."
1,Not a techno thriller,This is more of a geo-political novel more than any kind of techo-thriller. The flying scenes are few and far between and there is way to much build up. I got 3/4 of the way through it and had to give up.
1,A dissenting opinion,"It seems like everyone liked the movie, but I found it very long, slow and full of sloppy sentimentalism. The good vs evil angle that the movie tries to take gets very tiresome - it gets preachy without being profound, with cheesy lines. The plot makes no sense. ""Moneyball"" was way more engaging, thoughtful and entertaining than this one."
1,Sometimes you get what you pay for,Purchased this so that both myself and the BF could charge our phones at the same time while on a trip. It worked great for about 6 months and the contacts have gotten *very* finnicky. Now have to wiggle it around to get it to charge properly. Was cheap enough that it's not too big a complaint though. This product is great to hold you over until you can buy a better one.
1,Disappointing,"Extremely disappointing. Bought the toy for my son for Christmas. It didn't come with the battery ($30 extra) and the battery is still sold out everywhere, including online, almost a month later.Don't bother. There are lots of other great RC toys out there."
1,Changed my mind.,"After reading the review from ""T. Phoenix, decided that I do not want to purchase this unit due to it's black level bug issue.I also want to be able to play the discs from other players in my home.H. MORGANZA"
1,Author with a VERY BAD ATTITUDE!,"I was very disappointed in this book. I have been looking for ideas for my wedding/handfasting and thought this sounded like it might have some good ideas. Boy, was I wrong! The author has a very negative attitude towards anyone who wants a Pagan wedding and is not a Coven initiate, let alone a solitary. She also makes very snide remarks about anyone who wants a Pagan wedding, but doesn't want the whole BWD (Big White Dress) format. Overall, I would rate this book lower than 1 star if I could. I definitely would NOT recommend it to anyone!"
1,Tough Read,"In 'Culture and Imperialism', Said describes Western Imperialism of the late 19th century through the literature of the time. Although I find this premise rather intriguing, the book left a lot to be desired for me, especially because Said's writing style is so complicated, that it makes the Internal Revenue Code appear as a leisurly read."
1,NIA 24,My dermatologist recommended this product for hyperpimentation. Haven't seen a difference so far and it's been a month.
1,So-so,"Athough the crows are indeed a good live band, the recording quality on this CD is still less than admirable. (ie) track 11"
1,What's the Fuss?,I don't understand the rave reviews of this book. I picked it as my read for my book club and was almost stoned to death by my peers who also thought this was the biggest downer in the history of mankind.
1,Zero stars is more like it!,This so called romance novel is nothing but 300 pages of a girl having her period and whining. Read only if you want to lose your lunch. The last chapter they finally have sex but then find out she was child molested. How does this ever get on the romance book list? Disappointment and waste of six bucks
1,"random, rote list not a good way to learn","Hungry for Korean listening materials, I bought level 2 of this 3-level set. It is boring and pointless to listen to an endless list of words uttered first in English, then in Korean. Worse for Korean learners of English is the random inclusion of articles ""the"" and ""an"" before nouns. I suppose the purpose is to distinguish nouns that take ""a"" and nouns that take ""an,"" but ""the curiosity"" is unnatural because this countable noun would need the article ""the"" only if modified by an adjective clause as in ""the curiosity that children show..."" The ""a/an"" distinction is easy to learn. It would make more sense to distinguish clearly between countable and uncountable nouns by using ""a"" before countable nouns and nothing before uncountable nouns.A companion CD to a textbook would reinforce language learned in the context of a thematic unit, but a random list is not a useful tool for increasing vocabulary.I will not buy any more Vocabulearn CDs."
1,As Bad as it Gets,"Go up to YouTube and search for ""Madeline Kahn"" and ""Clue"". Watch the clip called ""Flames on the side of my face"". It's only about a minute long, and once it's over you will have seen the only funny thing in this movie. ""Clue"" squanders an above average cast on a painful exercise in mugging and door-slamming that's like Mel Brooks on a really off day. Maybe it's a good movie for eleven year-olds who are also fans of the board game, but everyone else should stay away."
1,"Another, ""Glad I rented it!"" flick","This movie just plain sucks. Another, ""Glad I rented it!"". I can't return it to Blockbuster fast enough. I know this is not a helpful review but just wanted to vent! :-)"
1,Mopping Up,"My Pro Twist mop has a stiff brush at the bottom of the mop for hard to remove spots, stains and stuck on matter from tile floors. (My dogs are 18 and 15 years old and accidents happen.) I use my mop daily and it works beautifully without much effort at scrubbing so I ordered this refill and was very disappointed to find that there was no brush at the bottom but rather a small ""scuff eraser"" which will not do the job I need it to do and is not that great on scuff marks either. If this information had been included in the description, I would not have ordered it."
1,Major disappointment,"I chose to read this account of Markham's life based on other reviews here on Amazon, and I was sorely disappointed! The writing was awful. Sentences often did not make sense at all, and paragraphs felt like the had been cobbled together from different topics. The main idea of the book seems to be to list the amazing number of lovers that Markham had, and how she mooched off everyone around her. My advice would be to find a different biography, if you must read about her at all."
1,To Whom It May Concern,"Despite what Peter says, these may be by the original artists but they are NOT the original versions!"
1,product review,The product arrived in the prescribed time frame. However one of the dvd's was badly scratched and did not work. I realize it was a used item but I think they should have screened it and let people know that one of the dvd's was bad.
1,Disappointingly drab,"I had hoped for a detailed, accurate accounting with authentic pictures. This production was drab, uninteresting and with boring re-enactments. Not everyone viewed the Holocaust as a bad thing."
1,The Dark Tower series went from classic to rubbish in this entry.,"I love the first four books in this series, but when this crappy follow-up came out, I found that it sucks hard. The story is stupid and the writing is lame. Its garbage. Ignore this rubbish and stick with Dark Tower Novels 1-4."
1,TOO MELODRAMATIC,"Horrible movie,felt like kicking the VCR .Should be awarded the worst movie of the decade award."
1,"very lame,puts you to sleep","Another great musician,that thinks we want to see and hear an accoustic set.I wanted a DVD of a concert band but got an egotistical,{I'm great by myself,its me they love},load of self indulgence.I've seen him ""live"" twice,and own all his cd's,but this DVD is a waste of his time and my money.The DVD is not clearly advertised as an accoustic set,so don't waste your money."
1,The Book Is Flat,"I kept reading. Sooner or later, I kept telling myself, Friedman will tell me something I don't already know. Alas, it never happened. This book consists of 469 pages of stuff you can read in newspapers, in magazines, or experience personally every day. Is there anyone out there who has not yet had an experience with an Indian call center? Is there anyone who is not aware that increasingly high tech jobs, and even management jobs, are being outsourced, and that the USA is falling behind in math, science and engineering education? There may be a good 100 page book somewhere in all those pages trying to get out, but it is so buried underneath the commonplace it is hard to find. It's not that this is a bad book. It's just that most (all?) people who would read such a book should already know everything that Friedman talks about, and that most (all?) of those who would benefit from it would not be drawn to read it in the first place."
1,Not a quality product.,"I purchased two and each shows a different temperature (probably both wrong). The difference is greater than 2 degrees Fahrenheit. Obviously quality control does not exist. It seems that that paper part with those numbers are attached in a wrong position. Since it is in a closed glass cylinder, nothing one can do. If you are looking for acceptable quality, look elsewhere."
1,Lost interest about halfway,"Maybe it's me, but this book dragged on and on. I liked the beginning,but by the middle it became too repetitive for me. Who saw who in Dublin, who said what to who, who wore what. Like a movie that is too long, I think 100 pages could have been eliminated. How many times do we really have to hear about Angela's arthritic mother, or mrs. O'Brien looking tired? The limitations of Irish life in a small village in the 50's is very well done, as are the influences of Catholicism."
1,Worked until it didn't,"I had no problems with this brush for about 2 months. The quality of the hair seemed to be sufficient and provided a great lather. Unfortunately, after 2 months the whole wad of bristles fell out of the base :/Because of this, I can't recommend it. I'll pay the extra couple bucks for a higher quality one I suppose.EDIT: I just received the brush I ordered as a replacement:100% Black Badger Bristle Shaving Brush with Blue Wood Handle & Free Stand - From Parker Safety Razor, and it is leagues above my old Tweezerman brush. The bristles are much softer and hold water/lather so much more effectively. The difference is so distinct that I wonder if the Tweezerman brush might actually be boar's hair instead the fair superior badger hair!"
1,Charger did not work.,The charger did not work as advertised. It failed to provide enough power to even make calls when plugged in. Complete write-off.
1,Pseudo-intellectual Excrement,"This movie does prove a point. Two geniuses having a brilliant discussion on theoretical physics can be made into a boring film. Time travel has always fascinated me. This film does not. It is, in fact, the worst movie I have seen. Smart topic, dumb movie."
1,Some CD Player,Some CD's that play fine in my car but don't play on this player. Many CD(s)had tracks that play in my car and my old CD player but skips or won't play them even after cleaning the CD. The changer sounds really loud and cheap. The sound is good for the CD's it plays. I had a Sony CD player bought in 1996 and has traveled to asia three times and back and was great but started to random play so I naturally bought another Sony but this CD player maked me wonder about Sony. I returned it. The seller preformed great.
1,Poor choice,This is the third Sharp microwave (all this model) that I have purchased.The ONLY reason I have done this is that I have a built-in kit above a stove unit that only fits thus particular microwave unit. Don't buy one.
1,Not What I Needed,"There was nothing wrong with this item, but it was not what I need. I returned it and have purchased a more extensive PE-Design program, so that I can do more than just download designs."
1,Not Worth the Money,"I've heard amazing things about the Chi flat irons, so when my cheap Conair flat iron broke, I chose to spend the money on this straightener. It worked fine for a while, but after 3 months it stopped working completely. There's no warranty for the product if it's bought online, so it was a waste of money. I went to Target and bought a T-Studio Tourmaline Digital Straightener and it works better than my Chi, has temperature control, and has a 4-year warranty. The Chi definitely wasn't worth the money that I spent for the short amount of time it worked."
1,Boring!,"I disagree with most of the other reviews, this book was a cheap rip off of Mist of the Avalons. It was so boring."
1,Jackass 3,"I recently purchased Jackass 3 without having seen it first. I most say that I was disappointed with the third Jackass movie. Some of the gags are rehashed from the first two movies, both of which were pretty funny, but with Jackass 3 it feels like something is missing. I thought the gags were funnier when they were done on the unspecting public like the party boy gag on the first movie. Things just don't come across as funny the third time around. Rent this one before you buy it!"
1,Pete Kelly's Blues,"I just can't believe that with all the rubbish movies that are released on DVD for no obvious reason, that classics like ""Pete Kelly's Blues"" can be over-looked for them.Why do Studio's continue to ignore the demands of movie fans who want quality classic movies. ""Lonely Are The Brave"" with Kirk Douglas is another prime example."
1,Didn't work for me!,"I followed this plan RELIGIOUSLY for over 8 weeks and I gained 7 pounds, mostly around my belly and face! I bought everything on the shopping list, some items were never even used in the recipies! This book contradicts itself several times about 'eating before working out, or eating after working out', '3 alcoholic drinks per week, or 2 per day', etc, etc. The other thing I found frustrating was the fact that most of the recipes if followed directly (which I thought was the idea!) are for 4 servings, so I found myself eating the same thing a lot, or a ton of leftovers and wasted food.I'm just very disappointed and don't recommend it, but then again, everyone's bodies are different so I hope it works for others!(P.S. a friend of mine tried it and had the same problem.)"
1,Clogging issues with planers,"Out of the box, the unit would clod very quickly when attached to a planer taking 1/16 of a 4"" board (something a 650 CFM dust collector should not have a problem with). The problem is caused by a crossbar in the 4"" inlet which appears to have been added to prevent someone from sticking there hand up into the impellers. Longer shavings from the planer get caught on the bar and then in turn help catch later pieces. I could probably be sued for suggesting people fix the problem the way that I did, so instead I would suggest the slightly more pricy JET which does not have a crossbar. Another reviewer went up in size instead and I think that is probably overkill for most small, single operator, shops."
1,What a misguided book!,"A lot of people consider this book a classic on social movements, but it provides no new research, offers no concepts original to McAdam, and sets up strawman opponents. Why is it still in print?"
1,arrived late but good condition,"I received this a week later than estimated for delivery. I contacted the seller and she verified it was sent out weeks prior. We couldn't understand where it was. Once I received the book, it appeared the seller had written the wrong zip code for my address and it was MIA in the postal system for awhile. The book was in good condition when received"
1,Excellent music - poor recording quality,"I was disappointed by the recording quality of this CD. The sound is very flat and muffled. Compare ""Cali pachanguero"" from this album to the same track on Grupo Niche's Serie Azul Tropical CD and you'll find that the latter has an audibly cleaner sound. I'd also recommend Greatest Salsa Classics (of Colombia) Vol. 1 instead of this CD. That album features Joe Arroyo's ""Pa'l bailador"" and ""Rebelión""."
1,Not very good Hackett,"I was surprised with this CD by Hackett. It is not what I expected from an ex-Genesis member. The recording is not good either. There are moments when one cannot hear the lyrics...! Too bad, Steve..."
1,disapointment,"I must admit that I bought this album because of Charlie Hunter's participation. I'm a big Hunter fan and I'd read and heard good things about clark. I must say though that the album is disapointing. Charlie Hunter only takes one solo, but that's not what bugs me. It's the artist that do solo that bug me. Clark and Hunter do fine on the album, but none of the horn players who take most of the solos are particularly exciting. If you want some good funky jazz, I recomend checking out the Charlie Hunter Trio or the original quartet or some of Scofield's latest efforts like A Go Go, Bump, & Uberjam (all of these artists' albums are quite good though, these are the funky ones). However, if you're used to the likes of Karl Denson, Stanton Moore, or any of those types, you might like this album, and I don't say this to dis' Denson or Moore."
1,KitchenAid SNPA Pasta Maker Plates for Food Grinder,"I wish I hadn't of bought this. I read another review where they said smoke was coming out of their mixer. I thought towards the end of making pasta with these attachments, that mine too would burn up the motor. I have the pasta rollers and cutters. More expensive but soooo much easier to work with and less stress on your mixer."
1,terrible,"What do I say?No point, nothing fun to do(except pick weeds), and the music drives me crazy.Dont get it, not worth it.Dont even borrow it from a friend. Personally, you couldnt pay me to play this game(unless youre you willing to pay...then we'll talk)"
1,Nice sweater- RUNS Small!,I like the sweater- but I am not impressed. I have a 39pd female boxer (puppy) and this just about fits her. I knew she would out grow it but I didn't expect it to be too small (now) plus she has only worn it once and the sweater all ready has a pull in it. I also purchased a fleece jacket elsewhere & that was a better buy- it fits big as it should for this size and NO pulls plus its water proof. As I said the sweater is nice but not really for doggy daily use. go with a water proof fleece jacket I don't think this was worth my money
1,Unger's Bible Dictionary (Kindle),"I have the hardcover which is excellent. I just received this on my Kindle online and am very disappointed because you cannot go to a particular word or topic. You can only go to the first letter in the word and then have to go page after page to find the particular word or topic you want. This is very unsatisfactory and defeats the purpose of a dictionary to look up a particular word or topic. The alphabet needs to expand and have the first two letters (aa, ab, ac, ad, etc.). This would cut the search time and would make the online dictionary useful."
1,Jude could have done MUCH better,"I was extremely disappointed with this book. The first book in the forever series was intriguing, suspenseful, and had just the right amount of romance. I was anxious to read Forever & Always because I thought it would be just as good if not better than Forever. Wow, was I wrong! This book was horrible! It focused way too much on racism and the story itself was choppy. I'm not sure if I'll be getting the next book in the Forever series because, frankly, if it's as bad as this one, I don't want to waste my money!"
1,"Disjointed, tedious and boring.","This book became too tedious after about 100 pages. Although some concepts in this book are interesting, the writing style is all about lots of parallel plot lines, interspersed with disjointed ""news"" and ""net"" clips. It's very predictable and became boring quickly."
1,Here's a fun game for the folks who liked this book:,"Look through the entire book and see if you can find a metaphor. I only read the first 23 pages, but I figured that if I didn't see one by then, the metaphor would be as hard to find as a sober college student at the homecoming tailgate party. That a novel so devoid of LITERARY INSIGHT can live on the bestseller rack for months should tell us how much we missed in high school English class. -J. A. Kemp, Jr."
1,Oxygen Sensor not compatible,"Made Kia Rio run horrible. Ordered and installed one made by NTK, I believe to be the OEM supplier and that solved the problem."
1,Too far along to quit,"After about 600 pages, I realized that I was not having any fun reading the book, but I was too far along to quit. Clancy's best novels (Red Storm Rising and Clear and Present Danger to name two) were filled with action and suspense, not chapter long diatribes about such issues as abortion, population control and domestic politics. I see that Clancy is trying to move in a different direction with his writing, but it just comes of as contrived and preachy. Until he returns to his former style, I will be passing on all his future books."
1,Tears your skin up,"This is the worst electric razor I've ever bought. I don't have sensitive skin but it still nicks my skin. The directions tell you NOT to use it on your underarms. I now know why, it will kill you. I can't even shave my thighs with it without getting cuts. The only place I can use it is from my knees to my ankles. I definately would not recommend this razor."
1,If only negative stars were possible,"This movie is horrible. It's like sitting with your elderly relatives who talk of nothing but the way things used to be, except the reminiscences in the movie hold none of the value that your relatives' stories carry. Layered on top of the endless ""remember whens?"" is mediocre singing performances and Virginia Madsen wandering around the set like she's got amnesia. I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone."
1,Big Dropoff,"There is a huge dropoff in quality from Vol 1. of the Whistle Test clips to this package, simply because there is a huge dropoff in the quality of the artists between the two volumes. Sorry, but Loggins and Messina, Average White Band, Jim Croce, Hall & Oates, Thomas Dolby and Simply Red just don't match up to Bill Withers, Captain Beefheart, Talking Heads, XTC, Iggy Pop and the Specials. The commentary from the show's hosts and the various musicians is still enjoyable and enlightening, as on the first collection, and this whole volume is almost made worthwhile simply for the stunning clip of the sublime Judee Sill sitting at the piano and painfully/beautifully singing her majestic ballad. And Jools Holland is a lot of laughs, both when talking about the Squeeze clip that is included and in the clip itself. So there's some nice moments here, but I really don't want to own anything that includes Loggins and Messina on it."
1,This is NOT a text book.,"Let me reiterate, this is not a textbook. It's a collection of interviews with people have designed new/different things. It teaches nothing about proper designing and brainstorming. It might be inspriring, but it has no real use as far as teaching/learning goes."
1,Cheap garbage,"I specifically chose this one because there's no plastic parts. When it arrived, I found that the part inside (that the crank threads into) is plastic. It stripped out after just two turns, which is the recommended amount in the instructions. I got a refund, but I'm out the $5 for shipping."
1,More of the same intelligent design nonsense...,"Johnson sounds better than most intelligent design creationists, I'll admit, but at heart his arguments are the same that have been trotted out for years. I suggest reading Robert Pennock's new book _Tower of Babel: The Evidence against the New Creationism_ for a devastating critique of Johnson's position."
1,Not what is pictured,I ordered this and received plain batteries without the housing that is needed for our dog collar. The picture is WRONG
1,can't really be objective,This is the second copy I've ordered and haven't received one yet that works!!! I know the show is GREAT because I saw it on DIRECTV but I seem to not be able to purchase a copy that I can watch in the comfort of my home whenever I want to. The moment I insert the disc into my BluRay it flashed INVALID!!!!
1,Mostly A Lesson In Native American History,I have enjoyed several novels by this author but not this one. It is mostly a lecture on the injustices committed against the Native American peoples and that got boring. I saw no real romance here and no reason why Kola would have fallen in love with Heather. Ms Eagle would have been better served if she had written a dissertation on the hardships forced upon the Native Americans than by writing this boring novel. Skip this one.
1,Yuck,Smelled cloying .... not a scent I would prefer at anytime ... storm or not. Don't do it ... unless you enjoy really off smelling sweetish smells.
1,Not a Fighter,"I re-read this book from my childhood and I'm very disappointed with particular messages Madeleine presents to children. I think enough has been said about stars (angels?) being conceived as witches to ""play a joke"" on everyone and the centaur appearance of the other ""angels"". No matter what the rest of the story conveys, I am completely revulsed by the notion she presents that Jesus was a fighter. He is not a fighter, but represents peace & love spreading the word of the Father on this earth for all to follow. Also, Jesus has already won the battle for us. All of these ignorant statements in this book by Madeleine need to be pulled before I will even think about looking at this book or sharing it with others."
1,Failed after 2 month,"I want to suggest any potential buyer to stay away from this washer. It is a crap. I agree that it washes very well, but the drying capability is handicapped(does not dry the plates completely) and the worst part! It failed to work after only 2 month of normal usages. One day it just stopped working, and I am trying to contact the customer support right now, and it appears that the people answering the phone is in India and I have to wait for someone else to call me back in US. Not sure how long it will take.... Wish me good luck! and for thouse of you who has not yet purchased this washer, STAY AWAY!"
1,For trivia buffs only,"Isaac Asimov is unquestionably one of the greatest science fiction writers of the 20th century. Unfortunately, his attempts at writing mysteries did not produce the same quality of work as his efforts in SF. TALES OF THE BLACK WIDOWERS demonstrates this with puzzle after puzzle that requires knowledge of trivia (the references are sometimes painfully obscure) rather than logical deduction to solve. Trivial Pursuit players might enjoy these stories but fans of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and Agatha Christie should pass on them."
1,warning,"The last three chapters of these books point are missing from the book. These cover some advanced firefox programming. There are instructions to go to the web site but the chapters are no where to be found.This is a first time I have seen such a thing and am not sure I like it. Why have three enticing chapters mapped out in the table of contents and then say they are not in the book you bought but on the web? And to add insult to injury the chapters are not there either. It might of been better to leave them out of the TOC to avoid misleading and just say that additional material is available at the authors site.Perhaps, this was just a unintentional logistic slip up that may soon be fixed but you have been warned."
1,Japanese Goosebumps!,"This film is $7.50 at walmart! The Japanese Goosebumps! Twilight Zone wannabes! Yeah, it's good. Good to laugh at! The Sacrafice should have been packaged alone for $1.50; I would have been satisfied!"
1,spring has already broke,I have four boys and one who is interested in kicking and the spring broke only after a couple of uses. would purchase a different product next time.
1,inoperable,the Chip was new in original factory sealed but it does not work. my phone or computer can not read it...
1,What grilled chicken?,The cover of this book shows a delicious grilled chicken recipe. But it's a slow cooker cookbook. Nowhere in the book does it give the recipe noting the cover image. I ordered the book based on that. Very disappointed.
1,Don't waste your money....,This book is VERY general and does not really give any worthwhile information to someone looking to convert a bus. The price on this book is absolutely outrageous for what it is - beware DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!! I ordered a couple other books from Dave Galey as well that were just as uninformative. I always come away wondering if this guy ever has even converted a bus or just spoke generally with a couple guys who have. If anyone gets a conversion done and feels like writing a book you'd do reall well selling it cuz this guy did terrible.
1,"Hmmm, there could be better books aout Leonardo","Maybe just try another book; I bought this one but since it's boring to read, I haven't read more than 5 pages."
1,Need Help!,"I bought this game after playing the free demo versions of all the MCF games online, but it crashes and freezes almost immediately after launch. I have updated my flash player, shockwave, and have all the Microsoft updates. Any suggestions? The game is useless as it is."
1,Don't Bother,"Black Lace books are supposed to have interesting plots and exciting sex scenes. This book has neither. Oh sure, the heroine, who isn't really all that likeable, has lots of sex. She'll sleep with almost anybody at the drop of a hat. However, there's not a lot of detail in the sex scenes and who cares anyway since Maddie and the reader never get to know anything about any of her partners. There is no buildup, no getting to know any of the men and hoping she will get together with them soon.I read all the Black Lace books, so obviously, I'm not a prude, but I couldn't like Maddie because she was such a slutty woman. I guess the reader is meant to find her near public sex acts daring and titillating. I just found her unsympathetic and got bored by the lack of detail and character development."
1,OK Until Something Breaks,"This machine has been used moderately for about a year and a half. Right after the warranty ran out, it started making squeaking noises inside. I took the machine apart, reduced the tension on the flyweel and the squeak went a way. However, this did change the tension settings.THEN, the rod that holds the right foot arm broke. After examining the broken part, it was obvious that it was poorly designed and/or manufactured. It broke right through the weld. I called customer service and they were very helpful in getting a new part ordered FOR SEVENTY FOUR DOLLARS PLUS SHIPPING!!!!! This is a cheap piece of steel with a rod welded on one end. Give me a break.This was a very inexpensive machine - you get what you pay for."
1,waste,This album was not worth the wait or money. It really too bad because his first two albums were great.
1,Poor Quality,"Ordered two 9542 dimmer switches. One switch worked OK, the second did not work. Tough to trouble shoot since it took a while to validate there was no issue with the wiring. Lucklily, I had ordered two and finally could test each switch in both locations and validate one of them worked ok, and the second did not. Not able to exhange via Amazon, only return and then go out and re-order another one."
1,Lousy product - not as advertised.,I got a big giant desktop and not the one in the picture - it failed in a few months and is impossible to fix.
1,item not what I wanted,It is not anyones fault but the coupling I was looking for is not this hard plastic. I could not use this item. Since the shipping and handling was more expensive than the product itself it is not worth sending back.
1,Second-rate chlorella,"I had been using another brand of chlorella for some time with very good results; however, the cost was quite high, so I was looking for an alternative. I read the positive reviews for Swanson chlorella, so I thought I could save myself some money and I ordered some. I was very disappointed by the smell of the product. It almost smells fishy. I took it anyway, and my health condition seemed to deteriorate quickly; I felt fatigued and my joints began to ache. I switched back to the more expensive brand earlier last week. I can tell the difference in quality as soon as I open the package. I will not buy Swanson chlorella again. The cost savings are not worth the reduction in quality."
1,photoshop 7,"Although the book was a good value .68 cents, as far as good instructions it sucks Adobe really needs to step back and make the book more friendly, besides their photoshop CS5 program was not able to download on my Macintosh with OS 10.5.8. That is why I purchased photoshop 7. I suppose Adobe sucks up to the windows operating system. Just make sure you can download the program to your computer before you by it. Also once I downloaded it to my Mac, there was untold problems with the program (Mac compatible) Now the good news. Thrifty Books where I purchased the book took 3 week to ship it to me. I notified them on two different occasions that I had not received my book.They quickly replied when I also notified Amazon of my concern. The book went from Georgia,Texas,Nevada,then to Washington and finally Oregon Arriving August 2nd, One week after my class had ended. My final opinion, Never EVER purchase Photoshop 7 Never EVER purchase it from Thrifty Books."
1,How Can Death Be So Uninteresting?,"Anyone who has read ""The Battle for Christmas"" by Stephen Nissenbaum and is looking for a companion book for Halloween...run. This scattered book talks less about the holiday's history than of its contemporary manfestations (both real and imagined). It meanders in all directions indulging more in Skal's peripheral interests like September 11th and gay-pride parades than in uncovered history. Almost as in search for a suitable number of pages, Skal almost endlessly describes the plots of movies we already know and muses so shamelessly about tourist attractions in Salem that it begins to read like an ad for the Visitors Bureau. This is an overwritten introduction for what could have been. Lots of fluff for those of you who don't want too much information muddying up that slick cover."
1,"""The worst comedy I've ever seen""","Bandits, to simply put it, is a boring unfunny movie with an Ok cast. The ending is incredibly stupid and the whole concept of the film (robbing a bank) is not in every scene (the love triangle between Bruce Willis, Cate Blanchett, and Billy Bob Thornton) I though it was ridiculous, dreadful, and with not one laugh in the whole movie. Do not buy it. Do not even rent it!"
1,Don't Bother!,"We bought this firepit from Plow and Hearth (same exact model, etc.) The very first time we used it, the spark screen caved in and nearly melted from the heat, and it was only a small fire! The cover that comes with it is flimsy, and tore within a few weeks. I think we used the firepit 2 or 3 times (only once with the screen, obviously), and it's ready for the trash. Don't waste your money!"
1,Baffling,"I have never understood why this, of any book purporting to instruct on composition/design, has remained in print for so long when several other books of actual merit have been out of print for so long. Other than the most elementary presentations on composing, the books with any meat in them have until 2007 been available only on the used market.Thankfully, though, there are some top notch books available currently in print. Michael Freeman's ""The Photographer's Eye,"" Harald Mante's ""The Photograph,"" and Torsten A. Hoffmann's book.This book is incomplete, rather misleading, out of date, boring to look at and to read. Take a pass."
1,Don't waste your money,"Used this once and it barely worked then. This was a waste of money, I would've gotten the same result if I threw my money in the garbage."
1,Worst movie I have ever seen!,"Wow, I've seen some real stinkers in my time but this has to be by far the biggest steaming pile of excrement of them all! To those who haven't seen this yet, I recommend you don't waste 92 minutes of your lives on this like I did. I could go into further detail about why this movie is so terrible but I've got better things to do, just check out the other 1 star reviews on here."
1,Hersheyesque,"I've been snookered! The price looked good, the reviews looked good, but the taste? Not so good.Kind of flat. No character. Bad aftertaste.I was hoping for a less expensive alternative to Droste or Valor, but this ain't it."
1,Great TV when it works,"I got my TV in Feb. 2002. My screen went black in April 2002 with a blinking red light on the front, I had the warranty and they replaced the power supply and cord, or so the tech told me and they had the TV for 2 weeks. Works fine again. Jan. 2003, picture is extremely grainy, the tech comes out and takes my tv and replaces one of the boards on the tv works fine again, tv gone for 2 weeks again. October 2006 warranty if up, and I have a convergence problem, the touch focus does not work, and I can't manually move the red convergence, $450 for repairs, tv gone 3 weeks. Jan, 2007, screen goes black, blinking red light. Time for a new tv. I think I'll get an old reliable CRT TV. The Toshiba had a great picture when it worked, but not worth all of the problems. My advise would be b4 you buy, pick which one you want and search through forums to see what problems others may be having."
1,"Cheap, but still not worth it","This is supposed to be a shooter/role-playing game, I guess. Whenever you save, you are transported to a special place. Then you have to make your way back to where you were and all the bad guys have respawned. Your character is underpowered at first and I was getting tired of covering the same ground over and over... This game won't run in Vista. I had to disable my firewall to install it on my XP machine. The game was way too buggy. Sometimes the video would just freak out and I would have to reload from the last save. When the game crashed completely, I decided this game was not worth it."
1,The Official ebay Bible by Jim Griffith,"The word ""bible"" denotes an ""authoritative"" guide....this book, unfortunately, is anything but. Rather, it is a highly opinionated rant about how things should be done on Ebay, according to Jim Griffith. It is sad when an ebay employee who doesn't understand the buying, selling, and feedback problems of the ordinary ebayer writes an ""Official"" guide. This should have been called an ""Unofficial Opinion"". The small disclaimer stating that it is only opinion does nothing to sway the perception that this IS the authoritative guide to ebay. Instead of this drivel, ebay should have taken the time to ask REAL buyers and sellers for input. As it is, they simply let Griff rant, then stamped it with their seal of approval. Anything to make a buck, I guess. This book is a major disappointment."
1,Love it or hate it??,"I know that some people really enjoyed the book, but I was not a fan. I can honestly say that I never hated a book until I read this one. It was incredibly slow, had a lot of GRAPHIC and equally DISTURBING content, and there was no resolution. I agree with an earlier review that I felt absolutely no connection to the characters, and didn't care what happened to them. I didn't know if I was supposed to feel sorry for Elphaba, or if he meant for me to hate her, but at the end, I just hated everyone in the book. No endearing qualities for anyone in Oz, apparently."
1,"Beach balls - yes, balloons - no.","This Quick Pump WAS listed as usable for inflatables. I assumed inflatables included balloons.....I assumed wrong. It does not fill the long animal-making type balloons(which is why I bought it); but with quite a bit of effort will fill round balloons. Considering how noisy it is, you'd think it would blast air....not so much. :("
1,"Not funny, sorry piece of ""literature""","Please do not waste your time on this book. It is not funny at all, author uses techniques of ""shock value"" in this book which instead of being funny turns out to be totally disgusting and felt really sorry for each of crewed up character in the book. I could not finish the book; I felt dirty and wanted to take shower after reading half of it. I am not overly sensitive person, but this book over the top. Because there is not a drop of intelligence, author uses ""shock value"" to draw the attention to the book. There is no substance at all. This book is about degradation of characters and not sure how anyone can find it funny."
1,Liberal-schmiberal,"This brand of crazy is as short sighted as the rest of politics today. A more correct title would be ""How To Ensure Americans Will Continue to Chase False Gods and Vote for a Government That Is Only Successfull at NOT Getting Anything Done"". If you want to have lip-service paid to your ideals, read this book. If you really want to live in a better world, start reading Ayn Rand and Milton Friedman."
1,misleading ad,sure it a -3an aeroquip line but it sure isnt the 15 ft like the title states....now that i look over the description it does say that its 10ft...very misleading ad
1,"Computed Tomography, physical principles, clinical applications and quality control","This book has a wealth of information on CT. It is intended for the serious, hard core CT tech or Doctor who would like to know the intricate in's and outs' of CT. There are many pages of equations used to derive the intricacies of the CT process. What this book is NOT is a good review text for the CT registry. The information is there, but it is extremely hard to find because the Index is limited in scope. For example, looking for ""Pixel"" in the index turns up nothing. ""Voxel"" likewise turns up nothing. I realize these are very basic terms, and any tech looking to take the registry should know these by heart, but it is indicative of the lack in the index. Other terms that one would like to brush up on are also not there. If I were to do it over again, I would not buy this book to review for the CT Registry. otto"
1,Unsatisfied,This product didn't function at all like it was advertised. My wife was very disappointed.
1,simply pathetic,"this review is about the english version, though relevant to the spanish as well. we finally remembered to donate it to the salvation army so we would no longer have to read it to our child. pure sap. c'mon, the elderly mother drives to her grown son's house, scales a ladder to his room and rocks him back and forth, back and forth...touching? creepy! read it at the library before spending the cash!"
1,sad and disheartened,I was so excited to get this and when I did one of the arms was broken. It was not packed well! This is such a cute little ornament and I am disappointed with the way it showed up. My daughter was so sad too.
1,Terrible textbook,Please don't use this book in the classroom. It is very disorganized and confusing to follow. It is the worst textbook I have ever had for a counseling class.
1,Missing the groove is more like it.,"I don't get the title of this album. Ain't no groove here. Just a lot of thrown together, lazily organized songs on which Dylan sounds apathetic and bored. What's the Deal? I have a lot of Dylan albums and it can be a crapshoot as to the quality you're going to get, but this one definitely is one of his lesser albums in quality and artistic merit."
1,Not recommended - redundant information; gaping holes,Very disappointed in the material provided. Information was repeated on major points up to 5 times throughout the text as if it was being covered for the first time. The editor missed some gaping holes in the content. Back cover summary was inconsistent with content. Provided a fair summary of ASAP concepts but severely lacking in explanation and detail.
1,just my luck,"I do not blame the seller nor the maker of this ring, but just my luck im allergic to Titanium. Although allergies to titanium, if its not 100% pure there is a chance of reaction. And of course even if it is 100% pure it is possible for a reaction. Be aware of what metals are in or around your body to eliminate any possible allergic reaction."
1,Sleazy and Petty,"This installation of the Gossip Girl series is just as shallow and superficial as all its predecessors are. The entire plot revolves around getting high, having sex, smoking, and guzzling down alcohol. The whole series is pure trash from beginning to end."
1,Worst controller ever,"ok where to start....well first of all the ink wore off every button within a week, so if you don't know which button is x [] O ^ then you are screwed. controller only syncs to the ps3 1 out of about 4 times so u gotta restart the ps3 and controller multiple times. the analog sticks are more slippery than ice so your thumbs will be constantly falling off them. the start and select button are wedged as close to the sticks as possible so its almost impossible to push them in. this controller does not have a batter pack and uses two AAA batteries that will last about 4 hours if you get the best batteries in the world. many times you will be playing and the screen will start moving upward by itself, its time to restart the controller.I can't think of the other multiple problems with this controller but I think you get the picture.this controller is a piece of garbage and should not be purchased by ANYONE. Unless it drops to 4.99. even then i am not so sure0 stars."
1,Watered down game theory,"The idea is very interesting, but the book is a result of reducing theory into a few sentences, and then repeating it over and over again. Good for airplane reading between business trips, though."
1,VHS The Glass Key,I do not own a VCR anymore. Can't imagine why this movie isn't on a DVD. The VHS tapes have gone the way of the dinosaur. They are a dime a dozen at auctions.
1,Junk.,Junk. Back brakes were defective out of the box. So i attempted to fix it and the Back brake cable broke with my finger barely holding it. after retighting the cable only one side of the brake works. The kick stand can't even hold up the bike properly Overall The picture gives the bike more justice to its overall look in person.
1,Broke the first time I used it.,"Broke the first time I used it. Little plastic bit broke off the spool, so it wouldn't retract fully any more. Cheap build quality. Would not recommend."
1,What happen Amazon??,"First the box set was very bad the movie Jewel of the nile wasnt play and play very slow. After i returned amazon gift me a new box set(new??) first was open very bad, and the booklets inside was missing from romacing. Well its the first that happen, with amazon. Hope not a second."
1,Desiring God,"I recently received the book ""Desiring God"" by John Piper from WaterBrook Multnomah for review.I had heard good things about John Piper and this was the first of his writings that I had received. Despite being excited about reading the book, I found myself frustrated.This book was very difficult to get into. I felt that it was very wordy. Piper could have said many things in a fraction of the words. I felt like I had to read three to four pages in order to understand an idea that shouldn't have exceeded a paragraph.This book had a lot of good things in it, it just takes a long time to get the meat out of it. I would not recommend this book to someone who is looking for a quick and easy read. This would be a good book for a church or ministry leader who doesn't mind a lot of ""fluff"" to go along with the ideas presented."
1,doesn't hang together,"This short book is a memoir of about 2 years in the author's life, told in short vignettes. The style of writing and the translation are easy to read, but the story is hard to follow. The chapters are short and choppy and intervening events tend to be left out. For example, the first several chapters are all about how the author and her lover are so poor they can't afford food or wood to heat their apartment with. A few chapters later, however, they seem to have enough money to live without scrimping. It is quite unclear how this change in fortune came about. Similarly, in the latter chapters, a book is mentioned which is referred to as ""our book."" The book seems to be in the final stages of publication, but the reader has no idea what the book is about (although the contents seem to be subversive since they feel as though the Japanese police might show up to arrest them at any moment). All in all then, this is a sort of confusing read."
1,Flaming Lips Fall A Long Way From Their Golden Age,"It's sad to say, but although the Flaming Lips last 2 regular length albums are very Dreamy, Echoey, and Well-produced, they fall far short of the southern-noise rock gold that encompassed albums like Clouds Taste Metalic, Hit To Death In The Future Head, Transmissions From The Satelite Heart, and In A Priest Driven Ambulance. Through sharpening up their studio finesse, it seems they may have lost touch with that simple, grungy, happy/sad sound that so many had come to love. This album isn't a BAD album per se,it soars in production, but falls flat on its face in plain old fun."
1,Item different from what is shown,"This item lacks the ""rubber finger grips for comfortable use"" that is in the product description, and is also physically different from the picture shown here. See my uploaded pic for what item actually looks like."
1,Cannot recommend,"As a former Alaskan, I didn't want to have to do this. But after repeatedly attempting Allman's recipes and having to throw out 8-10 cups of flour and miscellaneous ingredients nearly every time--and then comparing to Ed Wood's recipes which work flawlessly, and Lisa Rayner's very excellent Wild Bread: Hand-baked sourdough artisan breads in your own kitchen, I can't help but notice that their recipes work, where Allman's fail.I'm not a novice baker. The only thing that worked reliably was the pancakes recipe, but that can be found other places as well.If you are looking for reliable recipes and concise information about starting a sourdough and maintaining it, I recommend any of Ed Wood's books, even his very old ones. Lisa Rayner has written a fabulous tome in Wild Bread. But pass on this book.While some of the historical vignettes were interesting--not enough so to warrant the cost of the book. Check it out at your library if you must."
1,False advertising,"Far from the promised ""convenient, accessible guide"" to Kant for ""new readers and nonspecialists,"" this is merely a loose collection of papers by Anglo-American Kant scholars. While a few of the papers might interest those in that circumscribed group, this book is both useless to the unintiated and often susbstandard to those who know Kant well."
1,"Oh, Please!","This movie blows. I could go on and on about what I didn't like about this movie, but it is easier to explain what I did like-which is nothing."
1,Bad design !,"The 2nd release mechanism is BENEATH the strap, so when you have a load strapped down its almost impossible to disengage 2nd trigger !!!! This is why i think the price is so low ! They GET YOU on the eye bolts though !!! 2 for well over $20.00... WHAT A RIP OFF !!!"
1,Seriously?,"I'm completely in favor of using the internet, reading articles online, digital music and other various activities which signal a trend to a leave the concrete world for a paperless one; however, I must say that reading ONLY on a screen should never replace the experience of reading a book. Part of what makes the activity of ""reading a book"" unique is the whole experience. If you don't believe me, read the first Chapter of Italo Calvino's ""If on winter's night a traveler"".The other MAJOR downfall with Kindle is that it severely limits the amount of books one can access. It is difficult to find anything which is not considered extremely mainstream and probably isn't on at least ONE list of some sort (bestseller, Oprah, etc). Can you imagine walking into a bookstore and ONLY having the tables with the books currently being pushed available for reading? What about books with illustrations or children's books, which regularly have pictures in color?You can't replace books."
1,Disappointing,"Yes, I realize the book was advertised as a comprehensive book on herbal healing of Lyme Disease. And Yes, the spirochette descriptions were great.However, I don't feel that there was enough space given to traditional treatments and how they work. Also, not much is written about late stage lyme.I really don't care to know where an herb came from or how it is harvested, I just want to know what works and how it works."
1,Trash!,"Drip, drip, drip. This drain pan will leak all over your garage floor. Totally worthless. Please do not waste your money."
1,--Not worth the time--,"I really enjoyed WHEN THE WIND BLOWS, and was delighted to find that the author had written a sequel; however, this story was a major disappointment and didn't have the thrilling excitement of the first book.THE LAKE HOUSE really left me with a sick kind of feeling and the characters lacked the charisma from the previous book. The story itself was very simplistic and distasteful in many places, but I hung in to the end thinking that maybe something would get better, but it really didn't improve.You won't miss much by skipping this book."
1,"Great, but incomplete","The episodes are great, and I have loved every bit of this set... until the final disc. Disc 14, the last 3 episodes recorded, was disc 13. I had 2 disc 13s. Much to my dismay, I cannot finish the series despite the rather high cost for the set."
1,Too Pricey,"I bought the product and the colours are beautiful and it arrived speedily, but boy are the packets small! Ok so the weight checks out. I just somehow imagined it to be a bit bigger. It's a bit pricey and I would think twice before purchasing it again."
1,Not exactly accurate.,"An innocent man is paying for someone else's crime, thanks to our unjust judicial system. No matter what was 'found' in the trial, you're blaming the wrong person. But I guess God has a weird way of punishing everyone, right."
1,Poor quality hinge makes for poor quality kettle.,"I received this kettle for Christmas 2004 and it broke within days of being used. The hinge that allows the sliding button on the handle that closes and opens the whistling lid on the spout is made of very thin plastic. Mine seemed to get brittle after just a week's worth of uses (5-10 heat-ups) and it broke. There were small bits of black plastic as evidence and the lid now opens with the button, but must be closed manually. I did email Copco and they did offer to repair/replace it if I had the upc from the box or the receipt, but I had neither since it was a gift. I feel it was my fault that I couldn't return it and I appreciate the offer."
1,You must be joking,"Disappointing to say, but it's rather hard to get past the immature writing. The author breaks about every rule of good writing and composition for excessive and off-track babbling about things that no one who bought the book would want. Yes, it's supposed to make it more fun/entertaining, but I felt it diffused rather than enhanced the book. I wouldn't recommend this book even though it contains one redeeming value: Each topic covers a helpful ""Why do I need to know this"" section that at least gives purpose to the read and is helpful for young students."
1,Serviceable but not the best,"This is a merely serviceable version of the Tao Te Ching - not exceptionally accurate, but what's worse is, in this extremely prolific market, it doesn't offer anything other than a bare-bone translation. No commentary, no explanatory notes or introduction. In such a highly competitive field, this is simply not good enough to fork cash out for a purchase."
1,"Not challenging enough, even 9 months pregnant and awkward!","Don't get me wrong, I like Denise Austin. At least, I want to like her. She is so positive and upbeat. However, I found this workout to be WAY too easy. The cardio portion barely got my heart rate elevated. I found the workout very dull and repetitive. I did the workout probably three times before I finally decided that a good brisk walk would get me into better shape. Sorry, Denise. We can still be friends."
1,An interesting mistake,"I got this book because amazon had linked it with Neal Stephenson's The Confusion. The two books are nothing a like but subject matter of both was an interest to me and most reviewers seemed to liked it so I go it too. Overall, the book just never lived up to its potential. I would have liked to have given 2.5 stars because it certainly does grab you in the beginning, but you can't here. Nonethess I rounded down because the story never turns into anything interesting. I felt I was reading a high school student trying to write like Eco. The ending is laughable. However, I would suggest that an aspiring writer should read this and something like Arturo Pérez-Reverte's The Club Dumas; Club being an example of a well made literary mystery."
1,Synthetic oil,I can not truthfully give this more than one star. What I thought was the real thing turned out to be synthetic. I will not be buying anything from this vender again.charly
1,Orb fizzle out.,"There's really not much to cheer about with this album. Time seems to have left Orb behind. Gone is the long, spacey ambient flotation and we are left with music that is more dub with female vocals more than anything else. I don't like the feel of this record though there seems to be plenty of other reviewers who disagree. Can anybody really say they like the cover?"
1,Better buy a remote too...,"shaky shaky shaky. if you buy this tripod, you better have a remote or you photos are going to be a blurry mess. The neck has no stability! Also i wouldn't wrap the legs around anything too high off the ground. Not the most reliable grippers and joints."
1,"Not bad, but cuts off last 1 to 2 seconds per file.","Not a bad little player with many useful features. Memory is not expandable, but that is fine for general use. The most annoying feature though is that the last 1 to 2 seconds of each mp3 file is cut off. While listening to music, you hardly notice this, but with audio books (my main reason for purchase) it is horrible. Every 5 minutes or so you miss 3 or 4 words. So if you are listening to books, you would be better off spending your money on a player that plays the entire mp3 file.Also, while it plays back the files inside of folders in alphabetical order, it does NOT play back the folders themselves in alphabetical order. So for audio books this can be a nightmare. For example, if you labeled your folders ""Disk 01"", ""Disk 02"", etc. it will instead play them back in the order the folders were created on the mp3 player."
1,Quit working within 10 months,"I purchased a refurbished unit. After approximately 10 months, the maker no longer freezes the ingredients. The most likely cause is a leak in the refrigerant line. My suspicion is that KitchenAid, upon return for refurbishment, didn't fix the leak but rather simply recharged the R134A. They offer only a six month warranty on refurbished units and the recharge would in all likelihood last beyond that (as it did). Again, this is my suspicion. I've heard others having many problems with KitchenAid's Pro Line toasters. I cannot recommend KitchenAid Pro Line series of products. They've discontinued various products in this series, possibly due to quality control issues."
1,Painful,"I read the entire book in an attempt to justify having paid full price for it. It was a waste of time.The basic idea of the story (a satirical, pun-filled fairy tale) showed promise. However the characters were extremely shallow and unlikeable; particularly the drab, dopey, sponge-like heroine, Anna."
1,Not an extra large size,I have a 90 lb dog. I would like to send you a video of her trying to fit inside this crate so you can use for advertisement lol THIS NOT X-LARGE! nice crate tho. Good for puppies or ankle bitters
1,Limited,"Although the font in this book is very large, as for 2nd or 3rd graders, the vocabulary in the book is more applicable to high school. As an adult, I found it exceptionally dry. Illustrations are just maps and photos. Grades 11-12"
1,On The Fence,"Zoe finds her life changed with her 25th birthday. Who doesn't like chocolate? Who can expect her boyfriend to accept her superhero qualities. Not the best written book, but enjoyable for a freebie."
1,Do your homework first...,"I was VERY disappointed in this book for several reasons:1). The author mentions the use of mineral oil and petrolatum as a moisturizer (for those of you that don't know these are byproducts of gasoline and are AWFUL for your skin, the cosmetic/beauty industry only use it because it is dirt cheap and never goes bad).2). It is not practical to put your time and effort into making something for one application (will we really see results after just one use?). I suppose you can multiply the recipes but most of the recipes need to be used ASAP or they spoil. Needless to say I have not found a happy medium!3). I have coarse curly hair- I tried one of the ""hair packs"" and needless to say it was a MESS! It took several shampoos to get all of the stuff out of my hair.In conclusion, I would reccommend you research what products are actually good for you and not just convienient for the makers!"
1,"I thought it was great, until it started to fall apart","This model had it all - all the features you could want. I posted a glowing review back in 2007 when I bought it. Well, I just sold its dead carcass on eBay for $55 (July, 2011). First the subwoofer output died, then the right channel started dying randomly, then the sound would cut out entirely, and finally it would just turn itself off randomly. It had nothing to do with volume or temperature as far as I could tell. The problems got much worse shortly after the warranty expired until it would sometimes turn on and sometimes not. It seems like they tried to pack too many goodies in for the price."
1,Try Try Again Please Mike,"I've always been a fan of Mike Epps. I love the movies, but I watched most of this DVD on YouTube. There's one sketch in particular were he and a black female are imitating Michele & Barack Obama in the White House that I found totally offensive to our first African American President & First Lady. The skit was full of stereotypes and for Mike to go there, I was disappointed. It's just not funny at all. Save your money. Watch it on YouTube."
1,Looks cool...but not a good buy,"I was excited to buy this remote after reading some good reviews in a magazine. However, the batteries lasted less than a week; slight vibrations turned it on. Also, the screen was difficult to see during the daytime, even at the brightest setting. After less than a week, I'm packing it up to return."
1,MY POOR EYES!,"I walked into my local video store to browse, and they just happened to be playing the dubbed ""R"" movie. After watching it for about 10 minutes, I had to leave the store in disgust. The dubbed version of Sailor Moon was AWFUL! Dic removed most of the superb Japanese music, leaving awkward dead air in some spots. The rewritten dialogue was even worse. They just added in stupid one-liners that would appeal more to 5-year-olds. When Rini said ""Do your thing, Moon Mama!"" that was about when I left the store, grimacing. If you can get the original Japanese uncut version, you MUST see it! The music is beautiful and, most importantly, it's UNCUT! It's 100 times better that anything Dic could ever dub."
1,DOESN'T WORK,We tried testing 4 different people several times with this blood pressure monitor and everyone the reading wasn't accurate. All the readings were so low that you would be dead if they were accurate. Do not buy this item.
1,these watches are rubbish..,"service is rubbish, the watch is rubbish, nothing but problems and all the agent repairers do is send it back with a grotty instruction sheet from Tissot saying basically 'don't bother putting it in water and don't press the pushers or it will can out...' derrrrr this is just the most usless watch i have ever bought and I have one of all the best! serial number of mine: Z252/352 QKQ-OR-124498... oh well back to the repairs again as it's gone wrong for the forth time in 12 months... altimeter this time :( useless."
1,Sandcastles/Born to be Sold DVD,Although I gave this item a good feedback - I had not watched the DVD before I did so. It looked like any other dvd I have seen but the quality is like a bootleg. The quality of the film on a scale of 1 to 10 (10 being best) is a one. Very disappointed in the quality. Very dark and blurred. For the money I paid - I am not happy with the purchase.
1,Blah...,"I read this book about a year ago, and I still can't figure out the plot. My advice to you is to save your precious time and money. Even Judy Blume can write a better book."
1,The Global brain awakens,"Total nonsens, probably written by somebody who had a little bit to much L.S.D. in the 60's."
1,False Advertising,"The rest of this album might be legit, I cannot say as I only bought one song. Early One - Jig Jig Jig. I don't know who is preforming this but its not Early One. Don't waste your money here. Back to youtube every time I want to hear the real song..."
1,I don't really care what you did last summer,"I am not into these genre of teen horror flicks that use stupid dialogue and overdone plot sequences.These movies aren't scary at all. Save your money and don't watch this movie. If you want to see a scary movie, go rent one of the Exorcist movies. Sorry, I wish this review could be more helpful, but I just couldn't resist bashing this movie."
1,history,"We were so happy to find a historical series about England. We were enjoying the costumes, acting, and dialogue, then all of a sudden we were quite shocked to find out it was laced with pornography. It's totally unnecessary to the storyline, so it must be something the producer/director gets off on. Ruined it for us and we wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
1,Disappointing,"Mr. Clark seems like a high energy, innovative soul who genuinely cares for his students. The workbook, however, is disappointing. It is mostly a compilation of busy work exercises. One particular multiple-choice activity directs students to match a person with something he or she may have dropped. I feel certain Mr. Clark's own role-playing activities (mentioned in his book The Essential 55) hold far more meaning and value for students. Mr. Clark might better serve parents and teachers by providing suggestions, scenarios, and guidelines for managing those more memorable experiences."
1,a big disappointment,"This book started out with such a bang that I was sorely disappointed when it degenerated into such a clunky writing style shortly thereafter. Mr. Holton is in bad need of an editor; there's a good story here, but its clumsy execution keeps getting in the way. Not only that, but the title is a ripoff of a sci-fi classic, The Left Hand of God."
1,It did not accurately describe basic principles of chemistry,"It was very difficult to understand. It was poorly written and not thought out very well. Students who use this book have a very difficult time with it. I would not recommend it to be used as a teaching tool, but maybe as a reference guide to those who have already had basic chemistry and have already acquired a knowledge of basic chemistry."
1,1st album was better,THIS ALBUM DOESN'T EVEN COMPARE TO THE 1ST ALBUM. IT DOESN'T HAVE TOO MUCH FUNK. NOW IT'S MORE SPANISH- WHY? IT WOULD'VE BEEN COOL TO HAVE MORE RAPPING BUT OH WELL. DON'T BUY THIS UNLESS YOU REALLY HAVE TO.
1,Great concept but poor quality and durabilty,"Really loved them when I first got them, convienent to pack, easy to slip on, warm and waterproof.But they didn't even last through one winter. Wore them around one to three times a week for only 20 to 60 minutes at a time.By spring the strap had broken and the rubber had split leaving them very non-waterproof.If I would have needed for a situation to actually protect my feet from frostbite or immersion foot I would have been SOL.If these were $20 Totes overshoes it might be acceptable to sell a disposable item, but these are priced for what you can get a decent quality winter boot for. There's no reason they couldn't have used slightly better materials and made a decent product."
1,Depressing,"What happend to happily ever after? A depressing story. It ends bad, and through out the book sirena is discontent because she doesnt know what the man (A forgot his name) is doing. ANd he spends most of his time on land... It is an okay book I supose but not worth your money or your time. If you want to read it go to the library."
1,Not as Good as I thought it Would Be,"In short, I was disappointed. I was looking for a great adventure, and found myself getting bogged down by the author's penchant for skipping around in different times. For example, you're reading about two pirates and have been reading about them for some time, when suddenly he states, ""in fact, they had met some time before..."" and then goes to another chapter about what occurred ten years before. He does this several times and I found it disconcerting, and in some cases, boring. This author also has a way of stating an unpleasantry in a blunt and vulgar manner, that looks like he's attempting to shock you. I didn't appreciate that.Read Batavia's Graveyard, The Ice Master, or any other ""sea adventure,"" before choosing this one."
1,Not the right one,I bought this thinking it was something else. This did not work as well as the other and caused me some problems. I would not buy this again.
1,NOT TEAR FREE,"Just make sure you know this is not a tear-free formula. I only found out when my son started screaming while I was washing his hair. On the flip-side, I have been using it for my own hair and love it. So, buy it for yourself but not for the baby."
1,Very disappointing,"I expected this to contain live performances of this great artist. This is a documentary which interview people who have passed close to the artist. For example, a woman who works at Tower Records where he signed autographs once was interviewed for over 10 minutes. On top of that, none of his music was ever played. Even the interview with the man himself was dubbed over by a narrator. If you are a real Ricky fan, I would avoid this."
1,Terrible quality,"The quality of both the audio and (especially) the video ruins any enjoyment this DVD can hope to convey. I couldn't get past it, and I refuse to watch a video from a band who claims to call themselves ""artists"". If they are actually ""artists"" then I believe they should do a better job with the DVD format - a fantastic palette."
1,Don't do it,"I wish I'd have seen the last guy's review, I wouldn't have bought this. It's just a bunch of sound effects and computer noises. No music, not easy to listen to, in fact it's really kind of irritating. Maybe his other stuff is better, but don't get this one. The extra star is just in case he was in a slump during this album. Everyone else seems to like it."
1,"If you want comedy, put this one back on the shelf...","I have been reading what other people have thought of EAST IS EAST, and just want to know: WHAT WAS SO FUNNY? I watch alot of british comedies, and this was not that funny at all. I was very disappointed with this film. It was more dramatic and tragic than comedic. It's about a family in which the Pakistan father of a large group of children, whose mother is English. The father is trying to keep with tradition of Pakistan and arrange his sons' marriages. There was very little humor in my opinion, I laughed maybe four times in the entirity of the film. The acting was pretty good, but it was so sad how the father treated his family especially his wife. It was disturbing to me how it ended. I don't recommend this movie at all, it was fair."
1,"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, DVD, Jeff East version","It's a musical! I wouldn't have bought it if I'd known that, and it wasn't notes in the advertising blurb. Had I read the reviews I would have twigged, but I didn't. All those unrealistically cleanclothed happy black faces bobbing up from their cotton picking singing happily was a turn-off right fromthe start. (U|I didn't go any further.) Of course, if you like musicals................."
1,"Content ok, WAY too short for price","We have a VAST Disney dvd library, all the theatricals and direct-to-dvd sequels and more. Just want to let you know where I'm coming from when I say that this release feels like a ripoff. The content is about what one might expect, with Mater describing ridiculous tales of his experience. Some are pretty well done. But it is short, didn't notice that before buying it. If you are a parent who wants your money's worth, this release will not provide that satisfaction. The show (a collection of shorts) will be finished before your kids finish their snacks. At $15 and up... pass on it. If you can score it for $10 or less, maybe when amazon has one of their flash sales, or maybe even on a future black friday, then that might be worth it."
1,"""Bristle"" does not mean ""natural bristle""","I wish I had read the reviews before I bought these. These are polyester brushes of the poorest quality. I know others said that their bristle didn't shed, but mine came out by the handfuls. I will donate them to the little kids to use."
1,Will not work with 64 bit computer,"I bought this hoping to synch my old Palm Pilots m515 and V with my new HP G-70 64-bit laptop. There is no driver to make the 64-bit platform work with the Palm Pilots.Cables Unlimited USB1510 USB Acc, USB To Irda Adapter"
1,Good movie gets poor release,"I picked up this DVD because I had never seen Ali Baba and the Seven Saracens. I have several copies of the Fury of Achilles (which is an excellent Sword and Sandal film) and figured I wouldn't mind having another at the bargain price to get Ali Baba.When I popped the disc in to my player I was very upset by what I saw. This release by Alpha video is absolutely awful. The picture is terrible. The transfer of Achilles is soft and very snowy(and appears to be missing 3 or 4 minutes). Its the worst version of the film I own. The transfer of Ali Baba is severely scratched and at times you actually can see cracks in the source print. Its watchable,but with other versions of both titles out at bargain prices, why would anyone want to release such poor looking transfers?Take my advice do take a look at these two good sword and sandal films, just do it in different editions."
1,Sad boys,"My two sons chose to combine their allowances to buy this as a shared toy--a nice gesture, I thought. Unfortunately, this was a total washout. The range seems to be about 15 feet (after that static overwhelms intelligibility), and limited to line-of-sight--even going slightly around a corner makes the message cut out. A complete waste; couldn't be more of a rip-off. I thought the Transformer folks would care at least a little about protecting the integrity of their brand, but I guess not."
1,Wrongly Described,"I ordered this since I needed CLEAR plastic sheeting, which is what this supposedly is. One major problem - it is totally opaque and therefore useless for my purpose. I contacted the supplier/vender and after a great many exchanges over many days they conceded that it was not described properly. They were initially trying to determine if I simply got the wrong product. I was required to send them photos of the package, the shipping label, etc. It was a tremendous hassle. The finally agreed to refund my money, to occur after I shipped the item back. That was weeks ago and while they claim that they refunded the money to Amazon and I would get my refund from Amazon, Amazon has no record of the refund and is investigating."
1,Where's the plot????!!!!,"This short volume isn't worthy enough to be called a tale, book, or even a novel...it was so trite and simple. That this book came to be when two writers were writing joke letters back and forth greatly emphasises this books low reading and that it's an ideal book for simple minds. Where was the plot? Not in this book, that's for sure..."
1,Worst Comedian of All Time,"Things I find funny:Conan O BrienArrested DevelopmentThe HangoverSeinfeldAs for this guy, I wasn't just not amused, I found this guy painfully unfunny and obnoxious. I don't think comedy could get any worse than this."
1,Worked Once,I tried more than 20 times to get the lock to secure but only got it to work once. When I needed it to work I could not get it to lock. I literally was so mad at it I threw it into the trash. It wasn't worth the return shipping costs.
1,Not as pictured!,"It shows the product can hold a $20 bill. WRONG! The box is smaller/shorter than any bill. If you decide to use it, you have to fold the money up twice and it's almost too thick to fit. I'm not sure it's even going to come out when my dad solves the puzzle. I wish the review on Dec 22 was posted earlier because I would have not purchased and wasted my time on this product!Bilz Box"
1,Are you serious?,"I commute alot so getting a rain cover was great. So when I got it and tried to put it on, I was very disappointed. The picture is very misleading. It looks to be a perfect fit, but hardly the story. The cover might be able to fit over a purse or book bag, but not your typical trunk bag. Would not recommend this to anyone, complete waist of money and time."
1,Disappointed,"I purchased a couple of these directly from Peach Tree and when they arrived I found that both of them weren't even close to being flat, both were bowed up in the middle. I called Peach Tree and was instructed to bend them to straighten them out. That worked somewhat but they still aren't as flat as they're supposed to be. I would not buy this product again."
1,European!,THis version is the European version and does not fit with a britax marathon 70. Read everything before purchasing!! I couldn't find anywhere in the description that said this and didn't find out until we assembled it and realized the wheels did not work with our car seat. I like the concept but will have to find the right wheels! Maybe call amazOn to confirm before purchasing? They have good customer service.
1,An average product,"It's an average product. The software packages bundled with the burner are ok. I had to buy a better burning software. It's a usb product but doesn't work on macintosh. Though HP claims the burner dooesn't support Mac, it's still bit disappointing to know that it doesn't really work on mac. I'm saying this, because when ZipCD first came out, Iomega didn't have the driver and software for mac and yet it still worked on the platform. Even MS usb mouses without a driver works on mac. What really amazes me about HP is that customer representative never replies your email enquiries. BTW, HP delivers rebate checks really fast, and that's the only thing I like about HP."
1,Dated Wartime Artifact,"This film won on Oscar for best screenplay in 1945. This is probably more of a reflection of the attitudes expressed in the script than any artistry contained within. I can see where the film would strike a chord with wartime audiences with it's portrait of Nazi agents operating freely within our borders. Today, however, the film is just incredibly dated in it's depiction of an omnipotent FBI and cartoonish Nazis. I would rate this film higher but it moves at such a snails pace that it borders on the sleep-inducing. William Eythe as Dietrich, the American double-agent, has to be one of the most wooden actors ever to star in a major motion picture. He was definitely competing with the coat rack in the magnetism department. If you must see this film see it as a wartime propaganda relic. And remember, you can purchase your war bonds at the theatre."
1,A real disappointment!,"I read a review that gave this toy some negative feedback so I decided to test it out before my little girl's birthday. Just as another reviewer said, the drawer on the cash register doesn't stay closed because the spring is broken. In addition, the scanner feature doesn't work at all. It's such a cute toy, but it is VERY poorly made. I would not recommend it."
1,Modern day money pit.,"This is the perfect television for the person who has too much money and a second television. Having had mine for almost 4 years now, I have replaced the lamp three times and am now having to replace the ""ballast"". If you pay full retail, that would be an additional $1400.00 in parts and service. Fortunately, some people are selling the lamps (without the housings) and ballast kits at way below repair shop prices. Even at that, this was a television which should have had a formal recall from Panasonic a long time ago. I guess sometimes technology doesn't make life easier (at least not based on my blood pressure). Consider another television...any other television."
1,As Chris Rock said...,"""Ricky Martin needs a another hit, like a crackhead needs a hit"". And Chris Rock wasn't lying. He knew what more and more people are beginning to realize is Ricky Martin is a joke. Songs like the patheic ""Private Emotion"", the lame ""She's All I Ever Had"", and the silly ""Shake Your Bon Bon"" are enough to make him my generation's Tom Jones. These songs do NOT stand the test of time and it makes you wonder what was happening in the world during 1999 to make this guy a success. The only good song is ""Livin' La Vida Loca"" and after a while, its gets tiring. Trust me when I say, this album is NOT worth your time."
1,Look Elsewhere!!,"I order two sets of these stands for my front and rear bookshelf speakers in my home theater. I read the reviews here and all sounded good. I even contacted the speaker manufacturer, HSU Research, who told me these were the very stands they use in their demo room. The price was right so I ordered up. When they arrived I removed them from the box and began to assemble them. By the time I got the fourth screw in I called it quits. All the screw holes were pre-drilled and I went very slowly as not to over tighten. EVERY joint split from the assembly screws. Not just one which could be a fluke. Every piece split. These stands are something my wife and I would call ""first apartment"" quality. If your broke and don't care, they'll do. Probably won't last long as they are starting off split. If you want a quality stand, go with something else. We ended up with the VTI DF series metal stands."
1,I don't like it,"Don't even know how to review this album, there's really nothing I like about it. ""Moon & Antarctica"" was my favorite Modest Mouse, this is far and away my least. As others have said: no it doesn't sound like MM, yes it sounds like bad Tom Waits or worse, yes it's overproduced & under-thought-out. MM was one of the very last bands I was still excited about, but had I heard this album before I bought it, I never would have bought it. So if you're actually reading this review trying to decide if you should get the album or not, I would strongly encourage you to at least borrow somebody else's copy 1st. Maybe you'll be into it, and you can ignore this and the other negative reviews, but for those (like me) who are dreadfully disappointed with the disc, I think it would have been nice to have had some warning. If I'd never heard MM before and I put this disc on, I honsestly would have turned it off by the 4th song."
1,Not so good...,"I felt the giver had ver interesting ideas, but they were expressed so slow and boring. It ruined a lot of the book."
1,Poor quality.,"Very poor quality product. My husband has experience with upholstery so it should have been an easy project. The bottom layer was cut wrong and had to be pieced together. The cloth with the grid printed on it was not accurate or square so could not be applied correctly. Of course, now that it has been stapled, glued etc. it can't be returned. Don't waste your money."
1,Dissapointing,I was expecting maybe too much from this DVD.It allowed me to tweak one or two settings....The rest is very basic stuff for which you don't need the DVD.However the host and the overall production value of the DVD might be worth the $$!!!It is so cheesy it is hilarious!!! 80's music video meets spanish soap opera meets home made video
1,horrible,"this is not punk. this is not punk. not punk. i'm sorry, but if you want to take some 80's pop and add guitars and bad voices, go right ahead, but dont call it punk. if you want to wear your wristbands and cut up shirts just like the members of GC, go right ahead, but dont consider yourself punk. punk is a lifestyle, not the way you wear your hair. try listening to something real, like taking back sunday."
1,Not on my recommended list...your choice,"If you haven't read the works of Robert Stanek, you should pick those up before reading this book (and the rest of this series). Many contemporary writers seem to take crib notes from Stanek's works, but rarely give due where they should. Start with The Kingdoms and the Elves of the Reaches books and go on to the Service of Dragons books. You'll note similar large casts of characters, similar structures to the story, and in some cases very similar plotting."
1,Wilton gum paste,"When I mixed up my first batch, it was hard as a rock with the recommended 1/4c of water. Any videos you see out on the web, and it's supposed to be rather messy and a bit on the soupy/dough side. This was like hard dough that had too much flour mixed in. It stuck in big chunks to the mixing paddle, and trying to knead it was all but impossible.Skip this product and just mix up a batch from a website recipe instead - it's not worth the time, money, or aggravation you're going to encounter."
1,Very hard to understand,After spending a few weeks reading this book I really can tell you that you should not buy this book. First of all nothing is in order and he tries to work thinking that you know everything. This book does not cover a lot on programming it is very bored the author doesn't know how to attract the reader.
1,Not great.,"This was a somewhat enjoyable book until about 2/3 of the way through it. It became an excrutiatingly slow read. However, if you want to read up on HIV and it's symptoms/emotions, you might enjoy it."
1,one of the worst,"I can't belive how violent this game is, its so blah blah blah blah blah...Everybody should own this game, including children, its a fun game and funny too. I reccomend this to anyone with fingers. All the features of this game are amazing, i dont see what is so sick about it, its not REALITY, its pretend."
1,Not a history book,"It must be nice to be able to put personal opinions and worldview in a book, present them as absolute fact, and sell it as a history book. Hmmm."
1,They've cut their own throats with this game....,"This program is, in a word, disappointing. I am constantly making comparisons to Sid Meier's Pirates! and coming away saddened that a 15+ year old game is superior in playability and pleasure. Certainly, the graphics are better than in Pirates, but the game is so cumbersome that it seems virtually impossible to ever find the exact correct balance of resources, crew members, and missions to be successful. I guess I'll just keep looking for a good follow up to Pirates!"
1,Some Assembly Required,"I was happy when I received my pasta maker, hoping I could make pasta for my kids. But when I opened it, it was in pieces. The screws came out and the rollers were not working at all when I turned the crank. I had to open it up and piece it back together. Lucky for me there was no instructions to assemble it so I had to tinker with it for an hour. When I got it pieced together and then made some dough, I ran it through the roller and guess what, the pasta did not go straight down the cutter. It just wraps around the roller. I've read some others reviews to add more flour, so I tried it and it still didn't work. I kinda wish I spent an extra 20 bucks for the name brand pasta maker. I probably is worth the price and a lot less trouble. So I recommend a skip this and buy the other guys stuff."
1,An audio blunder,"If you are a fan of ""The lord of the rings"" audio version by the BBC, BE ADVISED THIS IS NOTHING LIKE THAT! This version of The Hobbit sounds like a group of elementarry children put it together.I realize that the hobbits are little,but the way their voices are on this version is similar to the lollipop guild from the wizard of oz. Very irritating. This is truly a version for children."
1,Renewal Notice Arrives - Where are my 7 Missing Issues???,"Purchased multiple subscriptions for friends and family. Imagine my horror when I realize their gifts are arriving sporadically IF AT ALL!!! Only received 3 out of 10 promised issues the entire year for my subscription. Seems to be a pattern with this Company. Yet they have the gall to send me my Renewal Notice. How about the Magazines I've already paid for!!!!!! Loved the Magazine when it did arrive. Nice change from the typical fashion magazines bizarre clothes that most people wouldn't even wear. These are actually real clothes that you can find in the store or find similar styles at a price point within ones budget. Wouldn't recommend subscription as it is not worth the cost given the sporadic delivery/missed issues, but would recommend reading it/flipping through the pages at perhaps your public library."
1,Not true,"They run very small and its almost impossible to get your foot in your true size. If you order these, order a larger size."
1,Paper jams all the time,Constant paper jams. Google around and you'll find others experience the same problem with the Lexmark E323.
1,CRIME-cano burned my flesh!,"this toy delivered 100% of the nightmare described by the other hideous reviews, with one added and unexpected bonus: the slime caused a fabulous burning sensation on my hands. another bonus: lots of laughs triggered by our inability to control our involuntary, reflex-like use of profanity during the assembly phase. they should include blood pressure medication and counseling with this thing. it will push you to the breaking point, and all you will be able to do is laugh maniacally. forget ever taking it apart. you'll never put it together again. the only way to get it de-slimed was to hose it down in the tub (alas, with itchy, burning hands). our plan is to permanently glue the whole thing together and let our son keep it in his room until the fascination wears off."
1,Needs a non-leather option,"Many people object to wearing leather, and I am one of them. I will buy this product when it's full plant or synthetic materials."
1,Not so much,"My cat loves to chase and swat toys around the house. Her curiosity with theses shimmer balls is limited to watching me try to entice her to play with them. Durable, pretty, pricey, and not for my cat."
1,Unexpectedly boring,"I really expected to like this book, but I finally gave up. This is one of the few books that I just could not finish. The wry spark from the earlier books is just not there. I have to wonder if Clive wrote any of this?"
1,not real happy,The batteries that came with the phone were dead. I had to purchase new ones. The base (charger) does not work at all. The phone itself is inworking condition. The seller offered to reimburse me for batteries only.I will keep phone because I do have another charger in my home. But Iam disappointed overall.
1,Max throughput == 5MBit.,"This switch has one *very* serious drawback, which it also shares with the more recent 704: a maximum throughput of 5MBit/s.That means that if you have a faster connection than that (I have 10MBit) the remaining bandwidth is simply wasted. For me, transfer rates immediately dropped from 1.3Mbyte/s to 650KByte/s when I plugged this device in.Like most of D-links gear, ie their laughably slow & buggy wireless routers, this device simply does not live up to its specs.Avoid."
1,Small and not wOrth it,This truck was not worth $8.18 it was so small it look like a hot wheel car it's that small. I didn't bother returning it cause it would be a waste of time. It look nice but I wouldn't buy it again so if u looking for a big truck this is not it
1,Missed The Sky,"Skylarkin' was a disappointing album from Grover Washington, Jr. It features nothing of note except for the slick ""Snake Eyes"". ""Easy Loving You"" might be his worst song. It grates on you with a piercing whistle sound throughout."
1,Blck & Decker dustbuster,"Finally, I thought I had a good dustbuster. It had a long lasting charge and had good suction. But, just like previous ones, it is dead after just 14 months. So here I am on another search for one that isn't junk."
1,Prepare for the sales job,"This books is pure tongue in cheek hype--but it's also the only comprehensive overview you'll find on defining what ""websphere"" is and does. Here's the big spoiler--ready? websphere=EJB..."
1,"I'm not a Segal fan, so maybe my vote doesn't count...","I was never a fan of Steven Segal. I found his movies a lot like Van Dam's -- pure action, no plot and little (if any) notable actors. This film is no exception. The other main stars are Morris Chestnut (spelling?) and Ja Rule...wow what a relief! The films plot evolves around an undercover FBI agent (Segal -- of course!) who gets busted with a stolen car (just a cover) with his criminal friend (Ja Rule). Their sent to the pen and soon after the pen is taking over by a group of 'terrorist?' who want some money they are owed. Not much plot, too much action, no good actors and little (if any) direction. No wonder this film stayed in post-production for almost two-years -- Steven Segal, please quit deluting our cinema with this garbage!"
1,lost music,"this cd is not what it is advertised to be , the song american pie is at least 7 minutes long , on this cd it is only 2 minutes long,you buy this cd for the song american pie and you want to hear all of it' .i bought a second one for a friend and could not cancell i will return it and buy my cds somewhere else jok"
1,Not as good as the first,"I really looked forward to downloading this one. I ended up not reading it. I just wasn't sure that I wanted to spend my time with this subject matter. I may go back to it, but doubtful"
1,what?,"this is the last time i buy a movie based on reviews. this movie absolutely sucked. gore? you've got to be kidding. the plot sucked, the effects sucked, it made no sense. the soundtrack was the best part of the film. the cast was great and it had lots of potential but fell way short of anything but 1 star. next time i will research the people writing reviews more than the movie itself to make sure they have an idea of what they are commenting on. 101 5 star idiots and counting."
1,"Some good, some poor quality","I don't know of any other company that sells such a variety of opaque, colorful tights. I bought a large number of them and didn't discover that some were damaged before the return date had expired. When they are good, they are very, very good and when they are bad... it's a waste.I hope they will step up their quality control."
1,It just gets worse and worse,"I've been using Office since the DOS versions, and I have to say, I have never liked it. Using it professionally in a publishing environment, I have to say that this is probably its worst incarnation yet. The office assistant is gone, but in his place are a variety of pop-ups and warnings which cannot be turned off. Outlook has not become any more secure, it is simply more paranoid, forcing you to save any attachment to disc, regardless. Word remains unstable, ugly, and functionally gruesome. It is one of the few software applications which can routinely crash my Windows XP system.If we hadn't standardised upon a number of VBA macros we had devloped in house, some years ago, we would almost certainly ditch this product and use something else. We should never have standardised upon this software: it was one of the worst business decisions we, as a company, ever made."
1,Problem,"This cord did not work, we could not speak. We returned this item, and decided to buy it local so we could easily return it if we had further problems. The local store cord worked fine. It also cost more."
1,regarding Mona Lisa 3,"Is it just me or does it seem like she took Laurell K. Hamilton and Anne Bishop, threw them in a blender and this is the result??"
1,Good Fun?,"This is a fun movie if you like the romantic comedy.Why 1 star?? There is a scene where an old woman calls ayoung German couple ""facists"". The irony is, the old lady is Italian. Whoever wrote the scene doesn't own I history book Iguess. That's a little on the predjudice side for me and it didn't belong in a comedy. I'm glad the couple weren't African-American, I wonder what she would have called them.Don't support this garbage by buying it, loan it from your library."
1,What went wrong,No No No. This was a flop; I was so disappointed when I listened to the album. His previous album Forever was so good and now this what went wrong? Please tell me.This is realty not worth looking at!
1,Not 25 in a box...,"These seem sturdy enough, and basic black, but I was inclined to count the contents since other reviewers mentioned getting shorted. They were right! I ordered two boxes, one had 25, but the other 24! What's up with that?"
1,Not God Inspired,"The Book of Songs of Solomon Chapter 1 verse 5 is suppose to read as follows. I am Black and comly, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, as the tents of ken-dar, as the curtains of Solomon. Chapter 5 verse 11 reads as follows, His head is as the most fine gold, his locks are bushy. This Bible reads Chapter 1 verse 5 reads as follows. I am dark but lovely, O daughters of Jerusalem, Like the tents of Ke'dar, like the curtian of Solomon. chapter 5 verse 11 reads.. His head is like the finest gold, His locks are wavey, and as black as a raven. Until the Gentile could come though the isle of Javon there was no white race. Science has proved that all races come from the Black race. The bible should be a book of truths not lies."
1,"OK watch, LOUSY SERVICE!","Tissot is owned by Omega. They have ONE service center in the USA. According to my jeweler, they sometimes have gone on strike for up to 6 months. Every time I have had to send my watch back for ANY service, it has taken over 2 months to get it back. The last time was 10 weeks and counting. If you like to buy a watch to wear from time to time ONLY...then go ahead and buy one. The battery WILL run down, and you will have to send it on in, for more $$$ and wait and see if it comes back in 2 months!"
1,YAWNING,"Michelle Branch's music could be clumped together in the same genre as bands like Matchbox Twenty and Train. I.E. people who think they're being 'alternative' or 'edgy'. Some may call it pop/rock but it is really more pop than rock. Michelle lacks in the lyric department tremendously to ever be compared to Alanis Morissette. Many of her songs blend together and sound the same. I admit, I kinda liked 'Desperately' and 'Till I Get Over You' but the rest was so boring and bland. Sorry Michelle, but I'd rather listen to Alanis Morissette, early Jewel, PJ Harvey, or Tori Amos anyday than you."
1,The Princess,This was the first novel I have ever read by Lori Wick. I usually read books by the same Publishing House and I wanted to try something different. I found it to be a disapointment.The story was easy reading but the storyline was predictable. Nothing exciting about it.
1,Disappointing Film,The buzz surrounding this film is overdone. You do feel as though you're there in the arctic but the plot is claustrophobic and lacks perspective. You could get cabin fever watching this movie so have a backup pick handy!
1,Dissapointing Low quality hair dryer,"I ordered this conair hairdryer to replace a different model conair hairdryer that was great but had stopped working after 3 years of heavy use. From the first time I used this model I found the airflow to be weak. After using it twice, the words next to the settings had smeared and are now almost completely rubbed off.Do not buy this model."
1,ugh!,"Is there sucha thing as NO STARS? I was told I could program my Ipod on my Windows ME Gateway computer using this disc...packaging on disc box and case says same...It has turned out to be a bust...no can do...money down the drain. Anyone want to buy it and try it? ...It was a waste of money to me. No instructions, no phone support to get help WHILE trying to utelize it ..BUST. MY Ipod still isn't programmed..,.another waste of money as it turns out..to date..purchased week before Christmas..."
1,Misplaced acting,The actor doesn't crontribue with the plot (whic is already very weak( and the result is a totally forgetable movie. The shark action is a shame.
1,Not for the stubborn at heart,"Unfortunately my dog must be more stubborn then most. She is a spirited West Highland Terrier who feels it is her responsibility to bark if the wind blows...unfortunately the neighbors don't feel the same way! The collar sprays and she literally continues to bark through it, even as it continues to spray again and again. She could care less! Ugggh. I guess I will have to try the shock collar:("
1,Lies entertainingly presented,... However this book is entertaining in that it shows how one person can deceive themself while attempting to deceive others. Avoid this book and instead try reading a good John Grisham novel like his latest one.
1,Did not Work for me,"I bought this Adapter to connect my Accoustimass speakers in the pre-wired room and only one Channel (Left) worked, remaining did not work at all. I know the wires are all working as I can hear sound when I insert the wires into the left channel (the only channel that works)"
1,Not that good,"I read many opinions on this album and while we all know what opinions are like, I thought I would write my own.I found this album very disappointing. It sounds very rushed and converge really needs two guitarists. There is a gem or two on this record but they could have done much better. Nobody wants to hear high pitchy whiney guitar chords over and over again. That stopped being artistic when slipknot overdid it. Sorta like when ashton kutcher started wearing his hat crooked on punk'd, but that's another matter. ....anyhow Jane Doe was amazing. When forever comes crashing was amazing. I heard the song plagues from no heros and that sounds much better. More so than 90% of You fail me at least. I really did try to give you fail me a chance since I paid money for it, but it is pretty much crap compared to all of their other records."
1,crap,"Ill keep this short. This movie is basically a group of clever camera tricks strung together with a half hearted storyline. The creator(s) do not know how to create an engaging movie. Had I seen some of these clips online or something, I would say they were cool looking and clever. But as an actual theatrical movie? It does not hold up. Not to mention the fact that there is talent out there that has worked their entire lives to make movies, just to have a nobody acidentally create something like this and have it catch on for some reason. Blair Witch was three times the movie this is."
1,Bluebird Lays an Egg,"Ok I am like very disapointed with this film Shirley didn't get the role of Dorthy in The Wizard of OZ And so made this similar fantasy,based on a famous children's play. Shirley enters the land of death to seek the blue bird of happiness.It was her last child role she was 12 at the time. I feel very bad because she was the greatest actress and she was still adorable at the age of12 .I don't really understand why people say she was stiff exactly. She dances to Laydeo with her grandfather while she visits them.Don't get me wrong though, I thought the movie was quite good until the color part the rest was junk. It was quite cheesey with the fire and I don't understand the point of it. I though of it as a let-down for everyone. After her first flop her acting career as a child was over quite a sad story indeed"
1,Watch what you buy,I purchased this CD from a independent seller and what I received was not what Amazon is listing.Before you buy ask if it is am Original Master Recording by Mobile Fidelity
1,BAD DECISION,"Bought these for my husband for Christmas and they have never worked. Contacted company for assistance, but they were wholly unhelpful and unwilling to do anything about it. I will never purchase a product from this company again."
1,Thank God they don't exist anymore,"Heroes del Silencio are the most boring in Spain. Their singer is an insult to all the good vocalists in the history of music; he's impossible to take seriously and his lyrics don't make sense at all (and I'm Spanish). OK, they are a very efficient solution when you are sleepless. If you want to listen to some rock music in Spanish, try Barón Rojo, Rosendo, Leño, Extremoduro, Los Suaves, Mago de Oz... Then you will realise that there's actual talent in Spanish rock musicians. Summing up: Heroes del Silencio is a forgettable band and I don't understand why they were so successful. Don't bother in listening to them, your life will be happier and longer."
1,I give up,"All I'm wanting is something that doesn't fall out of my ear, doesn't break in less than 6 months, and has decent audio quality. I've tried ten different Bluetooth earpieces, and all of them have issues. This is the latest. Worked wonderfully last night -- even used it. Charged it over night... and now when I make calls, the other ends hears the WORST static ever.I'm going back to my wired headset. This is just too hard."
1,"Stick with ""The Plege""","The American version of this film is infinitely better. And not just because it has an all-star cast and a newly competent Sean Penn. He redeems himself for the reprehensible ""Indian Runner"" and ""Crossing Guard."" No, while those are good and valid reasons to see the American film they are not the most compelling. The most compelling reasons to steer clear of this film are these: 1) It is the only film I've seen that contains a scene where two grown men play patty cake in their underwear. (No this is not a obscere euphemism it is literally what happens. 2) It is the only movie I've seen where a psychopath shaves his genitals on camera. 3. It doesn't have the same ending as the American film. (I currently have the novel on order from Amazon but I don't know how it ends.) If you liked the Pledge as much as I did you probably won't heed my warning, so the best piece of advice I can give you is this: it is available new from a few websites...."
1,Didn't last long,The ratchet broke with my wife using it to break loose a torx screw. Not a quality ratchet in the kit.
1,Sony disappoints again - Not 12 players but only 1,"The graphics are great and the play exceptional, but if you were looking to share the experience with anyone else, other than on-line, forget it. THIS IS A SINGLE PLAYER GAME, which is hard to believe in a racing game. Isn't the whole point of racing, to compete against someone else? Yes, you can compete on-line, but all of that side-by-side interaction is lost. I had waited for this release so that I could play side-by-side against my brothers and friends, but not with this title. Perhaps if EA Sports had released it, it would have lived up to its billing. Sorry Sony, you again deliver less than the hype."
1,Defective phone,"I bought two phones, one of them drops connection to the base every few seconds, then says ""system is starting up"". Searched on the internet, turns out A LOT of people have this problem. Called Linksys support, they started assuring me it's my router / internet provider settings, etc., until I insisted that one of the phones is defective (the other works fine with the same precise set-up).Waiting for a replacement now but I'm kind of sorry I bought into this whole thing; I wasted way too much time on this. It is also kind of puzzling Linsys does not perform proper quality control on their phones (apparently this problem has been around for at least a year), and ships defective hardware. I will take notice of that for my future shopping..."
1,Interesting premise but shallow writing,"I agree with some previous reviewers that the character development is thin, the format is annoying, and the ending is manipulative. The author's hand is so visible in this book that I could never lose sight of it. In spite of a good premise, the story never reaches its potential. Someone told me that it was a well-done view into the teenage mind. For that purpose I would suggest the book ""Miss American Pie"" by Margaret Sartor instead."
1,Meh...,"A few good songs, but in general, I'm not digging it. If you're a fan of ""old"" Saves the Day, this CD is not for you..."
1,There's nothing I can say,"After being assured the book was in stock, I received an email informing me that it WAS NOT in stock."
1,these are not the real SHADOWS .,please get your shadows right. the real shadows are the English group.Please set these right.thank you.
1,Marginally psychotic balderdash?,"At the risk of sounding like a literary philistine, I must say that I didn't get it. There was some really neat stuff, but it rambled on and on and I didn't catch the connections. Is this one of those works where you need to be warmed up on some good acid, or maybe a devotee of obscure occultist literature? Maybe my problem is that I've been clean and sober over ten years, or maybe because I have a Ph.D. in psychology. I don't know. I plan to read Illuminatus and see if I can make sense of that one. I think I gave it a good run for the money--I read the entire first part basically in one sitting while waiting for my wife to shop for clothes, partly in a Starbuck's coffee shop and partly on a sunny patio outside a Middle Eastern deli during an unseasonably warm day in January, in Austin, Texas. I usually make marginal notes in the books I read, and in this one all I could find, scribbled inside the front cover, was: Marginally psychotic balderdash?"
1,What they didn't tell you,"I purchased this card, mainly for price and lack of research. I plugged it in. It does do well for video, for high resolution display, but it cannot deal with 2D games. It butcherizes them...I mean bad. In fact, one game would't play untill I went back to the old 4mb Vcard. The games it did poorly with were Axis and Allies,and Army Men 2. My son won't let me put it back. Anyone want this card cheap? When you upgrade card it shouldn't fail on older software."
1,What is advertised is NOT what I got :/ Very upset,I'm an artist and really into Salvador Dali. I had seen the short film Destino on a friends copy of Fantasia 2000 dvd & was obsessed. I had to have it! I ordered this because there's a video in the images section and in the description it says it includes the Destino bonus film and I got a version of Fantasia that doesn't even have it! I'm really pissed off! Don't advertise that it's on there if you send copies without it! It's really the whole reason I ordered this film. I hope Amazon accepts this item back even though I've opened it :/
1,LA MUERTE DEL OYENTE,"El tema "" Como te voy a olvidar "" fue galardonado como el mejor representante de la pobreza de inspiracion , los mismos compases de repiten indifinidamente haciendo caer al oyente en un sopor indescriptible . Ya en el primer tercio el oyente pierde su individualidad para ir perdiendose luego sin retorno posible . Los mismos compases machacan su buen gusto , su aspiracion a escuchar sonidos armonicos y ni el mismo llega a entender que es lo que esta sonando. En un segundo tercio la atencion se pierde definitivamente , baja la presion , se entristece el rostro y una laxitud echa por tierra toda energia . Los ultimos compases ya ni llegan a ser percibidos y el hombre... desaparece ."
1,Seen and Tasted Better than this one,"I was sort of dissappointed by this book. I thought that the recipes should have been nicer then they really was. I think that everything turned out a little bit dry, but I think that was my fault and not Mrs. Jains. The introduction to this book also left me confuesd. There is another Indian food author, Dalal something, she is better."
1,Hole Puncher,I hate this hole puncher!!! it has many problems like it says it can cut 10 piece of paper it can't even cut one piece of paper it was just a wast of money.
1,Not Made for the Car,"It is smaller than OEM filter, falls into the air cleaner box, does not stay there as it should. Not made for the car it says was made for.Uneven foam gasket construction. Cardboard-like cheap paper element. Made in Mexico."
1,"one of the worst books I have ever read - completely useless...,","This book offers very little insight and simply states the obvious. You will read page after page of over-generalized, useless information. The chapter on laundry lists 12 brands of laundry detergent. So what? I thought that this book would offer not only guidance and insight pertaining to the philosophy of simplifying, I thought it would offer useful, practical advice. It offers neither. It spends more time telling you that life is complicated without delving into how you can actually simplify it. I already know its complicated! Furthermore, the book is rife with sentences like this; ""State-of-the-art washing machines and dryers are readily available. If you don't have them in your home, then you can go to a nearby coin laundry."" Really? I totally needed a book to figure that out, thank you!"
1,"no pictures, lots of sugar substitute","Normally I don't buy cookbooks without photos since photos add a lot of information to a recipe. But I was looking for a low carb cookbook and this was on remainder. I was very surprised to find that ""sugar equivalent sweetener"" was called for in most of the recipes, even recipes like pork chops. I don't like the taste of fake sugar, so that made the recipes unappealing. Some of the recipes were trivial, such as Baked Chicken Thighs (only thighs and salt), and others were page fillers where the 'recipe' was ""Chocolate Ricotta Pudding"" - which simply told you to add chocolate to the Ricotta Pudding recipe."
1,"NOT ""Ultra Quiet""","I see other reviews to the contrary, but the one we got was FAR from silent. The other attributes of this pet drinking fountain appear to be accurate. The sound level, however, is more like a coffee grinder than a 'silent' fountain. We checked all the applicable trouble-shooting tips, such as making sure the pump was properly secured to the bottom on its suction cups, and also making sure there was sufficient water in the system for the pump to function properly. Still, quite loud. The cat reacted to it like it was a killer robot from space. Returned it and got the Drinkwell, which also has some pump noise, but it is well masked by the sound of the splashing water, which seems to appeal to the kitty, rather than repelling her."
1,"a junk, avoid","if you have an average size or bigger head, there is no way you can wear it. even if you have a small head, you can not comfortably wear it with its cheap palstic holder. if you want to waste your time and money, it is a good choice."
1,An insult to Thai people,"This ""dictionary"" is a collection of phrases that promote the stereotype that all Thai women are prostitutes...and all Thai men pimps. On top of this basic supposition, the phrases are not the words that we Thais would even use! Imagine if some ghetto trash guest on Jerry Springer had dictated a dictionary and then pronounced the words."
1,Smaller Than It Should Be,"The film itself is fine, but the area it covers is much too small. I was really hoping for more of an edge-to-edge protection that this film offers."
1,JUNK,I have bought many things from amazon and never before had a problem with anything. I buy online all the time and have never had to write a negative review before. No led light? OEM? Not even close to original!!! It only works if I hold the plug into the cigarette lighter socket otherwise it falls out. I'm not out that much money so my biggest regret is amazon doesn't provide negative stars for rating.
1,Leaves a whole lot to be desired,"Less than adequate. You can learn a few things from this book, but the design really didn't offer me enough examples and applications of command syntax. Anyone who wants to see how this book should be written needs to take a look at the format offered in ""The Little Blue SAS Book"". I guess it spoiled me from any future computer user guides. In addition, the Syntax manual (PDF) that comes with SPSS offers a searchable guide that can give you everything this book offers in no time at all."
1,I like some types of Korn...............,"but this movie was way too corny for my tastes. This movie managed to use every single cliché that ever existed. This ranges from the group of misfits going on an adventure to save their home from evil corporate rich people to mobsters with guns to a pirate treasure cave filled with booby traps to a fat kid who saves the day to a disfigured grotesque monster suddenly gaining human knowledge and capabilities and rebelling against it's owners to love between two 13 year olds. The reason that I gave this movie two stars is because there are worse films than this one and one scene was funny. Other than that, I do not recommend this film to anyone who likes hardy boys and other meaningless kids detective stories."
1,Not sure this is actually new,"This item took longer than expected to arrive, and when it finally did i was extremely disappointed in the contents. the wire cage and base itself are fine. The wheel and ladder are not as they appear in the picture. The house was broken and covered in some kind of black film that i can't scrub off. There are no directions only pictures! The wheel seems to have pretty sharp edges and so does the house. I'm going to request replacement parts and hope for the best i suppose. Overall i thought this was a deal for the cost, but it turns out its worth exactly what you pay, which is not much."
1,Pump has very low pressure,I lost the box or I would have sent this back. It is not worth the money. The flow is poor. My mistake! I had a 3GPM that was too much so I chose a 2 GPM. This pump is probably a 1/2 or 1 GPM pump. I use this on my tractor to water my plants and add fertilizer. I wanted a low flow pump so it wouldn't destroy the plants but this is way too low.
1,Terrible writing by non-DBAs,"This book reads like it's written by a couple of high schoolers who didn't have their grammar teacher look over their work before it got into print. It reads a lot like the incomprehensible nonsense on Hotek's Web site. It also reads like the people who wrote it aren't actually SQL Server admins. It reads like they're consultants. I don't think these guys would know the daily life of a DBA if it jumped up and bit them on the a$$. Hotek in particular is a singularly bad writer. One sentence fragment after another litters his work. After seeing this, I will never trust another thing Hotek says."
1,Piece of garbage,"This player is a complete piece of garbage. Not ready for prime-time, but it was still rushed to the market. While the picture quality is excellent (when it successfully plays DVDs) as you would expect with the HD-DVD format, it takes up to *2 minutes* to load up a DVD and start playing it. Just performing a power-up boot takes at least a minute. In addition it does not play DVD+R discs. In many cases it would not play any disc you insert into it and required several reboots to play it correctly. I returned mine immediately and instead got a Denon 1080p-upconverting player and am happy with the picture quality.Bottom line: Toshiba's HD DVD players are not yet ready for prime-time. Besides, with the annoying fact that there are 2 competing formats for hi-def DVD (VHS vs Betamax all over again) I am going to wait until HD-DVD or Blu-Ray is declared the winner."
1,thermometer,"Not water proof fogs up quick but, quite accurate readings needs some of the silicone sealant on it to last longer"
1,"Too ""easy-listening"" for my taste....","and for that matter too calculated, tame, or harmless. As others have said, it does grow on you, but there's not much of a sense of urgency (unlike its predicessors.) Like the Strokes, with each new album, their music seems to be getting less relevant. Nonetheless, worth getting, no ""skip-tracks"" per se....I like ""sea legs,"" ""phantom limb"" and ""split needles"" the best. Don't make this your first Shins album though..."
1,Died after 15 months,"Installed this unit, which was manufactured 12/06, in my Wife's car in June 08. Died Sept 09 just after the 1 year warranty ran out. It won't make a sound...won't accept a CD...but all the lights are on. I checked all the connections and they look fine. Apparently this isn't unusual for this unit, from other reports I ready. Beware. Sony offers only one warranty repair, a $79 exchange for a refurd, which includes shipping. Too bad for Sony that I can buy an new radio from another manufacturer for the same price! Not the first quality issue I have had with Sony's quality over the past ten years. Sony...you and I are definitely through."
1,Complete BS,"Programmers *don't* duplicate programs??? I don't know where this London reviewer learned to program, but here in the 'States, us Yanks have learned the *best* programmers are the *truest* plagarists. To borrow from Picasso, ""good artists copy, great artists steal"". If I can't *use* the examples in this book (as some reviewers have mentioned), then the book is as useful as an Apple III.Yet the chap from London and I agree on one thing: all of the information in this book was found on the Internet, and what wasn't there or here was in the Karl Moss book (example: dynamically building JAR files on client requests. Now that's *reusable*, *useful* code)."
1,This Game Sucked,"I think that THIS GAME SUCKED u know nba live is the better game and i think that it sucked that they took out creat a coac, when the coaches actually matter now, DINT GET ME WRONG i like and bought the game, but i think that the orice was outragous, compared to ESPN i think that the better buy is NBA LIVE2004! IT IS BETTER THAN this GAMEGO ANDY REED AND gYYY RANT"
1,Buy this if you like pour money down the toilet,This is a bad controller to get. Madcatz usually makes the worst peripherals out of any other maker. With the advances in PS3 firmware it has made some USB wireless devices null and void.
1,Intermediate user,"I've been happy with SystemWorks 2000 on my previous computer, so when I bought a new XP machine, I bought 2003 for it. In retrospect, that was a waste of good money. I've now spent about 5 hours trying to install it without any good results. The catch seems to be that I had bought their previous product, and when I transferred my files, it transferred likewise. I've uninstalled every bit of the previous edition that I can even using Norton's own SYMClean utility. That utility tells me there is no trace remaining, but when I try to install the new version, it tells me otherwise. Short of opening up the registry and trying to purge it of references to NSW, I'm resigned to saying goodbye to the [money] bucks I paid for it. Any advice on something simpler and more reliable? Symantec essential has no live support unless you're willing to spend [money] more without a guarantee that the product will work."
1,It is a bit outdated by now.,I found a lot of the sites were no longer available. The prices that were offered by the companies were not wholesale in my opinion.
1,seller doesn't know what's goin on,"had trouble with seller. email her several times and never got back to me. when she finally did. she said she was not aware of the ""sale"" so i went ahead and ordered another book elsewhere and asked seller for a refund. She said ""NO... she already sent it out."" but how can u send a product out if you haven't even got paid and know nothing about it? recived book from seller... didn't open it and returned book to seller."
1,Lack of depth but somewhat good overview,"This is somewhat a good overview of a particular way to attack the multi-sensor fusion problem. The authors always refer and somtimes present their own work on the subject.However, this book gathers different parts of reference publications (which I did not have access to) and was misleading. For example, some algorithms were not fully explained and therefore hard to reproduce.If you are looking for a thorough explanation of the key concepts, this is not the book because it presents three solutions, focusing on the authors'."
1,How Dissapointing.,"I loved version 2.0 and the original Garbage because of how different they were. They were a hard type of electronica rock, they did all types of music ranging from pop, to jazz, alternative, hip hop, a little bit of country, and of course rock. This entire cd sounds like Britney Spears to me. Everything sounds so incredibly fake. It sounds like those little kiddie keyboards you buy.. and Shirley Mansons vocals has lost it's touch entirely lost in all this. True the lyrics might be deeper and more personal but some words that seem to be sad lose the feeling when there sang in these throw away happy go lucky poppish songs.Don't get me wrong, pop is great to listen to. Just... not this kind. And if you are into teen pop and music like this.. think about it.. would you rather this kind of music being performed by (Ugh) Nsync and 98 degrees, or a bunch of 40 year olds who have lost there touch?"
1,what did I miss?,I thought this movie was bad. I am going to throw away my copy. The actors were unprofessional and silly. I just did not like this movie and I am angry at myself for buying it. Like I said: What did I miss? Total waste of my time.
1,Arrived in unusable condition,"Not only did the bar arrive in a tattered box, but it came missing the rubber pad for one end of the bar. This piece was necessary for use, and thus the bar was unusable and a complete waste of money."
1,Good for showing how pathetic humanity is.,"The Nazis and Stalinists are like two tribes of psychopathic monkeys, jumping up and down and pointing at the other side screaming ""They're even worse than us."" This book presents the official line of the nazi monkeys. It's interesting in the sense that the old WW2 propaganda battle is still going strong in some quarters."
1,"Pretty, but doesn't work well. Skagen didn't repair well either.","While this watch is very nice looking and I love the design, it doesn't work so well. The small hand in mine doesn't keep up and always looks an hour behind. I had it repaired once after only owning it for 9 months. EVEN UNDER WARRANTY, Skagen charged me $13 to repair it plus shipping cost. After less than a year, it's broken again and I went to the website and they want $34 to repair a watch. Plus I have to pay to ship it to them. The watch costs less than $100 so at this point, I'll just toss the thing. Too bad they concentrate mnore on design than function."
1,"too broad, not enough detail","In my opinion, this book could have whittled down the number of entries, and told us more about each subject. And more importantly, shown us more than one photo of each entry.I mean, can one photo of Linda E. suffice?"
1,"Bad editor, Good Author","The editor of this book should say sorry to the book author as he/she made this book with so many errors. He/she needs to learn basic editing skill. By the way, if I am the hire, I will fire him/her on the spot."
1,Microsoft Plus for Windows XP,"This product has very little to offer. The Plus for Windows 98 was more interesting and offered more 'extras'.This product doesn't have much on it, not worth the money."
1,Didn't help in carrier,"My cat absolutely hates being in her carrier which makes trips to the vet even more miserable. I bought this because I've heard it helps for short-term situations such as this. Well, I saw zero change. She was yowling and thrashing around just as much as before. I followed the instructions on the back and allowed enough time between spraying and using the carrier. Guess I'm just one of the unlucky ones. I'll give it 1 star for me since there was no change, but it apparently works for others. Luckily I was able to return it with no questions asked."
1,Listen to it before you buy!,"The comparison I keep coming across to Wilson Philips is all too true. Most of the tunes on this album start to wear on the brain after a second or third listening. Part of the reason for this is the noticeable absence of anything pioneering or new. Their attempt at intermingling traditional Irish music with pop is promising on tracks such as ""dreams,"" but the rest of the album leaves me desiring more. The fantastic remixes of ""so young"" and ""dreams"" proves this band needs an infusion of some upbeat music to spice up what I would catagorize as an older, wilson philips era, sound."
1,It just enforces the stereotypes!,"This book *seemed* to have good intentions, but fell REALLY short. I think I was turned off right away by the full-page glamour shot of the author and her husband on the back cover.This book seems to make the assumption that most younger women/older men relationships break up marriages, cause turmoil within families, etc. The author seems to use this book as some sort of pet project to tell the world about her sob story. I didn't learn a thing from reading this book, and was disappointed to see that it just re-enforces the stereotypes about younger women that date older men. We're not all homewreckers, for pete's sake! We're not all bimbos with no aspirations! I still am looking for a decent book on this subject."
1,Flimsy headphones. They break very easily.,"I'm not especially rough on my gear but I've had to tape these ""sports"" headphones up three times after they kept breaking. They are really brittle. They break off at the part above the earphones and the middle part that goes over your head They do sound good but just don't handle them alot and be very careful when putting them on or taking them off because they don't bend well, they just snap. You may think I'm over exagerating but I'm not. You need to slip them off very gingerly or else you'll end up with two or more pieces in both hands.I've had other sports headphones before that were far more durable (and flexible). After these are gone for good I'm getting another brand. I recommed you keep looking for a different brand as well."
1,to good to be true,So far this battery is living up to the rest of the reviews. If something is to good to be true then it is. i got this battery because after fours years of having my original battery packs they are lasting no more than 30 minutes. Saw these on here and figure i would order one and see how it it is. My battery i just got with my new silver controller will last me at least a week worth of playing this one last me about a days worth. You get what you pay for..... spend the extra cash and a white battery. I bought the pink one
1,Not a reliable product,"This printer did well for only a short time.It was a second printer and RARELY used to actually print anything. It was purchased to scan slides. The printer was expensive at $400.I had it only for a year plus when I got a error message that would not allow the printer to work (U052). I replaced all the ink tanks (this was the first time any of the ink tanks were replaced (very expensive) and still received the error that the printhead needed replacement. The printhead is $80-110. The printer will not do anything without this printhead being replaced.After looking online regarding the error it was evident that this was a design error, not only in the MP960 but other Canon printers.This printer is not recommended by me."
1,Woody El Pajaro Loco,Was terrible - voice quality just terrible. Would not recommend anyone to purchase it. Save your money. I wish I would have never bought it.
1,Frustrating !!!,"This game is totally frustrating. We don't spend hours a day playing but we have completed several other games that are supposed to be more difficult, my 6 year old can just complete a few levels by himself, most of the time I have to be there to complete other levels and I can hardly complete them, honestly sometimes I just want to throw it to the garbage. I don't recommend it, it may be ok for 10 year olds who are experts with video games. I will get rid of mine."
1,"Noisy spacebar, hard to depress keys","I bought the MS Natural Ergo 4000 to replace a MS Natural Keyboard Elite. I thought the Ergo would be a step up but the extra features were not sufficient to overcome its drawbacks. I returned it to Amazon and have ordered another Elite.The spacebar on the Ergo is loose and clicks loudly each time I depress it. Depressing all other keys takes more pressure than I'm accustomed to using. The distance between keys and the size of some keys is different than the Elite. Perhaps, with time, I would have come to appreciate those differences, but the other issues were enough to preclude my taking that time."
1,"Disappointing new arrangements; voice OK, no longer great.","This CD looked promising from the label, but was so disappointing I returned it. Andrews' original performances of many of these standards, such as those from My Fair Lady, were absolutely gorgeous. For some inexplicable reason, in an effort to ""improve"" on these standards, the arrangements have been all mangled. They contain unexpected modulations and other strange changes which make the listener want to grab the original recording-which is what I did for My Fair Lady. Julie Andrews' original recordings of many of these songs were sublime. Unfortunately, these retakes remind us that her voice isn't what it once was, as she too often talks her way through the songs and avoids the jumps and high notes that she used to hit in clear, thrilling fashion."
1,disappointing,"This is the second Dumpy book I've gotten to read to my 5 year old, and the second one in which I've been disappointed. The plot is choppy. One second the rich lady is appealing to the paper to write an article about the collection, the next they're driving to the United Nations? And what's with the African Children's Choir that is almost entirely white?The general idea of charity and things working out for the best is commendable, but I felt the execution left much to be desired."
1,Looked nice when new but later......,"This ring looked nice when new. The description states it's sterling silver. My wife wore it for about two weeks and the shiny finish started to peel. I assumed it was solid sterling, but it appears to be plated with sterling silver. A darker silver colored metal is under the peeled surface. I would not buy this item again."
1,disappointing!,"(if i was to give it another rating it would be 1 star)...bad photoquality, bad quality all the way. if you have serious interest i shamanism steer clear! it could have been cut down to about 15-20 minutes of useful information, but the quality of the pictures is totally crap - amateurish! the shaman in this documentary is fine enough, but doesn`t give the impression of being of the most advanced (not the one you travel half the world to see in person). sympathic and straightforward, honest..but more a traditional curer/curandero. this movie gives nothing to the ones interested in the study of consciousness. very disappointing! made of and for people with little knowledge and interest i shamanism."
1,"I LOVED this bag, until now!","I have the Eddie Bauer backpack and used that when my son was a month or two old, but soon grew tired of fussing with getting items out of it while holding a baby.So I looked for an easier access bag and found this Eddie Bauer one.I loved this bag because I just had to sling it over my shoulder and could easily access the contents of the bag while holding my son.I've had this bag since the summer and its now a piece of junk. The inside lining is torn and the actual strap is tearing off of the back of the bag (where its attached).Plus, this bag doesn't hold much and is much smaller than it appears to be.It was an excellent bag until it began to fall apart.I'd recommend looking for a different bag."
1,Backward-looking,"I leave it to you to judge how seriously to take this book from a quote within it:""While the tonal system, in an atrophied or vestigial form, is still used today in popular and commercial music, and even occasionally in the works of backward-looking serious composers, it is no longer employed by serious composers of the mainstream. It has been replaced or succeeded by the 12-tone system."""
1,tupperware seals storage,I did not like this product. It would not fit in any of my cupboards. It was a waste of money!
1,Good while it lasted,I bought this product from Amazon 2 years ago. It is pretty good quality for an FM transmitter. I was very disappointed when it started falling apart though. I didn't abuse the product. The black casing around the wires started ripping so that the wires were exposed. One wire became severed. Tried to fix with electrical tape...didn't work. The product became useless. Griffin Technology wasn't able to replace because they only offer 1 year warranty. :-(
1,Poor work,This is a poor exegetical work by Tony. He doesn't do his best. There are far better works to consider.
1,Not a book for a quick review,I wouldn't highly recomend this book for students who want a quick fact review before the exam. The book would however be good for students who might have trouble writing or organizing essays. The only part of the book I found really helpful was the outline at the back of the book which goes over such things as causes of various wars and famous people. I used that to review the nigh before the exam. But be forwarned if you do buy this bok to help you with the essay it will take you a while to read!
1,A Sudden and Unsatisfying Ending,"This book is very densely plotted...too much so. There are too many characters and details, making it a tough slog.But the real reason I feel compelled to share my experience (and, as a writer, I shy away from criticizing others' efforts) is that the ending is so incredibly abrupt, making me wonder if they edited it down for the paperback version. We join the climactic scene after it is already well in progress...I thought I was missing some pages but I wasn't. And everything is suddenly wrapped up in a page and a half. Given where the story stood, I thought another 50 pages remained and were needed. Turns out those pages were a preview of his next book.As it was, it was all work and little payoff. And the main characters didn't really draw me in like Laura Lippman's Tess or Larry Block's Matt Scudder.I admire the author's plotting skills and knowledge, but there's an editor who did him a real disservice."
1,"Pretty Pictures, not much else","While the graphic presention in this book is excellent, the content is sorely lacking in detail. This is more of an idea book than an instructional one. Their rating system for degree of difficulty is completely innaccurate. Removing front coil springs is rated as more difficult than tasks like replacing the upper control arms (which require removing the front coil springs!) or even front rack and pinion conversions, which are extremely difficult. If you are looking for ideas on some possible projects, this is an OK book, although the information is widely available elsewhere. If you are looking for in depth instruction, this one is all sizzle and no steak."
1,BE SKEPTICAL,I am trying to replace the battery on an older model. There are four screws of different sizes requiring different screw drivers. The smaller are impossible to turn with a fine driver. The engineering is suspect unless intended to be disposable. Have the store demonstrate a battery change. Poor design. I would be hesitant to trust the newer design. For a relatively brief time it did read temperatures quickly.
1,another CGI animated cartoon,"another CGI animated cartoon? As if all movie genres aren't saturated with CGI enough. I saw the non cartoon movie back in 1990 or 1991 so why do i need to watch a kiddie CGI cartoon with whiny kids in the theatre who are always talking or screaming or kids who are always flashing their cell phone lights every 2 minutes like it's some kind of rave in the movie theatre. For you kids who has to flash your cell phone lights ever minute or so, it's very annoying to the people who are sitting behind you in a stadium seating."
1,Ppppplllllleeeeaaassee,"When I saw it at the theater with a group of other middle aged friends, I enjoyed it; but watching it again alone in my living room, I felt like, why bother?? Being with my friends the first time gave me the opportunity to voyeour their watching it.While some of the characters and events in the film are true, the love story aspect was just too sappy. Give me a break. Danny dies and Raf gets the girl, the baby and the happily ever after.The love story really distracted from the story line. Special effects were good, though, as well as the music. I bought the soundtrack hoping to relive some of the 40s magic, but it was mostly orchestral with just that one song by Faith Hill. I had to find another CD with classic 40s music to enjoy."
1,Its like a glob of clay...no definate shape,"The main part of the album is the same old screaming and power chords. Like clay, for the most part its formless. I mean, the first five aongs are okay, but after that its just the same old some old. i hope you agreee, filter has seen much better days. And by the way, heyman nice shot isnt that good, okay? Posers...."
1,Annoying,"After 60 pages, I switched to ""C# Programming Guide"" from Visual Studio Documentation - in my opinion the same contents, but better written, and navigation is easier. Bottom line: waste of money."
1,A terrible book about the Gold Rush.,"""Against All Odds: The Lucy Scott Mitchum Story"" is about an extremely interesting topic - the Gold Rush and how families packed up what they could fit into a covered wagon and begin a new life in states which offered wealth and prosperity - but this story was very dull and mundane. At points, the story dragged on and on and then a split second later, it jumped ahead ten days with a brief paragraph about what happened. With barely any dialogue, diary entries, or letters, this novel only described feelings and events. The ending came too fast and was too short, compared to the rest of the book and seemed very unrealistic to me. I was very disappointed - I do not recommend."
1,See the Movie,"Rarely does a movie shine when the book came first. Here is an exception. The prologue shows exceptional literary style and promise. The rest of the book (or as much as I suffered through) is so badly crafted that it is a wonder an editor let it through. If you are not interested in intricate details of Vietnamese generals, rapidly shifting points of view and uneven verb tenses, give this one a wide berth."
1,Low quality product,No where in the description is there anything saying that the inside is lined with plastic. I got an almost equally as good deal and the product didn't have a plastic interior. I don't want to have leached plastic chemicals in my hot beverages. This would be OK if it were for cold beverages but not for a mug.
1,Watchable-ish,"It had zombies.. That's a star!It had a heavily armed nut spouting bible verses while he mowed down some zombies... That's a star!Hence the two star rating. otherwise it had all the pitfalls ""B"" grade zombie movies have... lousy acting, poorly constucted plot line, characters doing incredibly stupid things... ect. But did I mention it had ZOMBIES! So go ahead and watch it, ya know you want to!"
1,wrong book,"Once again, the specific book I ordered was NOT sent. I ordered French Women Don't Get Fat, 2005, 2007, paperback, and I received French Women Don't Get Fat, 2005, hardback, which does not contain the ending recipes of 2005, 2007 or the final section, which I found very useful.I got this book out of the library and had read the first 3 chapters when I decided to own a copy so I could mark it up. I hate marking up hardbound copies.This book is wonderful for me as it implies an entire change of attitude with respect to eating. This won't happen in a day, one reading, but needs months so I plan to xerox the pages I want from the library and savor this book, but I do wish it were paperback."
1,Chick lit goes to Rome,"This is the first I've read of this author, who came recommended to me. Most likely the last. Written in the fluffiest ""hey sistah"" chick lit style I found it difficult to relate to and/or care about the heroine in the least little bit. I was expecting something along the lines of Anita Diamat'sThe Red Tent and boy was I disappointed. Many times a reader can overlook a contrived plot if the character or story is interesting enough, but not in this case. Don't waste your time or your money on this one."
1,Rip-off,"I am a great lover of the Aubrey/Maturin tales and yet this project simply smells to high heaven of a publisher trying to squeeze yet another dime out of the dead author's estate. As noted by other reviewers, a significant fraction of the ""book"" is quite simply illegible. The story line, surely to have been improved, is near-incomprehensible. I was more than satisfied to know that Jack had finally and at last been awarded his Admiral's flag at the end of the 20th installment of this wonderful multi-volume novel. In fact, at the time of O'Brian's death I noted to friends that the series could not have ended on of finer note. Now we have this. It offends the memory of O'Brian and all those who love his work. Note: my one star is simply to acknowledge an adequate afterword by Richard Snow; although I suppose if he'd been someone of real character he would not have associated himself with this project. A waste of money and time. We would be better off re-reading the first 20."
1,Stopped working,"I bought this charger because of the retractable cord and I thought it would be less bulky in my car. I used it periodically, maybe once or twice a week during my commute, and after 6 months, the device stopped charging. I thought it was my port but it was the charger as I bought a second charger from a local electronic store that worked but when I switched out chargers to this one, the phone would not charge. I have an iPhone now but this product cannot be recommended."
1,Horrible Reception,"This antenna has horrible reception! When using it the radio says ""loading"" for about a minute, then says ""no signal"". Occasionally a signal will pop in but a few minutes later it fades and I hear radio noise. I'm very dissappointed. 25 reviews on here gave it 4 to 5 stars so I bought it. It is smaller than the original factory version which may explain the lower quality reception. It's jack also doesn't fit the adapter 1x2 jack on my delphi unit. you'd think they could provide the proper jack or adapters. Very poor Belkin. I know its cheap, but if it doesn't work you've stolen our money AND wasted our time."
1,Disappointing,"I've seen about 5 Harry Carey B westerns from the 1930s and all were entertaining. ""Border Devils"" is unfortunately one of the worst B westerns I ever saw. The pacing is terrible and the supporting players (except George Hayes) are awful in their deliveries. Even Harry Carey (one of my favorites) delivers his lines unconvincingly. The script is muddled as well. The scenery is terrific and this would probably have been a good silent western, as you wouldn't actually hear the static delivery of the cast. The director must have been dozing. I've given my copy away. Luckily it has been my experience that, in buying dvds of movies I've not seen before, such disappointment is a rare occurence. I've given this film 2 stars for the scenery, a decent print, and George Hayes."
1,Horrible Piece of Fluff,"This book sucked. I'm sorry to say it so bluntly, but I had definitely expected more from Sidney Sheldon, and this was a barley laughable waste of time...there is NO character development, and the girls, as noted by an earlier reviewer, got out of EVERY situation in the most corny, unrealistic ways. What was even more irritating than that was Mr. Bad Guy Kingley's remark EVERY SINGLE time they did that..kinda like a newer version of ""Curses, foiled again!"" The girls would escape and he'd go ""Damn those bit**es!!"" Hahaha, okay, maybe that was laughable, but really, don't waste your money. This plot would have been better off sometime after midnight on any B Movie cable channel...I.E: Lifetime."
1,Not inspired from Best Practices,"Could be as an introudtion of a book on Leadership, because it just gives broad and theoretical ideas on Leadership."
1,Has the whole world gone crazy?,I put this album in and felt like there must be some kind of mistake. Is it possible that it was burned incorrectly? Was there some stripe of problem with my cd player? All of these explanations would be more reassuring than the truth - an album so terrible that there's just no excuse for it. I feel like someone played a prank on me. Be sure to listen to the samples before springing for this. Trust me.
1,Wrong trance CD ever,This is probably the worst trance CD I've ever heard.The only thing this CD has going for it is a strong continuous (if not mind numbingly boring) beat.
1,Good movie convered to poor quality,"This is the worst DVD I've seen. I've seen the movie before, and it was great. The quality of this DVD makes you not even want to finish the movie. The sound and picture quality is poor at best. I thought may be it was my copy, but apparently all copies from this company are like this."
1,did not fit,again the description was confusing but i needed the item so i took a chance and it was too big. but thanks to amazons great return system ups picked up my return with in 1 day. thank you amazon
1,Not so good,"I love licorice and have had the ""real"" stuff before. These drops are chewy and have this ammonia taste which I find most unpleasant. They also get stuck in the teeth and leave a nasty aftertaste.I suggest Young and Smylie drops from Hershey's. They are a great texture and taste. Won't stick to the teeth either! They are just a shade more expensive but well worth it."
1,Thoroughly disappointed in Leg Avenue,"Leg Avenue Women's Queen Sheer Garter Belt Panty Hose #1901QThis is the third item I've purchased made by Leg Avenue. Let's face it - if you want something you can wear for about five minutes before ripping it to shreds, go with Leg Avenue. They're so cheap and flimsy, it wouldn't even leave any marks.If you're looking for something that'll last at least one day, look elsewhere, as Leg Avenue simply won't.I opened the package to find these stockings open in the seam in two places! The quality control staff must have stayed home that day. Even so, I tried them on for a romp, and the seam split about two feet. That wasn't even where the seams were originally open, so the design of these products are severely flawed, as well.Top of my lingerie checklist from here on out: 1. Check to see if it's made by Leg Avenue. If it is, shop elsewhere."
1,Doesn't store ice,"I bought this because we do a lot of entertaining, and I thought it would be nice to have an ice maker instead of buying all the bags of ice. But it doesn't store the ice... the fine print in the instruction manual says ""it is NOT a refrigerator"". Too bad I didn't see that before buying. My friend has had a portable ice maker for years, but it also stores ice, so it is really convenient. Hers was on the high end, this is on the low end. Even if you empty it every 15 minutes and dump in a cooler, it starts to melt in the cooler before you can get it filled up. I'm selling this at the next garage sale and in the meantime, I'm getting a ""better"" one."
1,Shaver review,"The grouping of the three blades is to large. The blades need to be smaller in diameter to cover less area on the face. Also, the quality of construction using more plastic indicates that you are forcing your customers to purchase new shaving heads on an annual basis. The shavers you made twenty years ago were of better quality."
1,Poor representation,"This movie is inconsistent with any other history I have read or seen about Henry VIII and this period in England.The movie makes Mary out to be so innocent and timid when she is forced to go to the King's bed. Any others portray Mary as a wh*re in both the French Court and the English Court.The ""Movie Tie-In"" book by Gregory contains little to no similarities with the movie.The movie also makes very poor use of it's nearly 2 hours in providing any sort of in depth look into this period in Henry VIII's life."
1,Run Away!,"Breathtaking drivel. For the record, I found exactly one accurate depiction in the book. It's where the head of the NSA is trying to figure out what's going on and brightens up at the thought that someone is lying. Intelligence officers do enjoy a good plot. They won't find it here:1. Nobody in the military (or in any other walk of life, for that matter) speaks the way the characters in this book do.2. Nobody in the military acts the way this writer describes them.3. Neither do officials of the US government.4. Neither do men and women.5. It would take the media about a nanosecond to begin hypothesizing about the possibility of the ""accident"" to be the result of an attack. It would take the crowd of retired and former military know-it-alls just a moment longer to begin spilling classified information and spinning their own hypotheses."
1,Horrible,purchased 2 of these one came with a dry rotted sling band... was really disappointing... also this is more or less for kids the part that rests on the hand is pretty small .....
1,Very Strange,"I was ok with what the book had to offer in the beginning, however after a couple of chapters the book became very strange in the thoughts that were being conveyed. I finished the book and probably won't look at it again. Parts of the book were very disturbing and others were very interesting to say the least."
1,Product does not match description,The advertised description and my receipt clearly state that this is supposed to be a Pack of 6. There are two pair in the box. Next time I'll go to Penney's or Wal Mart and get what I pay for.
1,huge Disappointment,"I'm not one to whine about games crashing when using a 3rd party program, its part of the risk you take. I will complain about beyond worthless construction. I made the mistake of buying one of these, WITHIN THREE HOURS the unit was broken due to poor construction, instead of using nice silicon chips for your game, it uses bronze maybe brass pins, very tiny, very thin, VERY BRITTLE, guess what, once they bend, its worthless, i sent it back to madcatz, got a replacement and SECOND TIME inserting a game the pins bent again. I had more fun destroying the replacement with plyers than i did the 6 hours of programming all the codes i wanted on there. Anyone foolish enough to heed my warnings, enjoy your blunder."
1,Don't Get This Flavor,"I'm not picky about how my supplements taste, and I like most of the other Big 100 bars, but this one is awful. It tastes like several of the cheapest liquors you can buy mixed together, and almost burns your throat like it too for that matter. I wanted to throw it out every time I took a bite. Save your taste buds and your wallet, and pick another flavor."
1,Plastic Cracked,"I only had this brush for about a month until it fell off a shower shelf and the plastic cracked. At that point the brush split into two pieces. I snapped the pieces back together, but a few weeks later it fell off the shelf again causing a few entire chunks of plastic to splinter off one side of the brush. It wouldn't snap back together. I threw half of the brush away and still use the other half. Even before it broke I would have only given this brush 3 stars. The bristles are too soft to do any serious scrubbing. It's my least favorite finger nail brush that I have ever owned and the only one that has ever had the plastic crack."
1,I Didn't Like It.,"I thought it was poorly researched. I mean... people used SOS in sailing ships in the 19th century? WTF? SOS wasn't used until the 20th century! A race of silly bickering aliens manage to take down Sulu and the Excelsior? Double WTF! There are times I found the writing clumsy and amateurish. I don't know why the editor didn't do a better job checking this out.Star Trek is supposed to be exploring that's out there, not negotiating for hostages. It's such a waste of time. I can't believe this guy co-wrote one of my favorite Star Trek movies."
1,Crap,"Mexican guys talking about stuff. Should not have the word Pantera in it, for those that ventured that far into the Pantera search results listen to the samples! They are funny as!"
1,Lamb,This dude who claims to both respect Madonna and Mariah is a LAMB. Dont be fooled. And NO Mariah is not the best selling female of all time. Mariah and her propaganda crew inflates her numbers to no end! Celine Dion has sold more then Mariah for crying out loud! Madonna is in the Guiness Book of world records for being the best selling female. If Mariah was you would think they would have changed it. Madonna could have the best selling album to if she released 50 versions of the same album.
1,A Fool and His Play,"This play was HORRIBLE! It was very unrealistic, filled with hypocrisy, and it made the entire family look like naive idiots!"
1,Why waste time and money on books like these?,"Before you are going to spend any money to buy this book, think about this:""If he is so successful in trading futures, and became a master and making tonnes of money, why does he bother to write a book to teach other people his successful methods?""Is Warren Buffet (the second richest man in the world) writing a book to teach people how to invest in stocks and become as rich as he is?If you find out a way to make money in trading futures, would you have any spare time besides growing your portfolio to millions? Why would you even want to teach others to compete against you?"
1,Beg to Differ,"Future film director Bergman has an interesting idea here but completely fumbles it as New York dick Jack LeVine travels east to help an old friend and stumbles onto the beginnings of the Blacklist. Great idea, but LeVine's smug, ""believably hard-boiled"" narration is incredibly lame-o. The Hollywood characters are reasonably well-done, but LeVine is never believable, just ridiculous. Try to imagine ""The Sun Also Rises"" being narrated by a private eye. Then move on to some other book!"
1,Math Fun,This was just an ok Math Book the tricks are very basic. I would send back if I could but not worth the $
1,HELP...BUGS....BUGS....BUGS,"I loved this game until I entered the second level and there was a bug preventing me from jumping onto a rather close ledge, the game rocked until this point, if anyone knows the bug I am talking about in the second level and knows how to get passed this jump, please let me know, until then this game gets a 1 star because there is no zero, it would have been a perfect ten but the bug prevents me from progressing on my PS2HELP ME PLEASE!!"
1,Not Worth the Harassment,"I've had this magazine for the past year and have used several of the tips, activities, posters, etc. However, I have also gotten endless emails from Mailbox promoting products and asking me to renew way in advance. This continues though I asked them to stop. For the last three or four weeks, they've been calling me on the telephone every day. This continues though I asked them to stop. The few good ideas in each $6 issue are nowhere near worth the trouble of dealing with this harassment."
1,Couldn't pick up any reliable signal,"I live only a few miles from a repeater tower and this antenna couldn't pick up any local channel at all. The channels it did pick up were really low signal. The antenna that came with my other TV picks up all local channels just fine and in HD in perfect quality. Not sure why this antenna failed so badly, but just a fair warning to anyone out there thinking of it."
1,Sorry to disagree,"I really wanted to like this book. I am about the same age as the author, and I spent much of my 30s and 40s as a solo traveler. But I found this book full of cliches, self-justification, and name dropping. Sorry, folks...."
1,I was expecting much better from Ridley Scott,I gave it 2 stars for the special effects but the story was absolutely terrible. Not worth the time even if you are a big Alien fan.
1,good for a while,"Product arrived as advertised within allotted shipping time and appeared to be of good quality. After 4 months of use, the cable cuts in and out. I finally replaced it with a name brand cable."
1,bloody disaster,"heavy handed and dull, the women were not likeable and neither was the guy, cute intro scene with the fluffy pink pen...that's about it."
1,Noisy,"If you are using this in a bedroom, you might want to buy earplugs as well. On the high setting, this is as noisy as a medium sized fan on high."
1,Kindle version of this book is missing most of chapter 12,"Beware: kindle does not care enough about content to verify that the digital version of this book is complete. It is missing most of ch 12, where the novel's climax is reached. So you miss the resolution. Many scanning errors too, which make parts of it like deciphering code. Shame on amazon for profiting on this incompetence, and having no place to get recourse."
1,FYI:Piano Duet,"the name of the piano piece that ""Little Miss"" dueted with Andy is the Berceuse from Gabriel Faure's 'The Dolly Suite.' This piano duet was written for the child Dolly Bardac, whose mother later married Claude Debussy. Titles of other movements include lighthearted references to Dolly's cat (Mi-a-ou and Kitty-Valse)."
1,Pathetic.,"Implausible and pathetic. Forget about the plane crash or surviving in the wilderness, this movie is about a bunch of misfits being killed off one by one by a pack of wolves."
1,Fun Books-Lousy Theology,"This series of books should be read for fun and entertainment, not as a discourse in the theology of eschatology. I enjoyed reading the books myself, but would hesitate to recommend them to a new Christian or nonbeliever who might become confused."
1,Christmas Disappointment,"The Leapster System was the one gift my five year old was really looking forward to this Christmas. She was thrilled Christmas day when she opened it and saw what it was, only to be crushed when it wouldn't work straight out of the box. The unit would not power up, it was completely dead. Hopefully this is just an anomaly as most of the other reviews here have been positive.Amazon was quick to try and remedy the situation but currently do not have any more in stock so now I have to try and find it locally."
1,Did not work for me.,Simply this product did not work for me. I followed the directions as stated. I added more pills daily and drank water with lemon.This product was a waste of money.Congrats to the people it did work for.
1,Uninspired,"I already have plenty of Vangelis and Jarre music, and thought that this compilation / tribute might make an interesting addition to the collection. I should have saved my money -- the recordings all sound like somebody typed a brief description of the relevant Vangelis or Jarre selection into a sequencer and then went out for coffee while the synthesier cranked out the bits. Utterly uninspired performances of everything, completely lacking in the fire and verve that made the originalssome of the best electronic / new-age music."
1,Excellent Music,"This album is in line with all other Andre Crouch albums - a must have, music for all seasons, full of relevant message and a treasure.I wish they could re-release it again."
1,Bummer,"I bought this CD for one song and only one song; Spanish Eyes. That track was deliberately [messed] up by Capitol. It included two false recording starts and the ensuing dialogue between Mr. Martino and a recording technician. That rendered the CD useless for my purpose, dancing."
1,So disappointing,"I eagerly picked up the 6th (and I thought final?) book in the Outlander series only to be woefully disappointed. I just didn't get it. The storyline was disjointed and unbelievable. As others have mentioned, seriously, how much rape, murder, and sex can we have? How many times do Jaime and Claire have to come close to death? And having come to love Jaime and Claire, I got so tired of their constant trials and problems. Can we give them just a little break? Roger and Brianna could have been a great storyline, but the author never really gave them any flesh or bones. I could never understand why they stayed, or their motivations. The end was rushed and unsatisifing. I read through 6 books and felt lost and abandoned at the end. There was no real tie up, no sense of conclusion. I was left with more questions and an unsettled feeling. Such a disappointment. I don't see how anyone could give this book a decent review."
1,A flop from beginning to end,"In 60 years, this could be the worst movie ever made. There was nothing redeeming, whatsoever, about this movie. The story was confusing, uninteresting and sloppy, with no plot at all/ The acting was abysmal. I can't tell you about the very end because after, I don't know how long (seemed like days), all 4 of us finally walked out with about 3 minutes remaining."
1,Not good for me,"The plug that goes into the laptop was loose and would fall out easily. I put a piece of shrink tube on it to cure that. The power pack itself malfunctioned in a couple of weeks giving out irregular voltages. I stopped using it for fear it would cause irreparable damage to my laptop. The old adage applies, you get what you pay for, this was a cheap no brand replacement and was a waste of money. I ended up buying another replacement direct from Dell."
1,Leaky diapers are a waste of money,The diapers leak if the child sits on the wet diaper. Impossible to go through the night without having to get up at least once to change the diaper. Otherwise the child will be soaking wet in the morning.
1,Scary,"We received this crockpot as a wedding present. I have come home to scorched chicken breasts, burnt roast, and too many other horrible messes to name. Do not buy it. The lid does not lay nicely, let's moisture out, and rattles. Everything cooks the same whether on high or low. It gets so hot."
1,Boring...,This was a very boring CD. It was only two songs I really liked; sheryl crow's tomorrow never dies and k. d. lang's surrender. Don't buy it!
1,I Wouldn't Buy Another La Crosse Product,"The first one I received was stuck on EDT which would be nice if I were there rather than the west coast. I wrote to Amazon and they promptly replaced it. The replacement was stuck on CDT. Perhaps in two more replacements it would work for me, but I can't be bothered. I don't expect this from any watch"
1,Torture!,"In their horrific greed the sleezy hollywood producers remade an awesome, funny, charming movie into a totally tasteless, mindless, unbearable farce! It's rarely that I can't sit through the whole movie but this one was the case!"
1,STAY AWAY!!!,"I have Adobe Premiere 6.01 and while it has good intentions, it is the ""buggiest"" program I've ever used. If you take one step forward, Adobe will take you two steps back. Fix one problem, two more will pop up. Playback problems, exporting problems, editing problems....Adobe should have kept this one until all the bugs were worked out. If you need proof, visit Adobe.com and browse through the hundreds of fed up customers on their Forum page. Ulead Media Studio Pro is a lot less painful to use, and you get the same results."
1,0 stars....negative in fact,"bands as good(formerly) as metallica have no place releasing trash like this. i dont understand why a band with the money to produce a cd well would take music that could possibly be good and record it, fine tune everything, and then make it sound like (expletive deleted) on purpose to cash in on the trend of ""stripped raw!"" production employed by black metal bands(not for style, simply because of monetary reasons). black metal works with bad production value because of the atmosphere of the music, metallica is a ""thrash metal"" band, not black metal, and thrash with crusty production sounds like $hit. this cd is metallicas greatest catastrophe since burtons death. for the 'tallica boys, pretend you never released this and move on to the next master of puppets....or retire and quit while your behind"
1,This Product Sucks!,"This product is the absolute worst tinting film I have ever seen. I didn't even get the chance to see what the optical quality was because it doesn't stick to the window! I followed the directions with the extra application kit I bought and when you wet the surface, the film doesn't stick at all. Then I tried applying it without the wetting solution and the film wrinkled up so much it was impossible to flatten out. If I had the choice of picking no stars for this product, I would have. Do Not Buy This Product!"
1,The Traveler's Gift,Don't waste your money. A self help book with tips you see a million different places.
1,Rainbow 6 for Sega Dreamcast,"I went to blockbuster on my Birthday and I saw rainbow 6 for the sega dreamcast. I was like Whoa cool im definitly gonna rent this. When I got home and played it for 10 minutes I was mad. Rainbow 6 for dreamcast was an exact copy of the PC version. It had no enhanced graphics on it. The game is at max 64-bit graphics. Dont buy this game it was fun for the pc but not for dreamcast. To top it all of the controls sucked too. Dont buy this game, It's definitly not worth it."
1,"basic items,basic knowledge,procedures:lacking,tech needed","Mr. Rosenthal; doesn't tell reader about the extra procedures, computer items, & extra knowledge needed. I had to have technical help constantly. Told more about pentium. Didn't tell of others & their differences. No mentioin of certain other items needed, such as rear fans,etc. How cables were hooked together & you received extra cable. The I\O sheild had to be removed & inserted back 5 times. Line up of knock-outs with cards before this procedure of (using hand, better) takeing apart & get these items out. Save These. Other items & procedures along with no complete basics - hurts the first time PC builder."
1,Inferior product,The shoe I received must have been a second or a knockoff. Quality was not that of sperry. Very disappointing. Could not return it as my son left for college the next day and needed them.
1,"some good, some bad","The attachments are of great interest to my son, but this toy isn't a big help as far as mobility goes. When he was first starting to walk, he would hold on to the handle, and if he fell at all and didn't let go of the handle, the toy easily tipped on top of him. Now that he is older (18 months), he is bored with the stroller aspect of it. We never did find a time that it seemed appropriate for him. As a sit-on toy, it is REALLY hard for a toddler to move with their legs. The wheels do not roll too easily at all."
1,really awful,"I have been buying from Amazon for years, and this is the first review I'm posting, because I want to warn others that this DVD is absolutely terrible! It's cheezy beyond belief, and the woman who narrates is SO slow, and sounds like she could be reading from one of those booklets that comes inside a tarot pack. The ""sample spreads"" are ridiculous...they give nothing interesting, just the absloute most obvious and simplistic information. Please, spare yourself. I thought a DVD might be more ""entertaining"" than a book, but boy, was I wrong."
1,"Overpriced--That's the fax, ma'am....","The fax machine was reasonably priced & works well, but after buying 3 cartridges, I feel like I bought the fax all over again. In other words, the cartridges are overpriced and it's not even like the inkjet cartridges for which you can purchase ink refill kits. If you want to receive faxes, then you have to buy the expensive cartridges that I am sure didn't give me 100 sheets of print each. Amazon has the best price that I've found so far, but I still think the item is overpriced."
1,How Foolish,"I'am a born again Christian, and yes, I know for a fact that Jesus Christ existed and IS the Son of God, but aside from that, like another reviewer said, yeah, it is one thing to be skeptical if Jesus Christ is the Son of God who he claimed to be, but to completely deny Jesus's existence is just the stupidiest thing.For crying out loud, even atheists know that Jesus existed. They don't argue with that. They just blindly deny him as the messiah and Son of God and label him as just a man like one of us.If you wanna be a fool though like this guy who made this bogus documentary, go head, watch it. Waste your money and 2 hrs of life. GO HEAD!!!! But if you are smart, you'll pass."
1,Red Dragon VT 2-23 C Weed Propane Torch Kit,"It was studily built. Amazon was great in its speedy processing of my order. However I could not use it and had to return it. Its connector did not fit either the small camping propane canister, or the large barbecue propane tank. Amazon should clearly specify the connector of this product so that there would be no waste time and money from both the consumer and Amazon.I am still looking for a weed propane torch that will work for me."
1,Wrong Version,Received the item with great expectation to see Michael Caine in Cold War spy thriller.To my disapointment the Disc could not be read by the disc player.Probably a european version.
1,Look elsewhere!,"Conway's rock 'n' roll years are pretty much ignored compared to his country years (except of course for Bear Family's gargantuan box set) and of course there are those who would like to get in on the groundfloor and see what those years were really like.Direct Source attempts to do a decent set of Conway rock, but it sorely misses the mark. First thing to notice is the picture is not period on the front. Ok, we won't sqabble about that, but there are also a complete total lack of liner notes in this. So, we don't know when anything was recorded, etc.But, to add insult to injury, the sound quality is horrendous.Many cuts are in a very noisy monaural format. One cut seems to be a rerecord(Big Town) and I think one cut makes it in stereo.If you're extremely budget conscious and don't care about the flaws, pick up the thing. But, you'll find you like it and you'll be getting rid of this one!"
1,Lost in the Rabbit Hole,"Justly forgotten British musical based on the Lewis Carroll classic - redeemed only by Peter Sellers' inspired performance as the March Hare and the BAFTA-winning cinematography of Geoffrey Unsworth. Young children may enjoy ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland,"" but adults will be bored. A remastered widescreen version is available in the UK."
1,Lot's of fun but don't expect it to last long,"I bought this for my daughter. She loves to play with it. But we were disappointed by a couple of things. As we started to brush their hair- wads of hair came out. It tangles easily and is hard to manage but she still enjoys it. Also her other disappointment was the hair color. Although it comes in more than one color, you can't tell the difference between them in the hair. Really, it barely even shimmers."
1,Wrong title,"If you were a research student looking to gain some insight into Indian business culture then you would be as disappointed as I was after reading this book. The back cover of the book suggests ""Indian Business Culture addresses the cultural issues related to doing business in India"" but the reader is left wondering 'where'? From the tilte of the book you would expect discussion about cultural issues in Indian business however this is not the case. The book is obviously wrongly titled. Its deals with socio-political history of India. The author has carelessly title the book. It also contains some errors such as Nehru's death is claimed to have occured in 1962 whereas he actually died in 1964. There are occasional gramamtical and spelling errors too.This book isnt worth 19.00."
1,Disappointed,"Very disappointed in this unit purchased from Amazon, used once on my smoker for ribs, next in the oven for a prime rib roast. Oven temp set for 225 F. but the meat probe kept going off the scale with an HHH reading. Looks like the coating over the steel wire going into the probe burned off. Don't waste your money on this unit as it will not hold up."
1,waste of money,"I bought this toy for my 4 year old daughter and had to throw it away within hours. It kept falling apart, as soon as you got it together and tried to play with it, it fell apart again. My daughter was very dissapointed. Also there are tons of tiny pieces that are impossible to keep track of, and they don't fit anyway."
1,never got it,"I don't wan to give this any stars, they sent the wrong item ,got it 2 days before Christmas,called the company never got any call backs. Would tell everyone not to order fro them!"
1,I Wish I Was Dead,"I lost interest so early in the film. There was lots of jumping around, and back and forth in time which wasn't really hard to follow -- but it seemed excessive. The premise of the film seemed interesting, but the followthrough was so far off the mark -- like perhaps a high school kid wrote the script. Too many odd characters when they were not necessary. The redeeming 2 stars I gave this were for the ending. While there is one aspect of the film that just leaves you hanging... ""like, hey -- so what about him? what happens to him?"" There is one very suprising incident to close out the story that I did not see coming. I will try to steer clear of this write and directors films for some time..."
1,Give My Money Back,"Now that I've spent about $75 for the first three seasons, they want me to spend another $111 to see the rest of the series. I think not."
1,"Warning! This is not about Bunratty Castle, IE","This book has NOTHING to do with Ireland, or the real Bunratty Castle!!! This was very disappointing for my kids, who wanted to read a story after visiting there this summer."
1,cologne is different,"Be careful, this cologne is a different color and does not smell like the real bottle from the dept store is it the same? it said Eau De Toilette spray vaporizer on the bottle."
1,Ouch - I got brain cramps,"Wow.. where do I begin? The filming is high-school, first college project quality.... lots and lots of gaffes to pick out. The acting is about the same. There are some cute moments, but the overall effect felt like a Rocky Horror knock-off.... I am talking some serious camp here folks!!! The movie really has zero to do with bollywood.... anyway, nuff said. If you are gonna watch this film... my only advice is... take two tylenol first (tequila might work)! :)"
1,Excellent for the first 366 days,"I bought 3 pairs of these. The first pair broke in the first year. Philips replaced them. Then I went through the replacement set, and the remaining two sets. Each of the 4 pairs broke in exactly the same place: Where the metal loop meets the headband. The plastic just disintegrates and the headband metal straps poke out of the vinyl covering and into my head. Ouch.Purchased 12-10-07, last pair broke 11-30-11; so less than 1 year of use per pair on average.No travel, these just sat on my desk at work, or on my head."
1,A thriller is a mystery,"Amazon reviewer says Tell No One is the thriller tht will break Harlan Coben out of the mystery genre. This statement is wrong on so many counts that's it hard to count them (usually when a reviewer maks a comment like that I just stop reading the review, since it shows that the reviewer has no understanding of what he or she is writing about. Thrillers are mysteries and it's the mystery plot in Tell No One tht keeps the reader going. We want to find out who killed the Scope boy and why Dave's wife is in hiding. The problem with the book is that the first person narrator (noting that other parts are third person) keeps back one piece of information until the final pages, leaving the reader conned rather than surprised. Plus since Coben does this at the very end, you don't have time to say, ""Wait a minute, how did the killer manage to get away with it? That's how a five star book turns into a one star review. As for review, I'd give in minus 5 stars."
1,Disappointment,"Very disappointed with the this bench very shakey and to large for the tub not worth sending it back, I gave it away."
1,Another hard to read book by over used vocabulary Phds.,Why do historial or scientific writers feel they have to use the biggest words they can find in their books? I'm an educated man and I had to stop at least twice every page to look up words in the dictionary. I don't feel like doing this for the entire book.Most of the heavy words could have easily been substituted with single word replacements. I can use a thesaurus to find the biggest word to use too... I just choice not to in my writtings so readers can enjoy and understand rather than trying to show them how educated and well versed I am.My overall review is that this book would have been much more enjoyable if egos didn't get in the way of the topic being illustrated.
1,Good Grief!,"I love reading Peggy Noonan's WSJ column; so let's get that out of the way right now. Peggy generally writes in a stream-of-consciousness form that I like. It captures my attention from the first sentence and holds me to the end. But not this book. After a page or two I noticed I was skipping ahead, looking for the bait and the hook. It's not there. That's Writing 101. She knows that! What I suspect is this: Her publisher contracted with her for a give-back linked to something else, and she wasnt interested in the project. It shows!"
1,"Please don't buy this item, it is not the same as the picture","I've received this item and I was shocked that it is not the same as the picture , the belt has the same model number as described but the buckle and the leather keeper loop are different."
1,Poor little Andy,"This is the most hilariously overrated film I've seen in recent memory. It made me laugh harder than Superbad. And the piles of lavishing praise shown in these reviews take me to an extremely cynical place with the epiphany that Art is truly a minor part of peoples' lives. Even professional film critics (paired with the ""user comments"" of gullible civilians like/unlike yours truly) reserve a small window for the seeming ""fine"" arts, and whatever cow patty splats at their feet conveniently gets awarded the quota.To be ironic and yet truthful, I highly recommend this film for some of the funniest moments in cinematic history. You will be cheering for Andy's little nature puzzles to collapse by the first quarter-hour, and when they do, it's devilish fun."
1,Disappointed,Maybe I missed the point of the book. I found it boring and gave up on it half way through. Enough said.
1,Unnecessarily Violent; Tired Hollywood Agenda,We were anxiously awaiting this movie and took our 3 young children to the theater when it opened. As big fans of the first Cars movie; we couldn't have been more disappointed in the sequel. This movie is unnecessarily violent and pushes the tired Hollywood theme of the evil oil company. I really wanted to walk out of the theater. Don't waste your time with this trash.
1,Save your money,"Total ripoff. Less than an hour including extras, more shots of crowd members than players, and the boring voice-over frequently reminding us that this is the only tennis tournament that really matters doesn't help a whit. A truly pointless dvd with very little tennis. Summing up hundreds of matches in about 30 minutes of footage? You do the math.Might be worth buying only if you were there and hope to see yourself in the many audience shots. Otherwise, with barely any tennis on the disc, what's the point? Pure fluff.Go instead to the infinitely better Classic Matches at Wimbledon series; the Borg/Mac 1980 dvd has more quality in five minutes than this does in 55, and costs half as much.Passola."
1,"The book was all right, but it was not in ""good"" condition--too stained.","As I said above, the book was all right, but it was not in ""good"" condition, as described. It was quite stained (I guess) by light exposure."
1,appeals to the basest in man,"There is an urge in most of us to find the ""clay feet"" of great people. We cannot stand greatness, especially moral greatness, in others. Why? Because it is a reproach to us. It reminds us of what we are not. Let us just step back and ask ourselves: has Hitchens ever worked among the poor, let alone dedicated his whole life to them? No. He sits in comfort, aiding neither the poor, nor really anyone else. Has he invented anything? Come up with a useful theory? Brightened anyone's life in any way? Has he even uncovered truth as a journalist? No. He is just an angry opinion monger. When he has made even a single life happier, then he will have earned the moral right to judge Mother Teresa."
1,BEWARE OF WHAT YOU BUY,"WARNING............WARNING.....WARNING........................I bought a weather station here, and it worked fine for 6 months,, then only the inside temperature and clock worked, all other features were gone.I called Oregon Scientific, and they said.....sorry THE service they were using to sync with the weather station i bought went out of business, and now i have only a $100 clock.So any weather stations they sell now DO NOT HAVE THE FULL FUNCTIONS, and since mine is 6 months old......sorry they have anything to replace it with, and won't take it back for another model.IN OTHER BEWARE OF WHAT YOU BUY THAT IS BRANDED ""Oregon Scientific""...YOU MAY BE PAYING A LOT OF MONEY FOR A ""CLOCK"" AND NO WEATHER.I guess i am fortunate that i bought it on Amazon, since they are looking into a refund after verfying the info from........ OREGON UN-SCIENTIFIC"
1,"Oh, please!","I find it incredible that anyone could take this badly directed, badly scripted piece of historical revision seriously. Even if you ignore the homophobic, paranoiac re-writing of facts, the film seems to be the work of an over enthusiastic college student. No, make that junior high school. Agonizingly bad writing, self-indulgent acting . . . Oliver Stone used to be a decent film maker, but I wish he would just get his frustrations out on an analyst's couch and leave the rest of us in peace."
1,this album is crap,...This group takes what could have been a an amazing premise and turns into into pure wussy drivel.I through this cd out my window on the freeway.
1,Not worth the money,"It's loud. No timer. The toaster barely toasts, I have to toast twice to get ""toast"". Definitely not worth the money."
1,Horrible!,"I use much cheaper hair removal creams with better results. When I got my two bottles, I was excited but that was short lived. They had some grainy stuff in there and I'm still not sure if it was just expired or hardening. It barely took out any hair and I had to use shaving sticks (which I was trying to avoid) to remove the hair. I continued to use it anyway and used the whole two tubes with no success. I left it on longer the second time and it worked a little bit but I still needed a second method. I tried it on my hands, on my feet and on my underarm and it just did not work. It is a complete waste of money! Use Veet or Nair instead."
1,For beginners only,"I was very disappointed with this book. Too generic and high level to a reader to get much out of it. It should be considered for net mgt beginners only. There are other, better beginner books on the market."
1,3 strikes,Perhaps I misread the advertisements but it does not shut off when empty. A big negative in my book. Also the water container doesn't stand up when being filled - so it takes 2 hands - one for support and the other to put the top back on (which seems to leak if I'm not very careful about replacing it). An older Honeywell 500 series model has none of these problem. It isn't particularly quiet in my opinion. So while I'd probably buy another Honeywell I would not buy this one.
1,Poor Quality,Not nearly as substantial as pictured. Check out the collars at Allegro Medical Supplies website instead.
1,Horrible.,"The first couple of pages were sort of interesting. But after that? Crap.The characters are boring, one-dimensional cliches. The plot isn't really there - just a bunch of stories that keep repeating themselves, and they weren't even interesting to begin with. The art, as good as it might be on the cover, looks like a middle schooler's notebook scribbles on most of the pages, although there are a few pages where the art is detailed and decent looking. The only thing I liked about this manga was Edaniel, an amusing little cat who appeared on the last few pages, but he definitely wasn't worth it. The first and last time I'm going to give American manga a chance. A waste of money. Avoid at all costs."
1,Don't buy this product,"As someone who has set up many networks, this product is extremely awkward to set up, slows your speed by more than half and requires you to remove your security settings to set it up. After repeated attempts and complete frustration with the number of steps needed for setup, I put mine to work as a paperweight. If you want one of these, you can have mine."
1,Lotsa Filler & Fluff,"This book has a lot of information, unfortunatly 90% of it is made up of useless stories and worthless ""common-sense"" tips. The other 10% was in fact helpful, it's just too bad I had to weed the information out of the 500+ pages when it could have been written in 50."
1,stopped working after three months,"really space-saving, quiet, loved it until it just stopped working after only three months."
1,Poor Quality construction despite nice design,"I purchased 2 of these tables recently and they both had serious defects. Scratches, rough spots, inconsistent finish between top and sides, much lighter finish on sides than top, spots where staining was skipped, some wooden parts split in drawer when fasteners are tightened, etc.I asked for replacements and they arrived with worse flaws so I combined parts to get 2 barely acceptable tables to use in dimly lit room. I returned the other two. Previous reviews were good so I think the manufacturer sent AMAZON a bad batch recently made with very poor craftsmanship. They are not worth the problems at any price now since they are all defective."
1,Only works on High Setting,"I've tested this twice and it only works on the high setting. Not great for slow cooking! I wasn't sure at first because I always start it on high and then go to low, but it definetly doesn't work on low. I bought it this summer and didn't use it at first, so now it is too late to return it. Make sure you use it right away a few times, so you can return yours if it is junk."
1,It [is not good]!,"This is the worst USB Hub i've ever had the displeasure of working with. Several times a day it loses power and all devices connected to it stop working for upto 1 minute until it starts working again. I can't afford for this to happen as often as it is. I've never had a hub do this before nor have I heard of any hub having this problem. I would recommend LINKSYS and nothing else! Remember the saying....""You get what you pay for""!"
1,Very disappointed !!!,"I wasted a lot of time and money on this useless program. If you'll notice, most of the positive reviews were BEFORE they actually tried the program. So, those were ratings of how excited they were about the program as opposed to how well the program actually works. Save your money - this is no miracle cure."
1,Disappointed,"I am pretty healthy and wanted to do a cleanse. I was dissappointed that this product did not do that for me. I found that I actually felt constipated at times, and no different than if I hadn't taken this product. I would not recommend this or buy it again in the future."
1,Awful,"Normally I read a book of this type in a day or two. This one took over two weeks because I couldn't get past reading a chapter or two at a time before I had to put it down.Carolyn Blue may be the most stupid, irritating character to hit the cozy scene in a long time. She's pushy, nosy, condescending and flat out stupid. The whole book consisted of her eating and running around talking to people. The plot and the story never moved forward -- she just happened to show up at the murderer's place one time when he decided to let her in and confess.Cross this author off your list, and save your money."
1,Ultimate trash,Green Day are amongst the worst bands along with Foreigner.Billie Joe Armstrong is amongst the worst singers and this music is only meant for BABIES.The music is plain bad and sucks.AVOID THIS LOUSY BAND.GREEN DAY SUCK!GREEN DAY SUCK!GREEN DAY SUCK!GREEN SUCK!GREEN DAY SUCK!GREEN DAY SUCK!GREEN DAY SUCK!GREEN DAY SUCK!GREEN DAY SUCK!GREEN DAY SUCK!GREEN DAY SUCK.AVOID ALL ALBUMS FROM GREEN DAY.Get BACK IN BLACK from AC/DC instead.
1,defective,The spring on the one I received was defective and I had to return the item. The inside piece just kept sticking.
1,"""Hula"" is Downright Unreadable","Maddy Hunter is a writer with much potential - which is rapidly being wasted. Her first two ""Passport to Peril"" mysteries, ""Alpine for You"" and ""Top O' the Mournin'"" were good, especially ""Top O' the Mournin'"". The third book, ""Pasta Imperfect"" was mediocre at best - very juvenile. But ""Hula Done It"" is downright unreadable. It is not only filled with enough ""brand product references"" to be an infomercial, it is boring and strained. Like something the advertising department at the publishing house cranked out according to a tired formula."
1,BETTER AS A POOL THAN A SANDBOX!!!!,"I AGREE W/ THE OTHER REVIEWS.....EVEN THOUGH IT MIGHT MAKE A NICE ADDITION TO YOUR YARD...I SPENT MORE TIME TELLING MY SON TO STAY AWAY FROM IT THEN TO PLAY IN IT!!!! IT FILLED UP W/ TONS OF RAIN WATER, GRASS CLIPPINGS AND MADE A NICE SPOT FOR INSECTS TO HANG OUT IN. THE LID DIDN'T WORK RIGHT FROM THE GET-GO. I ENDED UP GETTING RID OF ALL THE SAND AND FILLED IT UP AS A LITTLE POOL WITH WATER ON REALLY HOT DAYS!!!"
1,Too hard to put on!!,"Unless you're extra small, DO NOT BUY! It takes 5 minutes to put the thing on because it is too tight."
1,DONT EVEN THINK ABOUT TAKING THIS TRIP,"I RENTED WONDER BOYS AS PART OF OUR FRIDAY NIGHT AT THE MOVIES WITH SOME ANTICIPATION AS I HAD HEARD THAT IT WAS AMUSING AND FEATURED A TOUR DE FORCE PERFORMANCE BY MICHAEL DOUGLAS.NEITHER ASSUMPTION PROVED TO BE TRUE. I THINK THAT A MOVIE MUST HAVE SOME CHARACTER THAT THE AUDIENCE CARES ABOUT AND OR IDENTIFIES WITH.THIS MOVIE HAD NEITHER.THE SITUATIONS WERE INPROBABLE,RIDICULOUS ,AND JUST PLAIN NOT FUNNY.DOUGLAS'S PERFORMANCE WAS ONE DIMENSIONAL AT BEST,AND HIS RADICAL CHANGE AT THE END DEFIED CREDULITY.THE SAME CAN BE SAID FOR THE OTHER PERFORMERS.ESPECIALLY DISAPPOINTING WAS TOBEY MCGUIRE WHO AT BEST COULD BE DESCRIBED AS COMATOSE.WHAT WERE THEY THINKING ?19 MILLION IS TOO MUCH FOR THIS MOVIE .IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN TOTALLY IGNORED.AS MY WIFE SAID""IT IS THE WORST MOVIE I EVER WATCHED TO THE END"".SPARE YOURSELF DON'T WATCH."
1,Great While It Lasted...,"I was very pleased with this flash for the year or so i had it, but now the bulb seems to have died & Canon offers ZERO remedy for the problem. No repair, no replacement: ""So sad, too bad.""As a faithful Canon user for decades (my first Canon camera had a BRASS body!) this is extremely disappointing. Another wonderful symptom of our disposable society.I've yet to seek a remedy from Amazon, but am not optimistic..."
1,Vastly inferior to the Creative Zen Nano,"At the same $99 price point, the Creative Zen Nano has twice as much storage; a display screen; the ability to record via built-in microphone; the ability to play protected WMA files without converting to Apple's crappy AAC format, the ability to load MP3s directly into the machine without having to install Itunes, and the ability to tune in to FM broadcasts. Buy that product instead! The only reason to buy the iPod is if you want to be trendy and look cool by having the apple ""name brand"" item instead of a competitor. (And if you're that hard up to look cool, my sympathies.)"
1,Replacement Watch Bands,"I had my Nike Triax Speed 50 Super Watch # WR0083-002 watch for less than 1 year. The watch band broke where it attaches to the watch frame. I love the watch and it's been working great, however I can not find a replacement band. Not a good product if Nike is not going to provide support for the consumer."
1,Cardboard characters going through the motions,"This sterile narrative is about what people do, not what they feel. There is no depth, no emotion, no human response. It is fantasy, but fantasy fit for the lower half of the bell curve.The writer never bothers to enter the minds of the characters. He merely narrates action safely from afar, much as the director of a claymation film supervises his blobs of clay. One move follows another as his mannequins engage in sexual calisthenics, but never for a moment do we believe his characters are human.One reviewer suggests this is male erotica. Not so. It is non-erotica.Should one seek truly erotic writing, one might do worse than to try Anais Nin'sDelta of Venus."
1,Description does not fit the product.,The product description is totally wrong. The unit continually goes off as long as someone is in it's area. It doesn't have an alarm setting. I think the description is for another product other than this one. Very misleading. It only has a basic chime and even the battery requirements are wrong.
1,I read it to my Bama friend,". . . cause obviously, he couldn't read it himself. After explaining the jokes to him, he still didn't get them. This book is almost as big of a joke as Cliff Ellis: The Winning Edge.Those that enjoy this book will probably enjoy: Mulletheads: The Legends, Lore, Magic, and Mania Surrounding the Humble but Celebrated Mullet."
1,Shame on Criterion!,"Did this really need to be added to the Criterion Collection? I suppose this movie might be passable entertainment if you enjoy mindless CG effects, cardboard-cutout characters and classic rock anthems blasting over the dialog (though on second thought that might be a mixed blessing). With all the flag-waving and slow-motion Middle-America ""slice-of-life"" scenes, I thought I was watching a 2.5-hour Ford commercial! Trust me... if you like that sort of thing don't drop cash on this release... just tape a few hours of TV and skip over the programs in between."
1,I'm still waitting for the cd ...................,"I haven't rececived the cd yet. I sent a message to the seller, and I haven't got response either !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11"
1,Terrible.....,"At the end of the book, the other animals going to get eaten by the aligators is seen as a joke. Disgusting."
1,Not puchased.,This item was sent to me in error and was returned. I cancelled the order because the shipping was too expensive for such a small item. Purchase price was fully refunded.
1,won't hold the time in Hawaii,what am I doing wrong? I have reset the time several times and it still advances two hours.
1,The first poor Honor Harrington book,"This is the latest book in Weber's previously superb Honor Harrington series, detailing her military career. It picks up four years after the previous book. I thoroughly enjoyed every previous book in this series and would rate all of them four or five stars.This book is much more slow paced, predictable, and frustrating than the rest of the ones in the series. Having read the previous books, I could predict most of the ending of the story just by reading the back cover. I was especially disappointed that Weber relies upon the rather weak plot point that one diplomat in a key position obfuscates information to start a war. I would hope that the chain of communication in any government is not that vulnerable to subversion.My advice is to skip it. I won't be reading any more Harrington stories unless the reviews are positively glowing."
1,Promising Book Breaks Promise,"This book starts out just fine. Spencer lines you up with XML in an easily understandable manner. Unfortunately, he then kills it all by taking you on a trip that can only be used by IE5 browsers. In the real world, one has to allow that right now very few people use IE5 and most web sites are not going to want to forego all visitors who don't use it. His sample implementation even tells the visitor that if he doesn't have IE5 he needs to go get it then come back. This won't cut it! The author doesn't seem to understand that a general or business site needs to allow for nearly the lowest end browser so as to not exclude potential customers. If this were a more browser friendly book, it would be excellent."
1,did not care for it,This music is not medeival in nature. I found it to contain offessive langauge and was not true medeival. This group needs to have a warning lable on their music. Any true lover of medeival music would agree with me. I can discribe their music in one word YUCK!
1,Overcouming Obstacles,"Don't WASTE your Money on this!!!! She tries to hypno you way way tooo fast. From the start of the CD to the time that she tries to put you under is less then two minutes. The day that I got the CD I had been up for almost 16 hours and only gotten 3 hours of sleep the night before. Even being that tired, I was not able to get hypno in less then two minutes. I even listen to the CD three more times that night and still could not go under.The other thing is she does not have a calm and soothing voice. It is ruff and crackly.Denmeister"
1,"Nice, but....",As long as you have a way to convert the external style USB connections to match the typical internal style USB ports on your motherboard the product is just fine.It seems odd to me that an internal device doesn't even come with an option for the typical internal connections.
1,Jonestown meets Jainism,"Filmed at the height of the free love era, this film does not give any authenticity to Jainism, which is unfortunate. It makes it look like a joke and a cult like Jonestown. Jainism is a 3000 yr old religion that practices ahimsa, non-violence. I don't practice Ahimsa so I wanted to smack these people."
1,Agreed! Chuckles galore!,"As a matter of fact, maybe that should be the author's pseudonym: Chuckles Galore. It would make a great fake name.In any event, THE POSSIBLE WOMAN (or should I say THE PROBABLE CHICK?) reads like something penned on a few Friday nights while tossing back a few stiff ones. I certainly don't know the author (as some of the other reviewers have had the good fortune), but, suffice it to say, Marj sounds like she might be good for a few laughs.If there were any new ideas in here, I missed them as I was constantly distracted by what I'd call a 60's mentality of free love. While I'm not sure how you can mesh that world with today's feminist-driven whirlwind, the author fails miserably.Better to stay in the kitchen with pride than to enter the workplace ready to do things morally questionable, in my humble opinion."
1,NOT Received This Item,"Up to today's date 04/11/2006, I still have not received this item even though my credit card was charged and the item was ordered three months ago"
1,The Great War: not a great DVD,"I was very disappointed with this series. There maybe heaps of footage, but we see it all again and again and again throughout. The images are often inappropriate to the action being described, and the sound mixing of audio commentary and background battlefield noise is often completely out of balance, making the commentary inaudible. Some interesting scenes, but the constant repetition diminishes their impact. I almost sent my boxed set back, I think you could do much better elsewhere. I should have trusted the other reviewers, can't say I wasn't warned! You have been too."
1,Delicate hardware,The quick release clips on these seats are too vulnerable to fracture so be very careful when cleaning them. Also the hinge covers are manufactured by weakening the plastic to create the hinge action. This means they also are very delicate.
1,Very technical,"If you love sci-fi and love in depth, long explanations that detail just how everything in the author's world works, I would recommend this book. If you are more of a phillip k dick sci-fi fan like i am, I would not recommend this book. The story dragged on too long for me to add more stars."
1,Terrible!,I HATE THIS BOOK. It's hard to read...no pictures... everything is WAY TOO WORDY. You can't enjoy what you are studying because the book is soooooo dull. It's just a bunch of bla bla bla...Each chapter intimidates you because it is so long and drawn out. There's no set vocabulary or anything. It's hard to outline and get the whole pictures when the book absolutely sucks.
1,unbelievable,"This is a serious movie that gave me a lot of laughs, while watching I had to wonder a few times if it was a spoof. Wow. Bad, bad, bad."
1,Poor CD Quality,"I ordered the Edgar Winter CD ""Roadwork"". The product arrived slightly later than expected (no big deal), but the CD doesn't play properly on any of my players. It skips on almost every song. There is no visible damage to the disc, so I suspect it is an inherent defect. Fortunately, I was able to rip CD, so I do have a copy."
1,Most tracks seem unfinished,"Tony Levin is clearly a talented bass guitarist with the soul of a true progressive rock artist. This album, while conveying this talent and soul, unfortunately falls short in terms of giving the listener a full fledged, finished product with most of the tunes. It's like a handful of rough studio mixes and jam session recordings were suddenly deemed good enough to release. Every track shows promise but many could use editing and tweaking of some sort. This CD goes in my car for background driving music as a rhythmically interesting album, but it's not for living room, bedroom, or party listening."
1,Stud gun,"Not to happy cheap product , not all I thought it was gonna be . Would never of spent the money if I were to have seen it in a store ."
1,Our last Epson printer,"Pros:Good hardware, decent print quality.Cons:Not at all Mac friendlySlow as molassesRuns out of ink quickly, cartridges are expensiveThe worse feature is it won't let you print if any of the ""convenient individual"" cartridges are out. That means if you're printing b/w and yellow is out, it won't print.To add insult to injury, if you shake the ""empty"" cartridges you can easily hear ink in them."
1,WOW! what am I missing? How does this average 4 stars,"I am not sure what I am missing. I force myself to finish every book I start, but this one truly tested my resolve. I am not sure what the purpose, story or direction this book was trying to take. I never developed even a wit of interest in any of the characters or the story itself. It seemed to me as if the author simply sat down and chronicled the day to day activities of two very different, but not very interesting characters who lived different but not very intersting lives. All adding up to a different but decidedly bad book."
1,Put it down after the first couple pages of whining,"I bought this book b/c it made the NYT Book Review list of top novels, but the author began the novel whining - that's the only way to describe it, whining - that slick willie was treated oh so unfairly by we churchgoing middle-America do-gooders (I am a Southern moderate atheist who despises the Clintons for what they are - common trash) But it isn't the politics, per se, that that turned me away from the novel, I just find it hard to believe that such temporal political commentary can be a prelude to a work of any depth, or even a mark of a serious novelist, for that matter. And so I don't want to waste my time with it. If he wants to sermonize he should get the NYT or someone else to publish a column and not insult me by injecting his whining into what can only dubiously be termed 'a novel'."
1,Please remove my review -- see below for explanation,"Upon checking for my review just now, I realized that I erroneously reviewed this second edition. I assumed that I was writing about the first edition only. I have NOT READ the second edition. So please remove my review from the panel of reviews for this second edition. I could not leave the rating item blank, so the rating of 1--has no relevance. I apologize for the inconvenience."
1,LOL... What a disapointment!,I ordered three of these for my cats. I got them and guess what?? Not one of them stayed together. I had to silicon them together. I would have returned them with a nice note but it really isn't worth the trouble and time. I think they are probally banking that most people would feel that way. DO NOT BUY THIS! Spend alittle more money and get a better one. Thanks for listening.
1,Opening scenes have been deleted from the dvd!,"The opening scenes from almost all of the episodes have been omitted. These are the scenes that are crutial to the telling of each story. I do not, at this time, know if all sets are involved, or, if it is a quality control problem that occured when the episodes were transferred from tape to disk. Persons viewing these for the first time are going to be very confused and wonder why the series recieved such good reviews. Is my set a fluke or are all the new dvd sets flawed? Dissapointed in Nashville..."
1,I pray that the Lord has mercy on all your souls!!,I pray that the Lord has mercy on all your souls!!whether you believe in him or not you will have to face him on judgement day and you will see if you're going to heaven or hell. I rather be shour I'm going to heaven.Revelation 16:1111 And they said evil things against the God of heaven because of their pain and their wounds; and they were not turned from their evil works.Exodus 20:77 You are not to make use of the name of the Lord your God for an evil purpose; whoever takes the Lord's name on his lips for an evil purpose will be judged a sinner by the Lord
1,Great knife if you want a dull one,"I had high hopes when I bought it. After cutting two onions and a slice of stake, the knife is dull. I am shopping for another one now. It looks like the knife has built in child saftey features."
1,"Thanks, but no thanks","I received this cookbook as a gift and I just finished looking through it (I'll be trading it at the used bookstore). There isn't one recipe I'm interested in making. Many of the recipes call for ingredients like butter spray, butter buds, and fat-free cream cheese, sour cream, and grated cheese. Also, there's lots of Jello, Cool Whip and canned pie filling. I'm not a big fan of fat-free because it rarely tastes good; I'd rather use low-fat and eat less. Even substituting low-fat dairy for fat-free doesn't make these recipes sound better. If you usually cook using these types of ingredients, this book could be for you - it's just not my style. Sorry Dawn, you seem like a nice lady! Take a look at the cookbook 'Desperation Dinners' if you want quick, healthy AND TASTY recipes. It's one of my favorites."
1,NOT WORTH MONEY,"THIS TOASTER IS JUNK , BURNS THE TOAST EVEN ON THE FIRST SETTING I WOULDNT USE IT TO KILL MY SELF IN THE TUB. IT WAS A DISSAPOINTMENT SUCH A LOSS OF MONEY . THE BREAD SLICES SLIDE TO THE BOTTOM. JUST SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY YOUR SELF A BETTER TOASTER. I WANT MY MONEY BACK YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR ."
1,Such a shame...,"I had such high hopes for this machine. I have had my eye on one since they came out, but I've now gone through two of them and both were defective. It sure is small and easy to use when it works, but my first one had a propensity to shut off with no warning, and my second one blasts me with static every once in a while and the red light won't stop blinking when it should be green. I thought maybe my Windows Media files were corrupted, but they play just fine on my computer. I'm returning this thing and getting a different product."
1,It broke....,"seemed fine. but stopped working w/n a month. surprising, because i have another one that has been great. will cost a bit to retrieve data off this external hard drive"
1,Fell Apart,"These were used for casual everyday dress, not work and it took all of 2 weeks for the sole to separate from the boot. Crap!"
1,Professional CSS for web design,"I bought the book second hand in very good condition and after reading some of it, I know why it was in such good condition. I got very little out of it. The flow was very hard to follow and the examples seemed disjointed from the text. I would not recommend this book at all.,"
1,Very decieving,"Nothing like i expected. Very poor pictues of the sea, like pictures someone would take on vacation, but they weren't the good ones. Very dissapointed."
1,weak!,Boring! I just thought it would be more funny and interesting to look at. Fine black beautiful people is all I see but poor áctors! Very low budget!
1,Terrible video quality.,I love the show. I hate the video quality of this DVD. It looks like it was mastered with a VHS tape or maybe worse. Terrible video quality. Highly disappointing. At least I got it cheap.
1,RIP OFF ALERT!!,Whatever you DON'T BUY THIS ITEM! Nothing about it is enhanced. The picture quality is horrible and the packaging sucks! This is a rip off. If you want this movie on dvd buy the one released by Warner Bros. This dvd is horrible. The label is uneven because someone printed it from a printer and dvd is home made. The whole thing is homemade. I was very disappointed.
1,awful,"This movie was full of obscenities, smoking, during the first 10-12 minutes; I turned it off and threw it in the garbage. I would not say that this is a ""Christian"" movie, as advertised. It is about a Christian man--but too much of Hollywood for me.If you want Christian movies--The Kendrix brothers productions: Flywheel, Facing the Giants, Fireproof, Courageous etc. are excellent."
1,"If ""0"" stars was an option...I would have picked that!!!!","This was a pointless, never-ending book. How on earth did it become a Hallmark Movie?? Nothing wothwhile happens!! I know Grisham is a talented writer..but this was a flop."
1,Buy it and your on you own!,I purchased this bed about 6 months ago and have used it a couple of times. The last time I used the matress it started poping from with in. After you hear a pop you see a big knot appear in the middle of the bed. Now I have several big bumps in the middle of the bed which is no longer usable! I tried to return it but there is only 90 day return policy. I called the company and they told me they can do nothing for me. The is no warranty on this product. I feel used after paying $135.00 for about 7 uses of this bed! I guess I could look at the bright side my company had a place to stay when they visited. Next time I will be aware to look for warranty. Buyer beware : (
1,"""Bedtime Story"" from Movie Mars Inc via Amazon","I ordered the movie Bedtime Story from Movie Mars Inc and they sent me a PAL version which I am unable to watch on my DVD players. Very frustrating. Unable to contact anyone at Movie Mars other than by email. I could download a return form, fill it out, and take it to a post office to return it, but don't consider it worth the hassle. As for the movie, it was the original Dirty Rotten Scoundrels with David Niven and Marlin Brando. A great movie which no one seems to know about. I would still like an NTSC version, but don't trust them now."
1,DISAPPOINTING,"I know I'm in a minority, but though I'm a big fan of Krall, Wilson and Erskine , I found this release disappointing and inferior to the sublime Paris concert. Not because of the material--which is ok- but because of the production and performance. The former is spoilt by silly camera hyperactivity and a less than great sound quality.Regarding the performance, Krall seems to go for technique too often rather than content--and her vocals are sometimes tired sounding with intonation lapses.Wilson has his moments,but I prefer the sound of the older instrument he used in Paris.Hurst has plenty of chops but seems bored for some of the time and frankly the Hurst/Erskine axis doesn't swing as much as the Clayton/Hamilton pairing. (Compare their respective versions of All or Nothing and East of the Sun) Notwithstanding the above, I'll still eagerly await DKs next project..."
1,"Painful to watch, psychologically inaccurate","I had high hopes for this movie since it starred several excellent actors. My husband and I had a difficult time sitting though this silly movie without walking out. As it was, we stayed through the credits hoping to catch the name of the psychiatric consultant so we could send a poison pen letter. Wisely, no psychiatrist allowed his or her name to be associated with that movie.I did not find the end of the movie surprising, because it was similar to some of the ""multiple personality"" themes that were once popular in daytime soap operas. I suspect that modern soap opera audiences are now sufficiently sophisticated to see through that old theme.Many small and large details were laughably and gratuitously wrong.The actors performed well but the stupidity of the plot kept me from enjoying this."
1,"Good Idea, bad Follow-through.","This cable is a great idea, but there is no games to use it on. And it cannot be used as a 2nd controller to view your play-book(Madden 2002) or various things like that, many people were hoping for these things and I with others were disapointed with this product. Only buy it if you care obssed with raising Choas."
1,Dud received without legs,How do I use this product without legs. I am confused as to how they were even able to ship this thing without even knowing that they weren't in the box. I am really disappointed in this product and the manufacturer. Talk about checking your products before they go out the door. This company obviously did not check. What a bummer.
1,Unneccessarily complicated and no answers supplied,"To me, this seems the classical case of writers reasoning 'It was hard for us to learn, and therefore, we make it hard for you as well'. This book is terrible. It made my blood boil. There are many instances in this book where I dear to swear they made it complicated on purpose. Naturally: no answers supplied, and the 'answer book' is not in normal circulation"
1,Keeping Christ in Christmas,"It shocked me to discover many of the facts and phrases in this book lifted verbatim or altered only slightly from The Everything Christmas Book, published 2 years prior to Keeping Christ in Christmas. I wrote to the author in 2000, and he/his publisher said, in essence, this was okay, because the information was in the public domain/commonly known or something to that effect. If it's so commonly known, you don't need this book. If you want a more honest book, I recommend The Everything Christmas Book."
1,Broke and issues with USB port,"It took me a few days to get it running because plugging it into the USB ports on the front of my system didn't work; it had to go in the back. And this was not obvious. We figured that out, and got the music on it. The next morning I went to turn it and it was dead.I've bought an IPOD and I love it. Worth every extra penny."
1,Waste of my money,The product is considered non-stick. The eggs stuck to the cups and cleaning the cups took a while. Even soaking the cups didn't help. I bought these to avoid spending money on a $50.00 pan and poucher set but it wasn't worth it.
1,Disappointed,It would have been a nice napkin holder if it had arrived in good condition. The back of my item was all scratched up when I received it. I could not use it in that condition; I sent it back.
1,Chicken broth is not vegetarian!,"I stumbled across more than one recipe that called for a meat product. If someone prepared one of those recipes when cooking for a vegetarian friend or family member, he/she might not understand the guest's objection to eating the dish.The editors should have paid more attention."
1,Tennis balls,"These balls are okay. They don't have alot of bounce. We were given a Wilson foam ball from a tennis pro at the tennis club, and it plays much better."
1,Poorly Written,"What is this book about? The writing is so poor, it's difficult to say. This author needs to go back and learn basic grammar and sentence structure before trying his hand at some very compex issues."
1,not very good,This game is a very good game but very hard to play and takes up 400 mb on your computer also is very slow. If you want a better game but still almost the same theme for a cheaper price just buy age of empiers 2 and it expantion pack. It is a lot better than this game.
1,not yet shipped,"i ordered over 2 weeks ago and my order still hasn't shipped, its sad the thing i ordered first hasn't shipped and everything else already arrived."
1,CD doesn't work for MACs,"The book is fine, but I bought it for the CD, which will not work on my MAC. The book specifically says the CD will work on MACs, so it is very frustrating and I will be returning this book for one that comes with a working CD."
2,WOW,"All I can say is that you must get this movie. This is one of the finest films I have ever seen. Please buy this,if not for yourself than for me.I loved Nigel Hawthorne and Rupert Everett in this film. I especially liked when Hawthorne say ,""WHAT, WHAT."" After almost every word."
2,Great Buy!,The CD is great - I love Joshua Radin. Great buy! Fast shipping and product just as described.
2,Exciting Movie!!,"Good acting, interesting story. Have seen it four times already, and will watch it again in the future."
2,Legit but hard,"This is certainly the real deal. But like any other flying toy, it takes a lot of practice. I keep throwing it such that it bends left a lot when it slows down."
2,a very fine album,"I bought this album on vinyl and enjoyed it until I wore the record out. Many folks seem to think it sucks, but hey, it sounds great to me. It looks like they didn't have a wealth of original material to record. However, the originals are fine and the covers are great. Joni Mitchell's ""For Free"" and the Neil Young covers are excellent. Now what about all those other good albums released on Asylum? You know, Souther, Hillman Furay's two albums, Chris Hillman's albums, Richie's solo stuff..."
2,Rolodex Laptop stand is a great addition for home office,"The Rolodex laptop stand is a great addition to a home office. Not only does it give a more useful position for a laptop, it provides additional cooling for the laptop. The mesh construction allows better airflow, set the desired angle for typing and viewing and the metal construction is sturdy and does not flex when you are typing. A very useful product."
2,Finality!,"I love this set, it come with a ton of stars of all sizes asnd a ton of stickers to place everywhere! i good buy indee and came fast!"
2,Saves my teeth,I like the soft one however I do bite through it the harder one last longer but my jaw likes the soft one. I have recomended it to other family members
2,The best EVER,"This whole Video was awesome. Buy It! The Hart vs. Hart was cool, and the Hart vs. Yokozuna was awesome. Jerry Lawler was hilarious. The HBK vs. Razor Ladder Match was one of the best ever. Buy this now. You will not regret it."
2,Excellent book!,"It's a shame this book is out of print, since its subject is very much alive and well, despite a change of scenery.Conspiracies are one thing; political sentiment and bias is one thing; but ultimately there are knowable facts, and the facts thereby suggest conclusions, but they also exclude other ideas definitively, and it may be that where a subject of secrecy is concerned, the latter is the most valuable contribution one can make. This book does the job admirably."
2,Love it,Love it...love Elvis and this was a pretty good movie. I really enjoyed it and would recommend it to others.
2,Lucky You,My grandson loved the scent and it was as described. It was ideal for a teenager not too strong which was good.
2,Wonderful book based on period memoirs,"This is very well written historical fiction which deserves to be much better known. Fowler clearly read many historical memoirs before writing this, and recaptures their flavor so well that I occasionally found myself forgetting I was reading fiction. At the same time, the narrative is more continuous and dramatic than one would normally get in a memoir. There are a few very minor historical errors, but in most cases the research seems impeccable. If I have a criticism of this book, it's that it doesn't transcend its memoir basis quite enough: it could use more drama, more extremity. Still, it is very, very good, generally on a par with Killer Angels and much better than the wordy and hyperintellectual Cold Mountain."
2,pure bars,"Highly recommend, I ordered the variey pack and will continue to do so, all flavors were great. Great price, great value, great product and fast shipping."
2,Nothing Like Espresso from Fresh Beans,"This grinder produced a perfect fine grind to make espresso and also Automatic drip coffee. It is like having a coffee shop in your kitchen every morning. You haven't had coffee until you have had it ground fresh with this grinder.I saw some complaints about coffee grinds shooting out of the container. This can easily be avoided by pressing the bean container against the unit, thus eliminating any grinds from leaving the bean container OR automatic doser.Excellent product and any espresso or coffee lover would be lost without one."
2,"Simple, Deep,True and very rewarding!!!","What Maharaj teaches is something so simple, not relating to any religion but to just life itself in general as one. This is a spiritual path worth taking. Like he mentioned you have interest into what you are seeking, inquire ceaselessly into the IAm and realize that what you are not. This book has opened new dimensions into how I perceive this life. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!"
2,Not as bad as the other reviews say,"Yes, it is true. These are NOT the original arrangements or recordings of these top 70's hits. But they ARE by the original artists. Some are very close to what I fondly remember, others are not that close. Of those that aren't very close- about half are ""meh"" but the other half still sounds good, even if not quite as I remember them.But the price here is good and there's a lot of great music and hard to get tunes for the price.So, as long as you know that by and large these will sound a little different that the originals, it's a great bargain."
2,Good break down,"The book uses common words and ideas to explain the theories and practice calculus. If you've ever used any dummies book, and liked it, then you'll also like this one. If you haven't been a fan of dummies books then you won't like this one either because its the same humor and teaching style."
2,Love it,I love this film. The big foot creation by Rick Baker is amazing! Nice story with a good message.
2,muy bueno,"exelente producto, saludos me gusta y esta super muy bueno exelente articulo para cuatrimotos buenisimo equipo de caja y mucho"
2,A Must See,"Wow! This movie is like nothing I've ever seen before. It was a really great movie. I have nothing but good things to say about this tasteful and heartwarming film. I think that the effort of the film's director/writer is courageous as well as inspirational. I loved this film not only for the fantastic story (which needed to be told), but also for the way the actors delivered the story. This is not another shallow ""gay movie"" that depicts stereotypical characters in humorous situations. This was a memorable and flawless effort to show people that love truly knows no bounds, and love is still as beautiful and wonderful as it always was. Another thing that touched my heart was how well I could relate to the emotion portrayed in this film surrounding the coming out of one of the main characters. We all have to go through similar situations living in the society that we live in and feeling that feeling of detachment from everything that is ""right"" and ""normal""."
2,good read from a solid teacher,"very inspiring ,informative eye opener easy to read book a call for us Christians especially in this era when its very easy to be busy doing many things not giving time for the Lord"
2,"Generation ""X"" At It's Best!","Lately, Hollywood has been making some cheesy, shallow teen flicks with no meaning or depth. But, ""Never Been Kissed"" is different. Much different. Josie had a really bad high school experience (and when I say bad I mean my heart sinks every time I think about it). But, now she gets a chance to go back and redeem herself...undercover for a big city newspaper. Needless to say, she goes back and the result is an excellent, funny, and heartfelt film that will sure stick with you! Wonderful entertainment..."
2,Another Solid Tek Adventure,"In the second novel of Shatner's ""Tek"" series, future sleuth Jake Cardigan is back and trying to rebuild a life with his new girlfriend Beth. The Tek lords have been busy though, and have created a new and deadly weapon,a synthetic plague, in order to blackmail world leaders into permitting Tek. Jake's search for the cause, and cure of the plague lead him through the usual deadly adventures to a climactic battle with an unexpected enemy in Japan.Much like the first ""Tek"" novel, this is a fast paced sci-fi/mystery that doesn't go overboard on the plot development. It's got a lot to enjoy though, with non-stop adventure, a budding romance, and an edge of mystery that will keep the pages turning. If you enjoyed 'Tekwar', than you won't be disappointed with 'Teklords', and Shatner continues to do a great job developing his reluctant hero Jake Cardigan."
2,Great kitchen,"We have had this kitchen for our son for 2 years and it is holding up very well. It is a lot of fun and quite sturdy. Try as we might we went through a phase where he liked to open the oven door and stand on it. Well, it took that misuse very well. We have not had any issues with this kitchen. I love the neutral colors. Who says only girls should play with kitchens? So many of them are all pink! Plenty of chefs are men so encouraging, supporting and making kitchens that work for boys or girls appealed to me when I was trying to decide which kitchen to buy. Enjoy!"
2,My Favorite Worship CD Ever,"When this CD came out in 2000 it immediately became my favorite worship recording, and now, 9 years later, it still holds that position! This 2-CD collection is a compilation of 22 of the greatest praise songs, recorded by the original artists.This is truly music for worship. I love to listen to it on a long drive, when I have nothing to do but worship. It feeds my soul and draws me into a sense of God's presence.When I hear Don Moen's ""Give Thanks,"" Keith Green's ""There Is a Redeemer,"" Darlene Zscheck's ""Shout to the Lord,"" Delirious' ""I Could Sing of Your Love Forever,"" and Marty Nystrom's ""I Will Call Upon the Lord."" I cannot help but worship.Well worth the cost. Highly recommended. A fantastic recording!"
2,"As ""Wonderful, Wonderful"" as Ever!!",Excellent CD and a must for all Mathis fans. Johnny sounds as mellow as ever!!!
2,Can't put down,I love Nicholas Sparks! I haven't read a book by him that I could put down! I recommend ALL of them.
2,WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE,"Unbelievable! This book turned my world around, led me to two glamourous jobs one after the other, and overall has brought me more happiness than any other i've read. Be it in or out of the workplace! It will shake your old beliefs and give you an undaunted self-confidence: you'l feel ready to take over the world. Combined with Cameron Tuttle's ""the bad girl's guide to getting what you want"", it's explosive! Thanks, Kate..."
2,Well worth the money,This is well worth the money and time that would be wasted on changing batteries. charges fast too.
2,Works Great,"Our two small dogs completely destroyed the pan that came with their crate about three years ago, and Amazon had this replacement for much less than the pet stores. It is made by the company who manufactured our crate (which we are VERY happy with, by the way) and fit perfectly. I don't expect it to last forever... our two little dogs get bored in the crate (even with a lot of toys) and chew on the edges of the pan, but if I have to buy one of these every three years at least I'm not breaking the bank doing so."
2,Are You Being Served?? the MOVIE,"It was great seeing the characters from Are You Being Served...a cute movie with the ""Grace Brothers"" theme. Mr. Humphries in various costumes & the lovely ladies on vacation.No audience participation, but the show is still lots of laughs. If you love the original show & the humor of Captain Peacock, Mrs. Slocum and the rest, the movie is fun. Even the shop serviceman Mr. Harmon is around to irk the players! A comedy of errors when notes get passed around, and romance (by mistake) is in the air!"
2,Planet Earth,"This is an amazing video-it could not be better. Great information, beautiful video, the entire family (including college kids) enjoys it!"
2,excellent well documented book,As an ex-catholic I am grateful that I was saved out of the papal pagan system.Thanks to the honesty of brave God-fearing men like Dave Hunt the truth be told!
2,a great book for all die-hard Nascar fans!,I loved this book! It taught me a lot about what goes on in one week of a racing team.I always respect what the drivers have to do-but I also gained a new respect for the hard working pit crew!This is a must have book for Nascar fans!
2,Pilates,Great DVD set. It is good for beginners on to expert exercising. I can stop and start the CD whenever I like so it's also convenient.
2,"One time, at band camp...","American Pie. Don't watch this movie if you're looking for a biography on Don McLean! What you'll find is a funny, irreverant, but sometimes sick movie. Anyone who's been through high school will be able to relate to nearly every scene in this movie, and will find humor at every turn. The only reason that this movie wouldn't receive 5 stars is due to some of the extremely graphic content, unfortunately geared towards teenagers. Other than that, this movie has a great screenplay and some very memorable scenes... this is a ""can't miss"" movie!"
2,Great collection of Motown rarities,"This CD contains unreleased Christmas songs from Motown's major hit makers. My favorites are Marvin's Purple Snowflakes and the Supremes' Silent Night, with Florence on lead. Diana does a solo act on This Christmas, and there's a great instrumental from the Funk Brothers on Winter Wonderland as well. It's out of print, but you're into the Motown sound, get this CD to add to your collection."
2,What a book!,"The Boxcar Children is one of my favorite books. Its author is Gertrude Chandler .It is about adventure and mystery .Its about 4 kids, Henry, Violet, Benny and Jessie. They are huerphans and think that their grandfather doesn`t like them, so they escape from him and have a lot of adventures in the city and on the town.One day on a rainy night they manage to stay the night in a bakery but they end up escaping from the baker`s wife. When they have walked a little bit they find a forest. They find a boxcar in the middle of the bushes. Its their perfect oportunity to settle down in a good place and to start a new life.Well at last they settle there for a long time. Henry gets a job, Benny learns how to read and Jessie and Violet learn to cook. But a big surprise is coming up. Will their grandpa ever get them? The only way to figure it out is reading the book."
2,Waves of Blood,"The Pacific War of World War II was fought from San Francisco to India. It involved vast movements of huge fleets filled with hundreds of thousands of men, locked in a death grip with each other to decide whose world-view would prevail. The beaches were soaked in blood.This collection of DVD's follows the conflict, fight by fight, as it surges from island to island in the great Pacific Ocean. The battle footage is not for the faint-hearted, for the struggle is lethal. These DVD's show the whole extant of the war, from the Japanese invasion of China to the start of the Korean War. This is one of the best DVD sets of it's subject matter for the price. In judging war, the truth is not always clear to us, so we must set it out for all to see. This Canadian company has done an excellent job of laying out the picture of a great war not so long ago."
2,Family Dance Favourite!,"Our whole family loves this simple CD with a Garage Band sound. Our kids say it rocks and they light up when they hear this version of Joy to the World. If you want to get all ages dancing, buy Classic Rock Christmas!"
2,Remembering the Human Factor,"This book reminds anyone working with others (read: everyone) something oft forgotten: organizational behavior is a human enterprise. Sanders makes three critical points in the book that help ""humanize"" business of every ilk: (1) Read so you can be an expert people can rely on; (2) Stay in touch with people because they are inherently valuable as people, and; (3) Treat people with compassion and love and they will tend to treat everyone else around them the same way.This is a simple (though deeply profound) formula for success in the most important endeavor in life: the human race!"
2,Plug and play,Ordered this after getting a CEL on 2001 Acura integra. This was a direct plug and play swap. Even came with tube of anti-seize for threads.
2,Science and sex make great suspense,"Not having read the ""Bosch"" stories, I didn't know what to expect from a Connelly book but Chasing the Dime was a fun and pleasing book to read. The story is centered around the main characters research firm working on nano-technology development. However, he gets lured into chasing a memory from the past that could ruin his future. The story ends up centered more around on-line prostitution, murder and haunting memories than science and what nano-technology holds in store for us (see Prey) but it keeps the story moving and enticing. The story ends with somewhat of a surprise, but not too surprising if you piece it all together.While Bosch fans might be disappointed, most readers will enjoy Chasing the Dime."
2,ok,Not as nice as the ones that were discontinued by another manufacturer but does the job - i like that i can put the dvd/cd in another case for transport and it still fits in the sleeve
2,Funny useless thing!,I bought them for the CD-RW of my daughter and it goes nicely with her strawberry iMac!
2,Good Compilation of Early MSG,"Michael Schenker is a great guitarist - one of the best in hard rock/metal. That being said, MSG albums have always been somewhat hit or miss. This collection does good job of taking the best from the first four MSG albums. The only glaring omissions are Never Trust A Stranger(from MSG) and Samurai(from Assault Attack). For an introduction to MSG, this is an excellent choice. Also check out McAuley Schenker Group - excellent albums with some of the strongest songwriting of any albums with Schenker."
2,only one problem,This was an excellent collection. I bought it as a gift for my dad. We listened to it together and the only complaint either of us had was the variation in volume between tracks. It wasn't mixed correctly so some songs were too loud or too quiet. Other than that one problem it was great.
2,Awesome score.,"This was the hardest for me to find, I had looked everywhere. Either it was too expensive or out of stock, I found it here on Amazon. This score fits the movie perfectly, capturing the feel exactly. My favorite track on the album is called Time to shine, I could listen to that all day. Anyway, a great soundtrack to a great film."
2,Easily the most disturbing fitness book ever written.,"Highly confusing and riddled with spelling and grammatical errors. Desperately in need of an index and table of contents.That said, if you want a complete fitness routine that requires no equipment and includes exercises for your p3nis and an excruciatingly detailed regimen for cleaning your sphincter, then this is the book for you."
2,Unbelieveable!!!,"The old Nas is back and better than ever. God's Son is easily one of the best rap albums of 2002. From beginning to end, you can feel the emotions flowing through his songs. My personal favorites are ""Made You Look"", ""Book of Rhymes (you can hear Nas reading from old books, flipping pages, tearing up wack rhymes, even though all of them are banging), ""Warrior Song"" (Alicia Keys does a GREAT job on this song, ""Heaven"" (another song dedicated to his mother featuring Jully Black, ""The Cross (produced by Eminem, really great beat) and Last Real Nigga Alive, which shows how everything went down from about 95 until now. Pick this up now.."
2,"Learn Essentials of ""Walking"" Bass Quickly",I have been playing bass for about two years and recently bought this book. The book and the CD are extremely well done and have advanced my playing very quickly. My bass teacher was very impressed by the orderly way in which the subject is taught and is recommending it to other students.
2,Horn of plenty,"This book is wonderful if you are looking for just the right finish for your design. The author is a great teacher, and the text is supplemented with examples of finished pieces highlighting the techniques described. This is good for beginners through advanced metalsmiths. Each technique has photographs of samples telling what the base metal is and how the surface was achieved. This is one book to turn to over and over again as you design and bring your pieces to completion."
2,The best Sarah album ever,"I got this album given to me and although I liked the only song I was familiar with (Good Enough) it sat on my shelf for about a year. My best friend then told me it was awesome and I should really listen to it, I did, it is now one of my favorite albums ever!! Every track is amazing, some took a while to grow on me (Circle, Mary, Ice Cream) but they did and I love them all. Possession is of course one of the highlights of this album. A powerful song that overwhelmes you. Fear, Ice, Hold On, Elsewhere, and Fumbling Towards Ecstasy are extraordinary. I love all of Sarah's albums, but this one will always be untouchable!"
2,Bazz hx,"This is one of the lastest and greatest from the BBC. Long overdue.Each character has their own story line which is interwoven with the others in a compelling saga.If you like this, also check out Larkrise to Candleford, another excellent period drama from the BBC."
2,Very readable,"Works have been noted by Prestel and other publishers that are neither as inclusive, nor as useful. The author here has selected a large number of woman artists both known and unknown to me with reasonable biographies, maybe 4 to 8 representative works, each reproduced with high-quality illustrations and these generally with reasonable texts concerning these works.Some might seek to add or subtract some artists, but I would contend that one is not likely to find any work that is superior to this one."
2,"Pretty good info, Doesn't instill as much ""critical thinking""","I work in a world where critical thinking skills are a must, so for things like this you should have more exercises that are ""at your own pace"" and ""figure it out yourself"" type of deal.This book is also horribly lacking the ability to check how close your Office document that YOU made to their example. It's no use if you don't know how well you did. Things can look similar, but there are probably errors here-or-there.It's fairly comprehensive, but like I said, since you don't really use your brain much, you don't really gain the ability to do these type of things on your own."
2,The very best book on devotion to Mary,"In short, if you could read only one book in your life, this should it. It is life changing in power and scope. There isn't a better book on Marian spirituality in print."
2,Auto Ventshade 94623 Ventvisor 4-Piece Smoke,Quick and easy to install with high quality tape to adhere to the truck. Instructions were plain and simple and these have gone thru many a car wash with no problems.
2,Just What I Wanted!,"I bought these pet steps for my six week old puppy who wasn't big enough to jump on the bed and I didn't want to have to pick him up and put him down all day and night. They work beautifully and he loves them. He is now almost four months old and steadily uses like them a pro. Even the four year-old dog loves to use them as well because he has short legs and is too stubborn to try and jump up. I think my two cats enjoy them the most though, because they camp out on the top step and pounce on their victims below.I am very happy with my purchase and so are my pets. The steps are sturdy and built reasonably well. They are tall enough to reach my bed which is on risers and they are still in perfect shape without a scratch on them. I would highly recommend this product and even though I never tried other brands of petsteps, these are my #1 and only recommended choice."
2,extra heat,"this little guy is so cool or should I say hot! 16"" tall X 8"" wide diameter. It has a remote, oscillates, high low setting, 4 settings for temperature and 4 settings for timed running of the heater. The air flow of heat is perfect. I bought two!"
2,Smooth and Rich,"A friend brought a high quality black tea straight from London for me to try. I didn't have the heart to tell her, but the Yorkshire tea beat it hands down. This tea manages to have a very rich, bracing, flavor without any sharp edges to it.I normally drink gourmet quality, loose tea in Oolong, green, white, Mate, and sometimes black. I will still always choose the Yorkshire when I crave black, even over the high grade loose. All you have to do is put a little milk and sugar in it and you will not find a more satisfying cup of black tea to be had anywhere. Thank you Taylors of Harrogate for getting it exactly right and at a good price."
2,Fields of Plenty/Food for thought,"Remarkably readable, high density information, exquisite quality content and book-paper, photos. Makes compelling reading > action for life on a small planet for locavores, opens ideas for subscription food buying to support locally grown food. Hopeful and realistic - also opens ideas for alternatives to mainstream anxiety (natural and media generated). Everyday people w/ a passion for their unique talents ""stay the course"" in the best sense of the idea."
2,Losing Chase is excellent.,This movie is deeper than it may seem on the first viewing. It has much to say about relationships and about healing of relationships in life.
2,Rap album of the year??/,"This album is a rare gym. It provides tight tracks, great lyrics and creates a nice party mood. There are few albums that do this well. Most often, you have to chose between good lyrics and party music.Busta continues to grow as an artist and creates a very memorable album. There are a lot of artist that need to analyze this disk."
2,feathered phonics the easywirds ti teach your bird,"I do not like this some people might,I didn't know it was pirates phashes.I will sent it back for something else."
2,Detailed description of the Fur Trade and Mountain Men,A detailed description of the Fur Trade that opened the West to further settlement. Discusses the lifestyles of the mountain trappers and the devotes a great deal of time to the business end of the trade
2,"Excellent introduction to retail in business, cultural customs","I'll point to the already existing reviews on this page as insightful enough as to the book's contents, but do also want to iterate that this book does stretch to some other lesser-known or recognized holidays in America, including Devil's Night, Sweetest Day, Hanukkah, and Kwanzaa.Great introduction to business-retail cycles and holiday traditions in general.Design is also excellent, although those who have limited eyesight might need a magnifying glass. As befits most polished graphic design packages, the text can be a bit small. But the photos are telling enough and overall it's a pleasurable read."
2,Don't miss this one,"I'd gladly pay $50 to for this recording. Not only do I think it's just as good as the popular Nonesuch recording with Upshaw, I think it's better hands down. Kilanowisz voice is just outstanding for this piece, blending in with the breathtaking harmonies and emotion of the piece rather than sounding like she's performing an opera aria. The Warsaw Symphony orchestra is rich and thick and produces an amazing harmonies and overtones that won't hear on the Nonesuch recording. Kilanowisz voice is up to the power of this full size orchestra from the lowest notes to the highest. Together, they bring Gorecki's symphony to life in a way that will be tough to surpass. A must have for any fan of Gorecki's 3rd!"
2,Excellent book,"This is an excellent book for anyone interested in clincial theory and practice in working with the bereaved. The diversity of views of bereavement in the various chapters gives a sound, honest sense of the diversity of views in the field of bereavement. Many of the chapters deal with bereavement in the Israeli context, and I think that is a strength. Viewing things from an Israeli context makes it clearer how culture, history, politics, and national sociology are entangled in bereavement and the processes and challenges in treating it. Also, I would say that even though the book is written for professionals and scholars interested in trauma and bereavement, many other readers will find the insights, case studies, and other information of great value."
2,Is the Pot Calling the Kettle Black?,"James Fallows certainly deserves credit for writing an interesting and clearly presentedargument for media reform. However, Fallows' tenure at U.S. News has thus far failed to deliver any of the reforms he touts in his book. A recent study I did of U.S. News articles for 1997 shows that most articles regarding American politics still follow the ""Game"" schema. That is, the focus is on who's winning and who's losing rather than what the issues are. To be sure, Fallows has brought a bit more coverage of the issues themselves, and more significant change may take time. Still, Fallows is quick to criticize journalists turned television pundits in his book. Yet Gloria Borger, a U.S. News columnist, points out at the end of each and every column she writes that she is also a CBS political analyst (read: pundit). Fallows has some good ideas, but as he is learning first hand, when trying to put theory into practice, things sometimes get lost in the translation."
2,Another great album from Parokya.,When I first heard the song The Ordertaker i was amazed how they spoofed the song from System of a Down's Toxicity and ChopSuey. This Album is really great. No regrets.
2,GREATEST... GAME... EVER!,"First things first: this is not ground-breaking in the world of video games like Wii Sports. This is ground-breaking in the world of platformers (a type of video game). Expect to see Sonic, Crash, and others copy Mario's latest styles from Galaxy. This game gets addicting quick. You can find more in-depth reviews around the net, so I won't bore you with what you have probably already read. If you own a Wii, get the game. If you don't own a Wii, get that then the game."
2,This CD is pretty cool,"This CD isn't quite as good as ""Evildoers Beware,"" but it deserves more credit than it deserves. There are many cool songs on it, like ""Send You Back"" and ""Everything Girl."" Also, the versions of ""Lolita"" and ""We're Gonna Take on the World"" are a lot better than when they were on ""Hopelessly Devoted to You, Too."" The only big problem with this CD was that it didn't have ""The Freshman"" on it. You can only get it on the internet. Oh well, that's what burners are for, but it would have been better on the CD."
2,Good product,Been using product for a month now and gives excellant sound and comfort and for just $14.99 at a good price. I've a large head and had no problems watching movies and listing to music.
2,Great Sequel,"This is probably the best sequel, well it is the most entertaining one, that is. This time Rocky, who is living in a mansion and rich is being challenged by a tough boxer Clubber Lang (MR.T, fool) who beats the sh-t out of Rocky and takes his title, so Apollo Creed steps in and trains Rocky to beat Lang, who also killed Mickey (Rocky's former manager). It also stars Hulk Kogan as a wrestler named thunderlips who fights Rocky in a Boxer vs. Wrestler charity match. This is a great movie so watch it, fool."
2,i'm speechless,"This is just too awesome for words. I've spent my whole life learning the rap and science I need to fully enjoy this, and now, finally, it is worth it."
2,Such books make life worth living. A master piece.,It is a narration of the Life and Teachings of Buddha written by divine inspiration by Edwin Arnold. Rev Angarica the founder of Mahabodhi Society was deeply inspired by this book whereafter he took the Buddhist Robes. I have read the book several times and propose to read it many more times. Each reading elevates you some what. Any one who wants the book for free may contact me atnavinkumar@hotmail.com.
2,Great Hardware Addition.,"I've had this for a couple of weeks now and so far so good. The only noticeable problem I can think of, is the Wii remote strap cord getting in the way when placing the Wii remote in the charger, but this alone does no justify giving this charging station a low score. It works. It simply works. You'll be replacing the original Wii battery covers for the ones supplied with the charger. Reason being, the covers that come with this unit have an opening for the rechargeable battery contacts.Another thing you should know. As somebody here already mentioned, the Wii remote jacket does not fit in this charger. And quite honestly and logically, it is expected. I don't think any charger out there is wide enough to accomodate the Wii remote plastic jacket.All in all. This unit is great. It works as described. My Wii remotes are always ready to go."
2,Beautiful!,"I will be the first to admit that I am no expert on musical talent - but to paraphrase Justice Stewart: I know it when I hear it. I bought this CD after seeing Julie Albers perform Elgar's Cello Concerto, and I love every piece on it."
2,Excellent descriptions of rural Brazil -- well-written,"While this book measured up to Grisham's previous ones in terms of suspense, his placement of the setting in Brazil was really a welcome change. His descriptions of rivers, people, weather, and more were not just right-on-the-money, but so descriptive that you could paint a complete mental picture. Folks, that's an example of good writing."
2,Sweet!!!!!!,I have an older computer with two USB ports and love this product. Price is right. I bought it and also a longer USB cord. That brought my hook up to other devices to my desktop for quick and easy connections. Love it!!!!
2,A Fun Collector's Video From Your Childhood,"""Feeling brave tonight?"" Then this might be what your looking for. Originally released with the ""Dragon Strike"" board game by TSR this video is an introduction to the game. Filmed in ""Hyper-Vision"" this 20 min. video was a fun, corny thrill ride through a Dungeons & Dragons style adventure. If your a fan of any Dungeons & Dragons related game or collectors items you will love this. As a fan and player myself, this is what got me into ""DND"" when I was a kid."
2,Intense and beautiful,"Kelly Joe Phelps plays blues guitar like nobody else I've ever heard. His guitar playing is a highly unconventional, intense, sometimes furious, lyrical, almost freeform backdrop to his stories. Fascinating to watch him, hunched over the guitar laid on his lap, seemingly lost in his own little world.The voice that tells the stories is smoky, also intense, focused. The songs on this album seem mysterious (like the title of the album) at first because you don't hear the lyrics for a while, just the words - but the words seem interesting and emotive all by themselves, even when you haven't tuned in to the meaning.Tuning in is an essential part of listening to this album. You won't get to know the songs unless you listen a few times. Probably many times. Then the rapid-fire guitar starts to make sense, you begin to hear what he's saying, and you'll start to really enjoy it."
2,a shattering ending to a rather slow book,"Though I consider this book a masterpiece I personally like ""Animal Farm"" better. The ending of 1984 is fantastic..shocking and all around genius...but before reaching that climax, one is exposed to a long and dreary relationship that is based more on hate of their surrounding then actual love. I wish Orwill had paid just a little more attention to the characters. They could have made the book go by a little faster. then again he was a conceptual writer and never really paid much attention to his charactes. Its the message that counts not the content...and the message is a warning about big government presented by BB himself."
2,Mapping The Internal Landscape,"Damage is about truth. Damage is about love. Damage is about an honesty so revealing it's frightening. Josephine Hart examines an english man's search for fulfilling the 'internal landscape' of one's soul, and the need to fill an emptiness through another; no matter how selfish the need becomes. Damage is about stripping away the outside facade and exposing the bare reality of that fulfillment. Damage is about the courage to see beyond society and tradition, and in doing so, the painful reality of those actions"
2,Great,The gift was well received - seemed to be made very well. Would probably buy another one if I had someone in mind.
2,Great DVD/must have for a volatility trades,This is a great book and explains a lot from Nateberg's Book Option volatility and pricing....would recommend this highly and explains 1 /2/3 Standard deviation moves..Tastytrades will love this book
2,"Last, but not the least of the series","I had not read Mr. Martin before this series. I am amazed at his character development and how he immerses you in his world. He writes in an unhurried manner and while the books are lengthy, they don't seem overlong. I have become attached to the characters, flaws and all. All in all, it's a great read. I would recommend Martin to anyone mature enough to appreciate him."
2,Outstanding Anthropology Reader,This book is essential for any student of anthropology. It has a complete set of anthropological articles and is a create reference for essays and assignments.
2,A Great Read!,"I read this book in the tub. I found myself adding hot water with my toe and reading ""just two more chapters"" until the book and my prune toes were done. The quirky characters and unlikely relationships are delightful. You will be mulling the identity of the murderer from the first page.Being from the same area of Oklahoma as Mrs. Letts, it is fun to see the occasional local name attached to a character. This book was great and her other books are even better!"
2,Great Screen,"Exactly what I needed. Well constructed. Very pleased. It is quite large, so less suitable for portability but I plan to use it mainly at home and serves my needs well. Might get another smaller one for road shows."
2,Voices in the Mirror,This is an excellent book and all young people should read this. It contains history lessons that will open ones eyes.
2,Great book!,"Our 20 month old daughter loves this book. She can say a lot of the words and is learning more as we read it together. Beautiful, clear, colorful pictures!"
2,What's this I hear about Green Day selling out????,"Seems like no new artist can go by without being accused of selling out. Sure, Korn and Offspring sold out, but Green Day?I've been a fan of them since 1994, when Dookie came out. I got the disc and couldn't put it down. Then when this came out, I was so excited. I got it from Columbia House (a music club I belong to that's about to kick me out). I loved it. Now I am reading this sh*t about Green Day selling out on Amazon. Let me clear it up: THEY DIDN'T. QUIT SAYING THAT! And yes, I DID hear some 1039/Smoothed Out Slappy Hours songs. Green Day did NOT sell out! They're still as great as they were in '94.by the way, I wrote another review. April 28. I'm the guy who's the ""Official Imitation Mascot of the new millenium""...something."
2,Fantastic,"Tom Perrotta is a fantastic author. His prose is a delight, and is always in service of the story, never to show off what a good writer he is. His characters are nuanced and compelling -- people you can identify with, or at least understand, even when they are making terrible choices that might wreck their own lives, and those of their loves ones.I found it particularly impressive that Perrotta manages to get in the mind of the child molester, so that, despite his atrocious tendencies and crimes, he comes across not as a monster, but as a profoundly flawed and ill human being.This was the first book by Perrotta I read. It won't be the last."
2,"Not perfect, but satisfying","If you're looking for action-packed or lots of blood, this isn't the film for you. There are a few mostly useless ""scream-inducing cat jumping out at the protagonist"" type moments.I watched on Instant Video, so none of the awkward editing mentioned by another reviewer. The Caller is a slow-paced thriller, very reminiscent of some of Hitchcock's works. It does require that you think to enjoy the story."
2,"Great Bluetooth device that is light, functional and easily attaches to the ear","After reading various user reviews I decided to purchase this Samsung WEP200, and I am glad I did. I have it synched with my RIZR phone and it works great, the sound is very clear with no distortion and can be heard very clearly both ways. The ear bud is sooo nice , it stays in the ear, very light and never falls off. It does have a somewhat limited range for clear sound, but for me I only need to use it when my cell is very near by or in my belt, not the type that wonders around in the house or go outside in the gardern with the with the blutooth in my ear. I highly recommend this product."
2,Eats Shoots and Leaves for air traffic communication,"The sub-title is a clue to the linguistic complexities covered. Cushing makes extensive reference to accident reports and NASA Aviation Safety Reporting System submissions by US pilots.Part 1 covers language based communication problems (i.e. ambiguities, uncertainties and inferences)Part 2 covers on-language based problems (e.g. numbers, radios, non-compliance etc)Part 3 focuses on a way forward based on computer program techniques"
2,The Bourne Legacy,"Hey - I thought this book was fantastic. I have read this book in 2 days times as it was that good to put down. I am now waiting for the last book ""The Bourne Reality"" to come out."
2,Replacing VHS Tapes,"Due to the change over of VHS to DVD, we had to replace our favorite Les Miserables. This was the exact presentation we had before and we are very happy to have been able to order it from Amazon and put it in our collection."
2,Very nostolgic,"This story is nicely depicting the true events happening in Iran after revolution. I, as a person who grew up with the same situation, totally enjoyed reading this book.I strongly recommend this book to every Iranian (or non Iranian) who has left Iran, and been through the bloody war."
2,Good overview for the time period,"This book gets a lot of pretty harsh reviews for the print edition by people complaining that it's geared towards the lay person with an interest in Anglo-Saxon Britain. Personally, I think it's a very good overview for someone who's starting their exploration of the ""Dark Age"" period in the island's history and does an excellent job dispelling myths about post-Roman Britain. It's a quick and easy read, and a good way to get a better understanding of what we know (and what we don't know) about the AS period. Think of it as a transition between the ""one chapter"" you'll get in most history books or mass-market publications and the scholarly (and sometimes mind-numbingly dry) tomes you can find gathering dust on a lot of library shelves."
2,When I was arrested I was dressed in black,"I am a new fan of country and of Johnny Cash. This was the first soundtrack I've ever bought before even seeing the movie, which I saw twice!Joaquin does an amazing job!! He doesn't try to sound exactly like Johnny, but he's not meant to. He has an excellent sound of his own.I can't take this cd out of my cd player, it's so good."
2,Great Series,Cant wait for season two!Thought is did a very nice job of showing a timeline and detail for the major business/industrial/finance events that shaped america during the 1800's and 1900's.
2,Memorable,"I'm almost 30. Throughout my life I have read hundreds of books, maybe thousands but this fairy tale book is the most memorable. The stories are fascinating and unique. It is the most colorful, imaginative display of eye-catching illustrations and story telling.If you have kids, this is a MUST HAVE. It will stay with them for years. I still read it!"
2,A defining moment in American history,"Author Garry Wills is unequivocal in his admiration for Abraham Lincoln and his brief speech, which became arguably the most famous oration of American history. In this fascinating book, he places the Gettysburg Address in context, explaining the political philosophy that inspired it, the literary precedents that gave it form, and the social/historical milieu that influenced the individuals who were present. There are many interesting tidbits here, including the culture of death that existed in the 19th century and the way it influenced the evolution of cemeteries, the influence of classical Greek oratory on the structure of the address, and Lincoln's careful attention to the written word."
2,avidrdr,"I really, really, enjoyed this book written by Waylon Jennings, since I am a fan of his. He tells the story ""like it is"" and I applaud the honesty. I would recommend this book to all country music lovers."
2,I Think that.......,Look people napster has been dead for over two years now. Its time to move on. Metallica was the only band with the balls to sue them over what they stole from so many bands.-Besides Metallica has kicked ass for over 20 years now and they really don't care what you think...Because your all to cheap to go out and actually buy the albums!-I like this album Some Kind Of Monster and Frantic are awsome songs. And ST. ANGER sounds even better live then on the album! You really need to hear it for your self!-I find it hard to lable a band Sellouts when they spent millions of there own money to make an independed documentary. An tour more than any other band that I have ever heard of.(my point: yes they do make a little on the side But most of there income they actually work for! and that rare today!)-So next time you fell like bashing a band for no good reason just remember that. And there are better ways to hold a grudge.
2,Great for Suitable Cordless Phones,"I bought this headset to plug into myPhilips VOIP841 PC-Free DECT 6.0 Wireless IP PhoneandPhilips VOIP 321 Skype Dual Phone Single Handset ( VOIP3211G/37 )to let me call into teleconferences whilst still having my hands free to type.Pros:- Compatibility: Worked without issues with both my cordless phones.- Features: The headset allows adjustment of earpiece and microphone volumes which allows the headset to be tweaked to work optimally for the phone and user. Also, having a mute switch on the cable control module is very useful.- Audio Quality: Incoming voices come in loud and clear and I've never had any complaints about my voice being unclear.- Comfort: I wear this for at least an hour at a time and have never felt uncomfortable wearing it. There is the usual adjustable headband, the microphone boom can be moved and the earpiece can be worn on either ear.Cons:- A version with two earpieces rather than just one would have been preferable."
2,Amazing DVD & Special Features!,"Not only was Rosa Parks a great movie, the whole DVD was fantastic. I especially appreciated the Civil Rights Timeline feature. It is one of the few special features I have seen which was really worth looking at, rather than the typical self promotion DVDs usually contain."
2,"Wild, Wild West by Rosser",This is a great product. This is one of my alltime favorite shows. I received my order promptly and in excellent condition. Great job!!
2,The Whistler XTR-140 Radar/Laser Detector,"Whistler XTR-140 Radar/Laser DetectorI like this item. It does pick up the signals of electronic doors,but all in all it does work great for the price.LuAnn WillMilwaukee Wisconsin"
2,A unique read,Quick review: Very unique voice. Was a pleasure to read. Excellent Social Anthropological details contained within. Highly recommended. Made me want to learn 3 cushion.
2,"Great, works well.","I've been very happy with this cover, fits over the phone nicely. I've had no difficulties using the camera - when the phone is open you may have to make an adjustment to one of the straps, but is easily moved out of the way of the lens and stays out of the way. The cover all in all has held up, protects the phone and is not overly bulky."
2,Classic Repeat 7 years later,Dre you really came back on this one Good Beats Good Featured artist and all Dre you have proven your legacy with 2 of 3 attempts I never heard the Aftermath album and I dont need to times was bad at that point and time but anyway This is a good albumLyrics 8.5/10 Beats 12/10 (if you're wondering why I said 12 of 10 just listen to this constant head bobbing check it out)
2,Both irreverant and reverant,"I was struck first by the creativity of Buechner. Godric was a historic figure, but Buechner's fleshing him out and delving into his soul were much more fascinating than the interesting historic facts. Secondly I was stuck by how well the story is crafted, in style and character development and progression of the story. There are scattered gems of commentary on human nature and theology. As other reviewers have pointed out, while part of us is appalled at some of Godric's thoughts and deeds, another part of us recognizes these dark shortcomings in ourselves. A book about humanity, sin and grace. Strangely, though a book that is at times raunchy and violent and appalling, it is also an honest book that can strengthen faith. Godric will be hard to forget."
2,Faster for simple taxes than Turbotax,"If you have just a W2, some interest and dividends, along with a simple mortgage, TaxCut gets you through the interview process faster than Turbotax. I was in and out in 30 minutes including State. By the way don't download State prior to installing Taxcut Federal since State will not load without Federal.I'd give them 5 stars but their rebate process is excessively complex."
2,Well Written,"Very little of this book was new or unexpected material, still it is easily and quickly read and often corroborates other books that I have read and a period of time I remember.Beverly J Scott"
2,greatest little $12 piece of equipment ever,"These little microscopes are the greatest little invention. They do just what they are supposed to do magnify stuff alot. The device is easy to operate, have a great little led, and can be carried in your pocket. I would advise any one wanting a little carry-around microscope to scoop this baby up. I give this device a 4.9 out of 5 rating. I took 1/10 a point off for the small eyehole, but it would be difficult to put a larger eyepiece on this little device. BUY IT."
2,good read,"I had to read this for class, but it turns out to be a really good book. I like his examples of how integrity is defined in his scenarios, and what is NOT integrity. Basically, the book defines the word integrity.Verdict: Recommended buy."
2,Love the classics,I got these for my mom she is so happy we were able to get them. I have to say they bring back great memories of Sunday mornings watching the old movies with my parents. Just great!
2,AWESOME,"This is an awesome video it has Gospel Gangstaz, Kirk Fanklin, Trinitee 5:7, Walter Hawkins and etc. B-Rite and Gospo Centric put this wonderful video together and it is worth ordering and you can get your praise on! It really is good for when you feel like watching a music video and chillin at the house!!"
2,THE BEST,"How can you have anything but positive comments for Ms. Hill's first cd without the Fugees? After the first time I listened to it, I knew this was going on permanent status on my CD player. Every track is the bomb and even though I don't agree with her religious beliefs, I am very proud that she has the courage to speak about what she believes in with conviction and force. She's a powerful woman and this is a great CD."
2,"Great overview, easy to understand","I thought this was a very thorough and easy to understand overview of what happens in criminal law. In this age of blame, more law-abiding citizens spend time and money defending themselves contrary to ""innocent until proven guilty"". This is a great book to have that could help prevent an innocent person from even getting into trouble."
2,An Interesting Read,"Cavaliero's The Last of the Crusaders was first published in 1960 so it is fairly old. Nonetheless it is still an essential reading for the Hospitaller's last century on Malta. Cavaliero, naturally writing in hindsight, presents the Knights' ousting from Malta in 1798 as long overdue; this makes for good reading but bad perspective. One gets the sense this is as much an elegy for the Hospitallers on Malta as it is a historical work. To Cavaliero's benefit, though, this is a subject that has received scant attention despite the general swell in popular interest in the military orders; he is to be credited with tackling this period of history with a kind of style other historians would be envious to achieve. In summation:Get this book? Yes. It is well worth it, despite its faults."
2,Great read!!,"I wish more authors would drop away from the overdone and give us something like this! Ms. Pippin provides a few hours of escape. This is a book that will keep you rooting for the ""old girl"" right up to the very last!! Loved it!!"
2,Colorful Generic Binder Clips,"Lots of uses, fairly durable, almost as nice as a name brand product!The paint chips off a little too easily on these, which knocks off a star. Otherwise, just as functional as any other binder clip, but with the addition of COLOR!"
2,A Great Primer for all History Students,"A must read. Clearly illustrates lasting themes of history, about those who make it, yet are usually absent in our books."
2,Bios Tuning,"Most comprehensive information on tweaking any computer's BIOS.A great help in speeding Start-up time and booting to the Op system.This was a very helpful purchase. I'd recommend this to any computer user, novice or expert.Jerry"
2,Vera Lynn....Remembers,"Sound quality was excellent. The only comment I can make is about the case which arrived broken. However, the CD was in fine shape."
2,Well worth the money!,"I knew after researching and comparing that this would be a quality tripod. It exceeded my expectations for quality of construction, feel, and smoothness. The legs are very secure and solid in all positions. It is a bit heavy, but I cannot justify spending the big bucks for a composition tripod that can't work any better than this puppy."
2,Mozart for Kids,This is an excellent book on the life of Mozart for young children to read. The illustrations are great! I gave this book to each of my piano students as a gift.
2,Romantic and artful to the extreme. Nothing else like it.,"Both these artists have done excellent work elsewhere and both have had great respect for each other. This is their only collaboration, and it is a high point for both of them. Coltraine is relaxed, mellow and intellegently restrained in his phrasing. Where he is not restrained is in the depth of the emotion he puts into his playing. Nowhere is he more romantic and soulful than here. The same can be said for Hartman. His phraing is so subtle and his tone is so smooth that it is impossible not to fall in love with his sound. Mccoy Tyner backs them up on the piano with an equal amount of skill and intellegence. It is seldom that artists of this stature meet, and it is even more seldom that they work together so well. This is not a Coltraine CD or a Hartman CD or a Tyner CD. It is just a great CD, one that has no peer."
2,Very Durable,"This is a replacement for another cover that lasted me only two years before it tore.While it has not yet experienced the extremes of a Northern Westchester Counter winter,which is the reason I only rated it at four stars, my initial impression is that the material is much stronger than the more costly cover I originally purchased.I have not experienced the problem others have reported related to the wind lifting the cover. Perhaps this is because my cover is a perfect fit over the table and chairs that it protects."
2,Cute Read!,This book is a clever and sometimes thought-provoking collection of prose and poetry about the realities of teaching in today's world. It's a cute read for a teacher at the end of a long day and should be shared with colleagues!
2,JAMIE ROCKS IN THIS MOVIE!,"Jamie Leigh Curtis has come a long way in her career since HALLOWEEN. I had a VHS tape of this movie, and love the movie so much, I had to buy the DVD.Sad to say RON SILVER is no longer alive..but BLUE STEEL is probably one of his best roles. Jamie has some really nice moments with Clancy Brown. It is a good movie....buy it! TERI"
2,"The ""Nerdinator""","This is sort of a cross between ""Revenge of the Nerds"" and ""High Plains Drifter."" If you're a Clint Eastwood fan, then I think you'll like this flick. This is probably my favorite Michael Douglas movie, because he really plays a convincing role. Also good supporting cast, especially Frederick Forrest. Duvall is exceptionally fine also. Really, this movie pretty much acts out what many of us 'white middle class' males fantasize doing when we're just fed up with life in any big city."
2,Authentic Librettos of the French and German Operas,"Part of a series published in the early 20th Century, sort of a Cliff Notes for the ""big"" operas. The translations into English are handled nicely, although comparing such to translations of today might be a bit jarring."
2,EXCELLENT DETAILED EVENTS OF THE NATION'S AIRLINES.,USED AS TEXT AT EMBRY-RIDDLE AERONAUTICAL UNIVERSITY. EXCELLENT ADDITION TO ANY AVIATION LIBRARY....!!
2,As Good as it Gets,"I've had the privilege of seeing Gavin DeGraw live, and what you hear on the album is what you hear live. He is that good.I'll try to forgive the somewhat cheezy video made for ""Follow Through,"" because the song is wonderful. This guy can sing and play the piano with such abandon.Although, the first two songs may be the commercial hits, you need to hear the whole album to understand that when Gavin DeGraw croons ""Give Me your Strength,"" he's giving it his all.""Chemical Party"" is fun and cleverly written. ""Crush"" takes you back to every single crush you've ever had. ""More than That""is one of my favorites, because of the soulful intro. ""Nice to Meet You Anyway,"" is great because I love the meaning behind the song. I could go on, but I recommend that you buy this album yourself. If you are disappointed, I would be interested in knowing why."
2,"Beautiful book, strong translation and commentary","Marcia Falk's translation of The Song of Songs reproduces the Hebrew original beautifully and then translates it, using different typefaces to show the voice of the female speaker, the male speaker, and the group voice. (In Hebrew, gender is part of the language, but the English reader often has no idea--yet the Song of Songs is remarkable for its equality of attitude and action between the female and the male speakers.) Falk's commentary is insightful and helps the contemporary reader to understand this important Biblical text.'"
2,Well worth it,"My dental hygienist recommended this product to me and I checked at local stores and found it a bit expensive for my budget. Luckily I looked on Amazon and found it for a price I was more comfortable paying for something I had never tried and for which I didn't have recommendations from my friends. I'm glad I purchased it - it cleans my teeth really well, it has good power at the highest levels and more comfortable pressure at the lower levels, it's easy to maintain and doesn't take up too much space, and really enjoy having it. The only detractor would be the attachments ... in my opinion they're not really worth the fuss unless you have orthodontics, perhaps. I find that I only ever use the normal attachment. I tried the tongue-cleaning attachment once and found it not particularly helpful, so I just keep it stored away. I didn't pay any extra for the attachments, though, so I still give this product five stars."
2,"Excellent, comprehensive, clear. A real ""must"".","A well written book. Well planed and clear, in an easy way shows the wide spectrum of sauce making. A real must in every kitchen of the ""enthusiastic cook""."
2,A Pretty Good Shogun-esq Mystery Series,"These series of novels are all pretty good. I have read three of the books all on the airplane. The mystery is usually pretty good and the time period and characters are great. If you like Feudal Japanese history, these books are for you. Again, not the greatest but certainly enjoyable"
2,"Outstanding, Amazing and ENTERTAINING!!!","Phillip Rogers is an amazing songwriter/performer. He has mastered the art of storytelling through his music, and his soulful, bluesish delivery really drive the meaning.It's fun, entertaining and just plain good. When you buy this, you'll find it is addictive."
2,I'll Understand,"This CD may be a little before my time, but during the 70's, The Soul Children, as they say now, was the boom, I grew up listening to R&B and Jazz. This is definitely an old school mix. This is one that will bring back memories."
2,knife holder,The item was extremely heavy. I'm sure it was excellent quality but it was too long for my kitchen. I thought I had a place for it but when it arrived I realized it would not fit.
2,"Quality, and BIG.","I am replacing a smaller version of this that's been around for over a decade, so that alone will tell you something about the quality. This unit is quite a bit bigger, perhaps will hold 3x as much as my old one, though you still need to put a realistic amt inside for it to get decently dry. Operating the spinning does require some muscle, at least to get it up to the crazy speeds that I prefer. Don't forget to use the brake and let it fully stop before opening or lettuce will go flying!. The black rubbery texture allows for a good, solid grip too.The new design separates easily to wash the parts. Typically, I wash it by hand and air-dry, though it's been through the dishwasher many times and seems to be just fine.Nice product, well made, and should last a long time."
2,This stuff is Wonderful!,"I have used this for many dishes. I love that it is lower in sodium than most. it's only about 65mg sodium per 1/4 teaspoon. I love it on Shrimp, skewer season and grill. or saute with this and a little oil, maybe a dash of Dry white wine. also Great on sauteed, grilled, baked or boiled, Mushrooms. Wonderful on Chicken, and pork as well. also on Salmon. Mix about 2 tablespoons (or to taste) seasoning with half and half mixture of olive oil, and melted butter (1 1/2 tablespoons each) brush on both sides of salmon season at same time with a little pepper, and grill until done. I also like to top the salmon with a little onion and lemon."
2,An addictive piece of literature !,"I was sitting in a cafe in Amsterdam when I saw a fellow American reading A Prayer for Owen Meany. Having already read Garp and The Hotel New Hampshire, I felt compelled to engage my fellow American in conversation about this book with the odd sounding title. The Man, whose name I don't recall ( remember, I was in Amsterdam...) told me a friend recommended the book to him with the words "" It was the greatest book I ever read "".It was these words that came back to me as I was in search of a new book to read. I wasn't disappointed. 1 month after reading the book I am still digesting everything Irving encompassed and intertwined into this throughly enjoyable novel. I am looking forward to reading it again and my sincere thanks to my American friend in Amersterdam for the recommendation."
2,Henry/Salvadore,"This book is too cute! What a great easy read. I read the book in less than 2 hours and ran to the movie store to rent the dvd. It was a perfect combo for a lazy afternoon. I encourage everyone to read this book, it will bring a little joy into your day, week, month, or even year!"
2,Very happy with this toy,My son is 9 months old he loves the flashing colors and the music that this toy has. Right now he has a thing with closing it after he opens it he just thinks it is the funniest thing. He enjoys pressing the buttons and seeing what happens when he does. I would reccomend this toy to a friend
2,Silpruf,This product was chosen because of its excellent expansion and contraction properties. Clean up was easy. Best to use entire tube during one session - lost contents out of the side on the second day of use
2,A lovely tea,Delicate aroma and flavor and a lovely tin. Harney and Sons make excellent teas. You won't be disappointed with this tea.
2,"Knockout Kings, Fast Action, Great Game","The best Realistic type boxer around. If you enjoy a different kind of fighter now and then, try this one out, it truely sets the pace for next generation 3d boxing games."
2,"Desert Island CD, Masterful","If I had to spend a year on a desert island, I would be sure to place Patrick Cassidy's Famine Remembrance into my backpack. This music is breathtakingly beautiful. One can almost sense the anguish of the Irish people as they witnessed their loved ones dying helplessly. The score captures the suffering of this dear people and their land. Of course, one can compose works of lament that leave one lying in the gutter, defeated. No so, this recording. The two majestic Funeral Marches (introducing and ending the work) capture the dignity of what the Irish people have suffered. In other words, death does not have its final say. The De Profundis is every bit as magnificent as the best in Renaissance works or Baroque requiems. This is a very highly recommended work of genius."
2,Diced Mix Green & Red Peppers,I absolutely love the flavor of bell peppers and use them extensively in my cooking. These were good comparedto other peppers I've purchased. I do however find it more convenient for my usage to have the plasticjar container. I would recommend this company.
2,great work shoes,"very sleek, very professional looking.of course it's super comfortable- Pliners are always great on the feet.I was intially worried that the front part would be flimsy but it's not. once you have your feet in there - it looks really smooth and polished.it's great for work.... perfect heel height - so it's not too ""sexy"" for work but still give you alittle height.this is my ""safe"" shoes. Not too sexy or trendy, but also not too grandma-ish."
2,M-Dawg :Who doesn't love down south #iggas ?@Waz Up P!,Yo P your movie was the $hit! All your movies are though! Ya'll BUSTIN @ss #oes can't phase NO LIMIT! NO LIMIT FOR LIFE! PEACE!
2,Ice Road Truckers - First Season,"I had not realized this was the first season of shows. It arrived on time as ordered, however. Good seller."
2,Adam's Vocals,"Adam's voice deserves 5 stars all on its own. It's just so gorgeous. He's also a superb lyricist and his band members are also great. They do extremely well together. Acoustic or studio. These versions showcase Adam's voice without other instruments drowning him out in any way. So, if you're really into his voice like I am, this album is a sweet buy."
2,a must see,This movie was recommended by a friend. It is truly a great work. It transports you back to feudal Japan and does a great job at not sugar coating some of life's realities.
2,Simply the BEST,We purchased this ice cream maker over a year ago and have used it constantly!! We're going to purchase this machine for Christmas presents for our family this year and we're SURE everyone will love it as much as we have. We LOVE making different flavors of ice cream.
2,Excellent read! Words are turned into images...,John's first book is an example of a brilliant mind whos put his youthful memories to paper.. with amazing results. You'll feel the excitement of a young man as he explores the Phillipines. A good book to read with your child.
2,Great Live Deep Purple,"This cd is excellent!!! Steve Morse is great and Jon Lord and Ian Paice are on their best! Ian Gillan's voice is in really great shape and with the combination of all musicians being in tune this is one of the best live deep purple projects. Made in Japan is still their best! But considering all, this one with Steve Morse is great! Well worth the money! I will but the DVD!"
2,LADIES INVICTA,ARRIVED AHEAD OF TIME (LOL) (PUN)...PERFECT IN EVERY WAY...I WILL BE SURPRISING HER WITH THIS BEAUTIFUL WATCH TONIGHT...WOMEN'S INVICTA 8942 PRO DIVER GQ TWO-TONE STAINLESS STEEL WATCH.NO-DOUBT...LOTS OF HUGGING AND KISSING TONIGHT !( SHE SAID SHE LOVES IT )
2,HE made me think more of my Fiance',"I never heard this song til my baby Tanya told me about it and I decided to listen to it and I loved it from the start...Tanya in the way I could only put this song it matches everything...I'm going to buy it so that I may listen to it always to thnk of you...Brian keep up the good work you have many more years of talent to show this world, you have plenty more talent to share that will warm the hearts of others"
2,Make life easier,"Quick to install, and oh so nice for a self load. Get the Mako saddle in the front and this in the back, done."
2,Must see,I really liked this movie. I can't say I loved it because it was so depressing but it's one you want to see more than once. Unfortunately in today's world I found the movie very believable and very realistic. Will definitely add it to my movie collection.
2,Works very well for the price,"I've wanted a pair of these for awhile now. Especially for when I shop with others who usually end up not where they're supposed to be. Though promised shipment in 2 or 3 days it took more than two weeks for them to be shipped. This could have been because I used the free shipping. Otherwise, the radios have a nice distance to them. I walked more than a mile away from my house while another person sat inside. We had no problems understanding each other. The radios also are easy to figure out how to set up and use. I also like the different call sounds that can be selected. They clip nicely to ones belt or can be put into ones pocket. All in all, I should have bought a pair of these a long time ago. It was nice not having to run back and forth in stores trying to find missing shopping members this Christmas."
2,Great compilation,"Despite some of the pompous statements made in other reviews of this CD about Bocelli et al, I have to agree on the point that this is a wonderful CD."
2,Very cool -- intricate and approachable,Zome is a great step beyond knex -- at least as far as geometry and shape exploration. Very durable and well made!!!
2,guide to best thing to happen to nintendo since gamecube,Pikmin 2 well what can i say well heres one thing that everybody should know if the have played this game its FREAKIN AWESOME i love gamecube most syestems only have one great game but gamecube has 10 soon to be metroid prime 2:Echoes and this guide tells you everything you need to know about this game from where the treasureis to what pikmin you need to defeat an enime so if you have pikmin 2 and not the guide go get it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,Above average Hotwheels storage,"This case is a above average storage case, although I would like to see more spaces for typical sizes hotwheels and not the few double sized spaces that allow the cars to bounce around. It has held up wtih no damage for over a year now."
2,Post-TPLO Life Saver,"My 9-year old lab mix thinks she's quite a bit younger than she actually is and wants to go, go, go every time we head for a walk. After major knee surgery earlier this year, we needed to curb that go-power a bit. I learned about this harness on message boards and decided to purchase and give it a try. For us, it's a life saver. No longer does our dog try to pull us down the street (while risking additional injury). We are completely in control and she walks at a proper pace. Wish I knew about this many years ago!"
2,Great Childhood Memory,This book was one of my favorites when I was a child. I can still recite many of poems from memory 30 years later. I can't wait to read it to my children.
2,Bueno!,it's great for learning the language and culture. switch on the spanish subtitles and voila! i've been studying spanish for around 5 years now but i'm still a beginner. films definitely help with the process.
2,A layman's guide to police activity,"For lay people and civilians, this is a great insight into one of police work's most critical functions. As a journalist and author, I recently found myself referring to Dr. MacDonald's book (and others on forensic matters) for a very complex tale of rape and murder. His grasp of police processes and rape issues, their underpinnings and their ultimate effects is eloquently stated and well organized in this text. His experience in forensic psychiatry, supplemented by his advisory work for the Denver Police Department and consultation status for the courts, is a valuable resource. I recommend this text as a good civilian reference."
2,A Good Western With A Twist,"A woman is on the run from her father in law who blames her for killing his son, refusing to believe her tale that his son was physically abusive and she killed him in self defense. There are moments where the movie drags, but it redeems itself. I like the fact that the woman is good with a gun and knows how to take care of herself. It's not typical Sam Elliot because he plays against his usual type, but it's still a good movie with lots of good action!"
2,Lyrical and moving,"Micah's Child is a skillfully woven story of the journey of two souls, like many of our contemporaries, slogging through life trying to make the best of it until they discover each other and remember the wonder.There are brilliant swaths of prose in this book akin to that of Charles Frazier. Micah's Child is a wonderful, moving read with a tantalizing touch of mysticism."
2,Worth it.,"I like this a lot - its easy to clean, and easy to refill. Pricey, but I think its worth it."
2,Excelente película.,"La película es muy buena, sobre todo para compartirla con tus hijos, tiene un contenido que es entretenido y con valores.Tiempo de entrega muy bueno, calidad del producto muy bueno.---The film is very good, especially to share with your children, has a content that is entertaining and with values.Delivery time very good, very good product quality."
2,Snorkel Fun,For the money you cannot beat this set. I purchased a set for myself and my husband and we used them every day on a week long trip to St. John in the USVI. No complaints at all from me my husband's mask leaked a little but that has more to do with a full beard than faulty product. If you are just going to use this once or twice a year I would highly recommend them.
2,God's Got My Back,"This is a wonderful CD. It is filled with spiritual uplifting music and lyrics. This CD is enjoyable morning, noon or night. If there is ever a need to listen to inspiring music this is it. This CD is meant to be shared with family and friends.Enjoy It. Let yourself go in it. Experience a new beginning on a new spiritual plane."
2,Weird,"Weird. After I watched this movie, that's the only thing I could use to describe it. Weird, because it's a great movie, but it's really demented. It's about this boy who has cancer and con see things in this old house they move to. That seems boring, but it's not. The people who made this might be messed up in the head and need a therapist, but they know how to make a good horror movie.Don't be fooled by the ""Based on true events"" advertising. This could NOT happen in real life. I would say like 5% of it could be true."
2,What is YOUR mountain?,"I heard Jamie Clarke speak and found him to be quite fascinating and was inspired to get and read his book, ""The Power of Passion"". The book was very good but not near as good as hearing Mr. Clarke speak in person. If you ever have a chance to hear him speak, don't miss it. If not that, read his book. It's more than about climbing a mountain, it's about striving to do our best, to try our hardest in what ever we do every day. Everyone has a ""mountain"". We each need to face the challenge and strive to do our best to conquer it."
2,Jennifer Ehle is great. Who is Colin Firth?,"The visit of Mr. Collins after Lidia's elopement, was out of the flow of the story. The 1980 version has a letter coming from him (as Jane A. wrote it) which isa better rendition. The 1995 version could have been eight hours long, and be more enjoyable.I have two DVD sets and one VHS set.I also have the other versions.My preferences in order are:1995 version the best1980 version very good1940 version (we have Laurence Oliviea)2005 version (the director thinks too much ofhimself and not enough of Jane A.)"
2,GREAT DEAL!! LOTS OF PICTURES...,THIS JUST DOESN'T RUN OUT OF SPACE. I'VE HAD 65 AND IT STILL IS GOING STRONG.
2,Just Lou!,"Lou Levy has passed on since making this cd. Luckily for us, his spirit lives on in his music. His interpretations and his music must never be forgotten. To hear phenomenal piano, this cd is it!"
2,Web of Evil,I have never read any of the Jance books that aren't exceptional and I am really enjoying this new Ali Reynolds series. Having heard her speak at a book signing and meeting her last fall makes the books that much more special. What talent! If you EVER have a chance to meet her - DO!
2,Good purchase for the value paid,"I purchased this swing for my 21-month old child. We installed and used it right away. It is nice, stable and secure for the child. The only thing you might want to consider is, if this swing will be installed on a swing set, the ropes of the swing are very long. My son's feet were touching the ground so we could not use it with the original ropes. Good choise for an infant swing. Highly recommended!"
2,Fast Shipping,"I needed this DVD in a hurry for class. It was shipped promptly and in the condition promised. Also, hard video to find but was found on Amazon. I highly recommend Amazon for hard to find items. Docudrama is great teaching tool for Family Violence."
2,Funny book,"Admit It, You're Crazy! is a really funny & insightful book. Some of the quirks shared in this book, which will leave you laughing like crazy, can hit pretty close to home!"
2,Great Humidifier and Terrific Support,"This humidifier works great. It's very quiet on the low setting and empty's both tanks in about 24 hrs when set on low. It was easy to set up, as well as easy to fill. I made the mistake of dropping a tank while filling and it cracked. The warranty center replaced the tank quickly at a reasonable cost. They were easy to get hold of, their number is actually published in the manual. They were also very courteous and helpful on the phone. I would definitely recommend this model!"
2,Really Grew On Me,This is one of the few concert videos that I can watch over and over. At first I felt like something is missing but it really grew on me. There are some great songs on here.
2,Good dvd recorder,"I have use this product for a month and its very good. It comes with an ATSC Tuner so you doesn't have to buy a new TV for a few years. The recording is smooth, no noise, if you close the recording session it can be played in other dvd players. Better if you use the component cables for a nice picture quality."
2,product,"I love this soundmaker. I've ordered a couple of them. Some as gifts. It allows me to watch TV after my husband goes to bed...because he is such a light sleeper. He complained at first that it was too loud. If he would use his eyes and not his mouth and read the directions he would have seen it has a volume control on it. I didn't say anything..he hee, so I can hear the TV in the den when he goes to bed YEA!!!"
2,Everyone should read this!,Great book! I will only buy assets from now on and avoid buying liabilities. This book teaches you the principles of your money making you money vs. working for money.
2,A Comprehensive Understanding to Purchasing in the Hospitali,"This textbook succinctly outlines and dicusses purchasing processes in the hospitality industry. It is therefore essential for any nonpurchasing agent who wants a comprehensive view of the purchasing function and activities to understand the management of a successful operation. The book has a lot of useful hands-on information and would be valuable to any person who will be assuming any purchasing related activities in the hospitality industry. As one who has studied hospitality management and worked in the industry, the detailed explanations are very precise and correct and very instructive. The book is recommended for nonpurchasing agents, but I recommend it for anyone who wants to understand one of managements' biggest headaches: purchasing."
2,"Excellent camera ,highly recommended!","I was surprised to read all the negative reviews about the canon z155. My own experience with this camera has been basically positive. Since purchasing the camera 7 months ago, the majority of my prints have been sharp, clear, colors bright and true to life. The only drawback i can think of is the pictures do tend to blur when using full zoom without a tripod. I dont think this is specifically Canon's problem, though, because photography books all recommend using a tripod when using a high zoom. At 155mm, one needs a very steady hand or the pictures blur. When I do use a tripod, even my pictures at the highest zoom come out crystal clear. I'd recommend this camera anytime!"
2,Como comerciante,"El equipo es bien apetecido por mis cliente, realmente no soy usuario del mismo sino un revendedor y el producto goza de muy buena aceptacion por el publico hispano..."
2,BG ROCKS,"Blind Guardian, along with a few other bands (Iced Earth, Stratovarius, Symphony X, etc..), is the best thing that has happened to metal.Blind Guardian is amazing, buy this album, along with all of there others. A Night at the Opera is highly reccomended. And in my opinion Tales from the Twilight World is their best."
2,Awesome!,This book is awesome because you will be able to study through the whole Bible in an amount of time that does not take you too long to really spend time on each chapter. I recommend it!
2,Dr. Moh'd Radaideh's Testimonial Statement,"The book is an excellent resource of E-Business and E-Government literature. Valuable lessons can be learned from the book as it elaborates on E-Commerce initiatives and policy implications in several countries and other topics.I like the way the book is organized and find it easy to read through. The book has been organized into three sections: E-Commerce initiatives and policy implications, policy implication for networked SMEs in Supply Chain, and policy push and monitoring.Several chapters in the book elaborate on topics related to my current research projects. Reading through these chapters will be very helpful in this regard."
2,A gem too!,"This compilation cd is a gem too. Just like its counterpart Bachatahits 2005 this cd reassures merengue fans that merengue is still a force to be reckoned with. I was not sure what to expect since merengue has slowed down somewhat over the past few years but this cd reunites the best of the best of 2004 for 2005 all in one cd. The cd has a nice variety of merengue golpeito, suave and tipico. You will enjoy it. No doubt about it."
2,Come on Arnold!,"Is this the version of pumping iron I watched at my cousin's house. In that version, Arnold has a monologue about how much he likes cumming, and how weight lifting, and body building contests are like cumming, and so he's always cumming in some fashion. Then there's the version I saw in gym class, where the cumming monologue is edited out. I want to know if this one has the cumming or not. I like the cumming. It's funny to watch a young arnold with a rich, robust Austrian accent say the word cum like 7 times in a minute. I'll admit it, I'm only in it for the cumming. Terminator 3 sucked anyway."
2,Top quality binder,How many times have you been annoyed at having binder tabs extending past the edge of the binder and getting crunched? You need not suffer any more! I love this binder and will order more.
2,Give Us MORE Garrett !!,"I don't know what it is about this guy Glen Cook, but I just cannot get enough of him. Any character who claims beer is his favorite food and redheads are his favorite sport is my kind of guy. If someone told me it was possible to blend the fantasy lit world of elves and fairies with the Dectective Noir world of Raymond Chandler and Dashiell Hammett, i would laugh in their face. However, Glen Cook does exactly that. And it works. I have laughed my way through all eleven Garrett books and I can't wait for more. All I can say is I hope Mr. Cook considers taking some more time off from his job at the General Motors light duty truck plant and writing us some more Garrett. I cannot get enough."
2,Brilliant and Unique,Possible Side Effects took me to places of hilarity and heart. It is a wonderful book and yet different than Mr. Burrough's others in that it gets closer to his real life than ever. Recommended most highly.
2,2nd one was okay,"I purchased my first one of these at Costco Wholesale, but halfway through the volume wouldn't turn up or down. So I sent it back finally and I just recieved the JBL on stage package last Monday. I love it because it charges my ipod mini for me. So my advice for you is to send it back if the volume won't turn up or down. Check the website for JBL www.jbl.com click home audio."
2,Easy to use,This pump is easy to use and assemble. Also easy to clean. I do wish it came with ready to use nipples to feed direct from the bottle.
2,superb television,"You could write a review for any season of this show and it would basically repeat the same thing - this show was amazing. Some of the finest Tv ever aired. The writing was never watered down for the masses. I respected the pacing of this show. You absolutely had to pay attention to every second. This way, you became a part of the saga, not simply a viewer. The addition of Jimmy Smits and Alan Alda to the cast added yet more firepower to an already explosive cast. Quite possibly the best portrayal of a President by Martin Sheen - at least, the kind of President we all want."
2,Decent; better multifunction buttons = better,"So, this keyboard is great, but ideally the volume keys would be larger and not so readily confused with other nearby keys. Also, it would be absolutely great if the brightness knob would also function as a volume knob! Nice, quiet keystroke action, beautiful lit keys and a sleek robotic look are appropriate and appreciated. The weight of the keyboard is almost enough, but a tad more weight would aid in keeping it put in one location, especially on a messy desk!"
2,48 Days to the Work You Love Tops in My Book,"48 Days to the Work You Love goes beyond the usual variations on the same job search formula to the heart of the reason to seek a vocation, not just another job.After a recent lay-off, when I needed inspiration and motivation as well as up-to-date advice on resumes and interviews, Dan Miller's encouraging words were just what the doctor ordered.I plan to order several copies for high school and college graduation gifts and can confidently recommend 48 Days to friends and family who, for whatever reason, find themselves at career crossroads."
2,A moving and thoughtful work.,"I found that this was a very thoughtful and beautifully written book. It is very rare that I feel moved to tears by the power of a piece of fiction, but I felt deeply moved by this novel. I hope others will find it and enjoy the journey of this man's life characterized by his mysterious letters home from South Africa which serve as a chronical of it."
2,Wonderful album!!,"This album is one of my favorites of all my gospel cds (over 100). I've never heard ""Silent Night"" as beautiful and moving as this rendition. Emmanuel (not just a Christmas song), Joy to the World, and In Excelsis Deo (this song seems to be missing from Amazon's track list) are my favorites, but the entire album is great. I highly recommend this album."
2,You can't beat a paper comic book in your hands,"I love X-men, but it's a bit of a struggle trying to read it on my computer or laptop. The constant scrolling, ugh. I prefer the book series or comics, if available."
2,Good Training Potty,"We got this for our 14 month old boy and he quickly got accustomed to using this. It is very easy to clean and is low enough to be very comfortable. He grew too tall for it within six months and we had to get him to the baby potty seat, which was another training curve. I liked the product."
2,In The Beginning Was Information,Why do people believe evolution could not have worked? In a logical and scientific manner Dr. Gitt explains why he concludes evolution is not possible. If you are one who subscribes to the theory of evolution you might take the challenge of reading the book and looking for gaps in his logic. Either way you come down on the topic of evolution / creation you will be sure to learn a great deal from this book.
2,A wild book.,"The book is the story of a small group of Marines in China led by a young officer who escape through the ""back door"" just after Pearl Harbor. Brady, a former Marine officer, captures the daring of the Marines as they use their initiative under difficult and changing circumstances."
2,Buy this game,"I like this game because I like action games. I really didn't think it looked very good, but you have to try it before you judge it. Don't judge a book by its cover. The graphics aren't the best, but the rest of the game makes up for it. BUY THIS GAME!!! It's fun because you get a jet pack."
2,best chips ever,I'm obsessed with these chips but I'm not so sure about buying them in such a large quantity. If you live in NYC you can get them just about anywhere from Duane Reade to Bed Bath & Beyond on 6th ave.
2,That's My Boy,"Another funny Sandler movie. Full of funny and raunchy moments. I've always been a fan of Sandler's, and ""That's My Boy"" was a big improvement from ""Jack and Jill"", which was decent but not nearly as good. What's funnier is seeing people going to see a raunchy, dirty comedy and get butt hurt and offended as if they didn't think it wouldn't be. If you're not easily offended, not stuck in the old days where everything has to be ""good, innocent, Christian"" comedy, and have a sense of humor, you will love this movie."
2,MARVEL LEGENDS MODOK SERIES BETA RAY BILL,this was probably one of my favorite figures i picked up for my son. beta ray Bill looks really cool. if u can get one at good price jump on it.
2,it was ok,Well written and organized. I would have said I loved it the text anddiagrams seem to fall apart by the end of the book. Deadline?
2,"Sweet, beautifully illustrated story","ALL of Robert McCloskey's books are full of such lovely, fascinating illustrations and this one is no exception. My 4 year old son pores over the pictures over and over again of the small towns and the little details in each scene that make it fun to read the books again and again. Most of the stories and illustrations show every day things that kids can relate to. Lentil just arrived in the mail four days ago and we've read it every day since. Its sweet and simple and fun to read, or to just look at the drawings."
2,What you would expect from Funk.,"I saw this book for a while and finally got around to reading it. Its what you would expect from Funk. It's kind of all over the board, but it is very interesting if you are into wrestling from the 80's right up to the classic days of ECW. I saw Funk referred to as a madman in several other wrestling books and he truly does not let the reader down on this one. He has some great stories, on par with Classy Freddy Blassie's book. It holds your attention and the length is perfect. He does not get into the blood and gore that you would have expected, but he really does not need to. He gives an entertaining account of his life and really takes you into the locker room to understand the hijinks, tears, laughs, and betrayals that took place. Defintiely worht it if you are into 80's and 90's wrestling stars."
2,HORRIFYINGLY WONDERFUL!!!!,"This is the second book I have read by this author (The Taken was the first)and I liked this book even better! Excellent story, I highly highly recommend to all you fellow horror seekers out there,you wont be disappointed! Although you may have trouble sleeping...Happy Reading!"
2,Stretchy & comfortable as always,"i was afraid to get more of these because recent reviews say they are tighter than they used to be, they are not. The tag doesn't say ""100% combed cotton"" anymore, but the box does. They are made the same and feel the same to me as they always have. They are not tight like ""Life"" brand, they still have some stretch and are comfortable. I have been wearing these for years and still love them. I do wear them inside out because of the seam.but i think these may be so tight they cut off some blood flow & help cause ""secretary butt"""
2,The brothers still got it!,"The best collection of blues brothers music you can get! You'll love the songs, From the brothers to the excellent band. Great songs! AAAA++++."
2,Baby songs,"We love Baby Songs! We had the VHS tapes 20 years ago when our daughter was a toddler, and now have purchased the DVD for her toddler. Great music and watchable video for children."
2,A Tale of Two Priests,"I wish I had read this book earlier when the clergy abuse scandal was in the headlines. This ""Tale of Two Cities"" - that of God and that of man - could really have been entitled ""A Tale of Two Priests."" Jason Berry and Gerald Renner tell the story of two men of the cloth, Thomas Doyle and Marcel Maciel - one a lonely advocate for victims of sexual abuse, the other credibly charged with being a serial sexual abuser - and the surprising fate that the Catholic Church under John Paul II has reserved for them. The courageous pastor to the marginalized is himself marginalized, moved from assignment to assignment, each time farther and farther from centers of influence; the cowardly child molester receives accolade upon accolade and is all but canonized while he's still alive. Fortunately for both - and for all of us - there's a life to come with judgment.This book is well-researched and clearly written. It deserves a wide readership."
2,interesting book,"This is a good book, a little gross for some of the girls. he kind of falls apart at the end, but it is great if you like monsters"
2,"Good level for skimming, a few good insights","This book didn't draw me into slow and careful reading mode, but I found some of the insights genuinely useful. The business about links being intrinsic to the meaning of the text (as opposed to just being tacked on as references) is a case in point. Nice insight, for example, into why the early suck.com was so compelling."
2,A definite read for any dog lover!,"I highly recommend this book for anyone who has ever loved their dog. I found as I read it that it caused a fresh spark of interest for me with my own doggie. I am married and have children, but I could definetly relate to this single lady. I knew before I even finished that I would miss these two characters long after they were gone. It's a very good read."
2,Education so enjoyable!,"A great dvd package, so much beautiful cinematography and earth knowledge, you feel like an elemetary student again! Well worth the price. I don't even have a HD tv, and was blown away by the amazing footage. The Lion seal is so bad a#@ that I am now afraid of some swimming bulldog that hides under the ice.If you enjoy nature tv, than you must view this series, it will leave you amazed!"
2,Book 11,The story is still too slow in developing. Maybe the last book will finally clear up all the unanswered questions.
2,Shatters the Air,"This album is more of a work of art than any other album i've heard(and i own a lot) so far. Billy Corgan makes his whine of a vocie a great sound. It rocks, buy it."
2,Small,The booklet is smaller than I thought it would be. It is very helpful regardless and has the information needed to rebuild the rifle.
2,A tribute of honor to all American servicemen & women,"The Twins Platoon is an excellent book for anyone who wants to grasp a better understanding of how many American Vietnam Veterans experienced the trauma of war. Whether you are a veteran, an American for or against the war, the author Christy Sauro shares heart wrenching, heart warming stories of several unsung heroes. This book tells how many Vietnam Veterans not only suffered during the war but after from post trauma syndrome and how many were shabbily treated coming home.This book is about honor to all American Servicemen and women.Marie Meyer,Lake Elmo"
2,New point of view about human history,"In an economic world, we all analize economic and political facts based on materialist theories (Marxist theory of value). Fukuyama shows us a differnt way of thinking that lets us understand past, present and future events."
2,Beautiful Bead Set,"I purchased this for my niece who is 6 years old. First of all, the beads in this set are very beautiful and much better quality than other ones that I've seen online. We have made some beautiful earrings and bracelets that do not look homemade at all. It comes with all the wire and connections you would need. Note that you do need to have your own pliers and scissors. That being said, this set is not really made for kids younger than about 7 years old and you still need an adult to help out. The instructions are a little difficult to decipher and you basically have to use some common sense to make it work. Since I had no past experience in jewelry making, it did take a little effort in trying to figure out how to put the pieces together. But in the end, we made some beautiful looking jewelry. If you're looking for a kid's jewelry set, this one is definitely too advanced for them."
2,The Return of the Piano,"I had the pleasure of seeing Miss Amos perform in NYC during this Original Sinsuality tour. I was mesmerized by how immense Amos' ability was at playing the piano. At times, she would straddle the piano bench, playing the organ with one hand and the piano with the other. Truly inspiring.These albums capture Tori solo with her piano, and the improvs and intros have never been more intricate nor beautiful. Her voice has matured, becoming more husky than what she produced in the early 90's. This produces a great contast in sound, allowing for a truly cathartic listening experience as Amos goes from the gutteral to the sublime. A must have for Tori fans."
2,A New Addition to My Favorites List,I have recently discovered this work and how delighted I am that I did! This music is very appealing. How could it not stir ones very soul? I think this is the third rendition I have heard and the quality of interpretation and performance is superb. The soloists are outstanding. Only the quality of the recording is somewhat lacking.
2,Limited Species reference,The information is good..what's there. I just wish it had more plant species.
2,Haynes BMW R Manual Review,"This is the third manual I have for my BMW R65LS motorcycle.I have used Haynes manuals extensively in the past.It is a typical Haynes manual - concise, compact and easy to follow. Some might find the format a bit ""tight"" compared to a Clymer or factory manual. However all the required information is there. Electrical diagrams are in colour. Photographs and diagrams are clear - if a bit small. Instructions are easy to follow.Some may find the Haynes physically easier to use with its hard cover and more compact format than a Clymer.I prefer the Clymer for its layout and its diagrams and photographs. There are simply more of them.It is a great manual for the price. If you can afford it - get both manuals."
2,A page turner!,"I absolutly loved this book. I cried and laughed, empathized and understood.The only side note I have to add is that one of the women in this book really does a disservice to the military with her obnoxious whiney anti-war nonsense. Most women of the homefront are not like her, in my experience."
2,Best Chicken and Chipotle Soup,"Pg. 55 Our friends request this delicious meal, and it is very easy. A staple every winter in our home. We use pre-made organic chicken broth to make it even easier and grilling the organic chicken breasts give it the extra smoky taste."
2,Believable Story-Believable Dialogue,"I had reservations after the first few pages, mentions of inmates and rapists and crappers, as I was hoping to review this book for my 5th-grade class. But, Moose's tale of survival and family love and sacrifice on Alcatraz becomes a beautiful tale. The chapter ""Eye"" alone is worth reading many times. The topic of autism was masterfully handled. I haven't read Kira Kira, but I can't imagine it's any more passionate and absorbing than this wonderful read."
2,Makita 18V lithium battery,"I like the small size, low weight, and high power capicity of these batteries and the associated Makita tools. My only complaint is that some of the batteries are tight and very hard to remove from the tools. This problem tends to become worse with use. Also be careful with the charger - is works well but is VERY dellicate and will break / cease to function if dropped or banged around."
2,I love this show!,"Smart, funny..and of course sexy (duh) This show has it all...Great for women because I know you'll relate...and great for guys, because hey! women are just like us!They just shop more..."
2,the veltones,"I thought the album was pretty good but i had a hard time listen-ing to hear the drums in most of the songs. The drummer was ex-cellent but you cannot hear the drums very good because the saxplayer is playing louder over all the other instruments and drow-ning them out, including the drummer. I'd also like to say thatthe sax player throughout the album came up short on alot of thesongs-like he was playing with a ""FIRESTONE"" saxaphone that had major blowouts with alot of flats. That's my opinion, his notes were flat on most of the tunes. Other than that, the album was a good swing jazz CD."
2,Livingstone's Review,"A practical book written in a good style to be found useful by both beginners and advanced users. The concepts of practical DSP with focus on applications to communications are well explained.Some of the algorithms, like in DSP based Modems, would be found immensely useful to both academic and practicing engineers."
2,More Birding by Ear,"If you love listening to birdsong, this sequel to Birding by Ear is a must. First, I loved the first CD, Birding by Ear. The narrator takes you through many common birdsongs and gives you a handle on how to remember the song. I can now, for example, hear a Broadwinged Hawk before I ever see it; that is just one example of the skill one can obtain from listening to Birding by Ear. More Birding By Ear goes one step further than the first series; it gives you songs of coveted species of birds - birds such as Henslow's Sparrows, Northern and Louisiana Waterthrushes, Black and Yellow Rails - birds that are harder to find, elusive, or a challenge when making a visual ID. The narrator is superb - clear, concise, easy to remember; he makes what could be difficult simple. I simply love this CD - it is an indespensible tool!"
2,Classic,"Dilbert is absolutely fantastic and its obscurity is criminal. It's full of hilarious quotes and storylines. It's so dense with jokes, you always find something you missed when you rewatch the series. And you'll do plenty of rewatching if you're anything like me. For anyone unfamiliar with the series, do yourself a favor and watch ""The Knack"" on Hulu. Depending on when you read this review, that particular episode may or may not be available at the moment, but I would argue that it's the best to watch if you get a chance.If you've done that, you've most likely clicked the 'add to cart' button by now.There are two full seasons in the collection, with few special features. Honestly, it doesn't matter. Maybe it would be a tough sell if this show were still on the air and this collection were full price, but as it is, you can't pass it up."
2,"Works great, only a few drawbacks.","I really like this product. It works great, just like it's supposed to. There are a few things I think could improve the product. The materials aren't very sturdy, so you have to be careful when leaning/resting another container against it to empty (i.e. lawn mower bag). The top opening could be bigger to allow easier dumping of a ""rake-full"" of debris. Also I've already lost one of the clips that holds the bag in place. I wish it came with a few extra. Oh well, I still like it. It has made yard work easier for me. I LOVE the fact that I can roll the bag around the yard with me then roll it to the front curb. I would recommend it to others."
2,immense in every aspect,"When i saw this trail of dead album in the shop, i hated the front cover but i knew the band is good. this was just before they release another morning stoner. Call me shallow but i didn't want to buy it cause of the ... front cover. but i some how got past that and brought it. that was a great decision because it's now one of my favirite albums. The song ""Half of What"" is the best on the album by far. these guys rock don't let me down by not buying this immense album!"
2,"""Without name""","Eddie Santiago one of the best puertoricans salseros.Oro salsero is one of those cd's that you can't say i'll get it later,it's simple a precious jewel in every salsero colletion."
2,Home territories,I received the book very soon and I am very happy with it. It is in perfect conditions and I'm so glad with the content.
2,Excellent.,"I love to teach myself. I started out with Charlie Papazian's book. That book was very helpful and pointed out a few things I might not have instantly associated. After my first 5-gallon batch I had more questions about the process as I was looking for finer details on the different stages. The Papazian book is definitely an excellent resource.When I got the Korzonas book I thought ""Here I go just doubling up and not expanding."" How wrong I was. It expands on the basics to an intermediate level. There is definitely a wealth of information in this book.I can't wait to see what Volume II will be like.I will say these last things and let you on your way.Armed with only 4 things you will always brew excellent beer.1) The Complete Joy of Homebrewing (Charlie Papazian)2) Homebrewing Volume I (Al Korzonas)3) Informative local Homebrew shop or Homebrew Club.4) Love of good beer!!Remember C. Papazian's beautiful mantra ""Relax don't worry, have a homebrew."""
2,Great but why did they stop making it!!!,This is the best cleanser I have ever used but WHY did Nivea stop making it and why is this seller selling it for an outrageous mark up. I use to pay $6.00/tube for it.
2,"informative, enjoyable real life people.","this book is so informative concerning the lives of the orthodox jewish people living in brooklyn ny. i thought i knew pretty much about the everyday living, but ms.goodman really explains how the Rav controls their lives. hope she continues with the same people and tells more about their lives."
2,the fencing master,"Perez achieves the near unachievable--contemporary writing, depth of understanding, universal archetypes--a page-turner for literaria. If you enjoy wit, a literate style, pace accompanied by depth, don't miss Perez's books. This may well be he least enjoyed by American audiences, but having lived in Spain for some time, the insights to the Spanish psyche, I believe, are the most astute and revealing in, ""The Fencing Master."" I have enjoyed all of his books--but this one the most so far."
2,Make your student life easy and read this.,The people who wrote this are involved in learning and teaching foreign languages in the way a small child learns its mother tongue and they decided to apply the same method to Fourier mathematics up to and including the Fourier Transform. This organic-evolutionary method works wonderfully and this book is to be very highly recommended to anyone intending to study this subject.I wish I had something like this when I was labouring through Fourier maths over two decades ago! It really cracks the nut of the concept of the whole thing. It is also useful to people who have been through Fourier maths but want to firm up their fragile knowledge of it or any of the more fundamental maths underlying it.Lecturers should read this too for pedagogic reasons.
2,Two Highways,This movie is a timeless classic. Jessica Rabbit is still one of the hottest actress in cinama to this day. Excluding Alyson Hannigan and Linda Cardellini. Christopher Lloyde shows he has true gritt.
2,guilty pleasure....A+,"what more i could say....i stumble into the title in this site...and i took a gamble...most of us know the story, hoping and praying that is good as the reviews....but then, magic! starts slowly, yes is one those things...but for character development!!! studying both annabelle and Simone...and their respective paths...and how both find love in the most onorthodox and inexplicable way...it's not the grossing lesbian explotation film...so guys a token of advise, it's a lesbian movie made by a lesbian for lesbians!!! if you want soft-porn go to that section...if you want candlelights and a romantic movie that takes you to the soul of the heart, then this is your movie!!!!"
2,It looked brand new,It's in really good condition. No writing or markings inside which is a plus. The first book to arrive.
2,Suspense to the tenth power!,I never wanted the storyline to end. Ms. Due has to keep the bloodline going.
2,Great battery!,I have the coolpix 5700 and use this battery - it charges up pretty quickly (seems to be under an hour) and lasts a good long time. We just got back from a trip to Turkey & Greece and I took this camera and two battteries along. Took lots of pictures - battery seemed to last a good day or so between charges.
2,Great Pan,Awesome to cook in and clean up is a breeze. Remember to follow the instructions to keep the heat on Medium and close the lid. I have even cooked rice in this and it has come out great!! Highly recommend this pan.
2,"Arthur, He Does As He Pleases.....","This movie is terrific! Highly recommended. On reason why it got 4 stars instead of 5, is because the DVD is in Full-Screen, not Wide-Screen."
2,Good-bye Debt,"A great challenge to learn how we can make our money work for us instead of against us. From a woman and her family who climbed out of $100,000 of credit card debt by paying it off instead of declaring bankruptcy."
2,Great...EXCEPT SORRY,"Okay, a great CD. I have all 4 other Smash Mouth CD's. Sorry is a horrible, sick, twisted, stupid, dumb, lousy, just plain BAD, song. They shouldn't have done that. But it is still a good CD which is worth your money. Oh, and Sorry is probably the only reason it has parental advisory on it. Fush Yu Mang is still the best album, but this has some different versions of those songs, so defanitely buy this CD if you like Smash Mouth at all."
2,Highly Entertaining,"When I think of King I think of horror and having personally had my fill of the horror genre phase I never even considered the series. However, when I saw they made a movie based on the novel and it starred Tom Hanks I took a second look. Like The Shawshank Redemption it was a prison novel. I happened to find The Shawshank Redemption an excellent movie - too bad it only did $28 million in theatres because it's one of the best movies ever made. King does an excellent job of taking you back to the Depression Era and I couldn't help but see Tom Hanks as the lead throughout the book. It's an entertaining story and hard to put down and King introduces some thought-provoking concepts however - they're not life-changing. It's a good read but not a novel I feel compelled to re-read."
2,Interesting,"This is a very interesting book that has also been made into a movie. It is narrated from various points of views and through flashbacks, and is, in fact, a play.At the center of the play is Father Rivard, a Catholic priest in a small town. He feels rather depressed here, that is, until Sister Rita arrives at the parish. A love affair ensues, and is kept secret, since both priests and nuns are supposed to be celibate.But the secret slowly comes out when Sister Rita is murdered. Mrs. Shandig is Father Rivard's housekeeper, and is an important character in the plot, for only she knows how Sister Rita was murdered.This play had a totally surprising ending."
2,excellent value,This was an excellent value for dual split king size sheets and I would purchase them again! The twin XL sheets fit perfectly with room to spare. They are very soft and comfortable.
2,Holy Cowboys!!,"What a great DVD! Cowboys, Indians, a pretty girl, gunslingers, Buffalo Bill Cody, and man's best friend, this really takes me back. 15 action packed chapters with exciting cliff hanger endings. (I sure hope the good guys win in the end)! 5 stars for good old fashion entertainment."
2,My baby thanks you,"Thank you CC Couch, Gloria Nissenson & Teddy Irwin for the beautiful songs that put my baby to sleep with a smile.The music is so gentle and lovely, the words are so positive and uplifting, that even I, as the parent, love to hear the songs over and over again.CC, your voice is magical.If my baby could speak, he would say thank you."
2,Great Value,"This item is a tremendous value compared to it's manual and gas powered counterparts. While I have not used it yet for trenching, the Edge Hog preformed edging tasks at the drive and sidewalk with ease. I would certainly buy again."
2,Classic and helpful,I needed this book for an Asian history class I took last summer and then again in a Chinese Literature class. It's a book that professors tend to enjoy teaching. It's a good read and gives details about the May Fourth Movement. I enjoyed it and glad it's part of my book collection.
2,A Character You Can Care About,"In Lost and Found Darcy deals with problems that many teenagers face - friends, school, younger sisters, single working mom. But she also has the added burden of living with and caring for a grandmother she loves who is suffering from dementia. She must handle her anger and hurt regarding a father that left the family five years before. Then, there's the stalker who shows up in unusual places. Is he the one who left the threatening note?I jumped right into this story and worried about how Darcy would survive all of these problems. The obstacles were realistic, as were the solutions, which didn't come quickly or easily.I think this book is a wonderful read for its intended audience - teens who want a quick read that they can get lost in.I received this book in a giveaway from the Goodread's First Reads program."
2,Mindblowing pagan metal...,"This is quite some mindblowing stuff concidering that 'Spirit' is actually Eluveitie's debut album... The quality of their EP of 2004 was OK, the songs were good, and now with 'Spirit' they are perfected... Violins, accordions, fluits, whistles, bagpipes (or whatever) give their very recognizable and distinct sound to the rough metal Eluveitie makes... Eluveitie means 'I am an Helvetian', a continental Celt... Some songs are sung in Celtic, others in English... All are about Celtic culture and wars...I love Chrigels voice! His clean vocals and his screams are both awesome...You've got to hear this band playing live! It's a party every time I see them...This is one great band and this is definately one of the best releases I know of..."
2,Buy the book skip hiring the expensive consultants,"There is so much about the Internet, and how everyone is making/loosing on the Internet. This book clears all of the clutter with real life examples, and has allowed me to develop a strategy that expands my business, not just opens my checkbook!The book balances technical and organizational needs into a clear methodological framework of business strategies that I am using in the real world. Helping me understand the relevance of technology as not only the way to change the business, but using technology to build brand, market and service strategies.I really liked the books scorecard approach that assisted me in the implementation of my Internet strategy.I think that the book is a good book for the professional to help focus their Internet strategies, and someone just starting to look at developing an Internet plan."
2,GRRRREAT!,JESSE HAS A WAY WITH WORDS. IT IS SOMETHING ABOUT HIS VOICE. HE IS JUST EVERY WOMAN'S DREAM MAN. HE JUST HAS A CERTAIN SOMETHING THAT ALL THE OTHER MALE ARTISTS SEEM TO LACK. EMOTION. MOST MALE ARTISTS ARE WRITING SONGS ABOUT HOW TO GET THE NA NA FROM THE GIRLS. I REALLY LIKE JESSE AND HIS SONGS. HE COULD HAVE GOTTEN ANOTHER ALBUM TITLE THOUGH. PEOPLE NEED TO STOP JOCKING MASTER P'S STYLE.
2,Tweezerman can't hold a candle to Aero Tweeze!,"As an aesthetician I can give my wholehearted approval to these tweezers. I've tried Mehaz, Tweezerman, Toolworx, and just about every German-made tweezers out there and these are far and away the best. Take good care of them with the enclosed case and they will take good care of you ;)"
2,Ms. MacInnis' Third Grade Class,"The story is about a basket, boy and his grandfather. The basket was used for many things. We liked when the young boy told his father to return the basket. We learned that everytone should be respectful and nice to older people."
2,Even better than #1!,"The second series is even better than the first. Darker, yes, but the actors pull it off, especially Aidan Turner as Mitchell. Loved the ""extras""."
2,An Amazing Book!!,"This book was so amazing!! It grabbed you right in the beginning. A young girl growing up in the horror of the Holocaust and how that affected her whole life. I couldn't put the book down and the ending hit made me cry for hours. After finishing the book, I couldn't stop thinking about Betty and her struggle. As children, we all read Anne Frank's diary and we saw the horror of the Holocaust and how it ended a young life. In Betty's book, we see how the Holocaust changed her life forever. My main thought while reading the book was how different her life would have been had she been born at a time of peace. I recommend this book to everyone."
2,"Works great, so they must have fixed the problems...","I hesitated to buy this router b/c of a some negative reviews early in the product's release. But, the reviews from teh other companies' products were even worse! I have always used Linksys routers, so I decided to stay with them, and I am glad I did. The setup was the easiest ever for a wireless router, and I was set up in about 5 minutes and playing online on my PS3. I'm not a big computer nerd, so I don't know about speeds, etc, but I have never had a problem speedwise w/ the PS3 or my laptop. Would definitely recommend this router."
2,Love this movie!,"This movie was a thousand times better than the first one. It remains true to the story line in the book in ways the first one did not. My one complaint is with Amazon and not the movie. Why in the world would I pre-order a movie months in advance and then still wait another week to receive the movie! I could have gone to Target on the day of release and bought the 3 disc special edition. Instead, as a loyal Amazon customer I pre-ordered WAY in advance and yet here I am still waiting for my movie to be delivered. Very, very disappointed. What is the advantage of pre-order?"
2,3M Littmann Snap Tight Soft-Sealing Eartips-Gray,They did fit my stethoscope and work well. I had lost one of the original ear pieces! I would order again.
2,Hasbro keeps the collectors happy!,"You can say this for Hasbro: they sure know how to keep collectors happy. So what if they keep repackaging/repainting older Batman/Robin/Nightwing/Batgirl figures; the payoff is the exclusive figures you will never get anywhere else. Past box sets have included: Alfred, Commissioner Gordon, Batgirl (in her correctly colored costume), R'as Al Ghul, Talia, etc, and now the Ventriloquist and Scarface! Just the fact that they made these figures speaks volumes about how far Hasbro is willing to go to please collectors. The shame is that they have lost the Batman/Superman license as of December 31st, and Mattel will now own these rights. Let's see how far Mattel is willing to go in producing lesser known figures, and/or Batman's rogue gallery. And paint schemes or older versus newer is just nit-picking. Be happy you got the figure."
2,The price was right,"I cannot speak to the technical virtues of the card, but Amazon was the low price winner and I looked all over the web. incidentally, I use it for a Fujifilm E550, not a Olympus. My previous camera was an early digital Olympus and I found the pictures distorted. Don't know if it was the Camedia's lens or the paltry 2.1 pixels. In any case, the new Fuji is an enormous improvement."
2,Good Diversion.,"I'm enjoying this book and find it a good diversion in my long list of books that help me learn Spanish without getting bored...I don't think it's very funny, but I find it helpful."
2,Photoshop 5.0 by Ben Willmore is a must read book.,"After much debate at a local bookstore I finally desided to buy this book, based largely on the chapter dealing with text effects. Soon after reading it while in Photoshop I soon discovered that I was reading a fantastic book. Very presice in its explanations and very to the point without what Ben calls ""Techno Mumbo Jumbo"". While reading any book I often ""tab"" important pages, I had to stop doing that with this book, I found myself tabing every page!!!. If you are a novice at Photoshop like I was, buy this book it is worth its weight in GOLD. I just wish Ben would now do a book on version 5.5.Scott R. Hirschman"
2,If you like dark movies you'll like this one,"Just a bit silly at times and you'll likely have to watch it more then once....But , all in all I enjoyed it. some times too much detail and background history, and other times you wonder whats going on.I like the old ""graphic novels"" and movies that are made from them , like Sin City. While this one is not as good in my opinion as Sin City, its still entertaining and well worth the 3 hours to watch.A bit gory and violent so not really sutible for young ones, but if your looking for something a little different... Enjoy."
2,It works.,"It works. It prevents rust, it is great on table saws and inside steel bike tubes. It does what it says - what more can you ask for?"
2,Outstanding Quality,I purchased a few guitars for my grandchildren and needed to relpace the cords that came with them. The PYLE PP11-15 Was just what the Dr. ordered. I susposedd the Monster cable is a better cord but for what the kids are going to use it fot it's a SOLID 5 in my book. So far I have't been disapointed by any thing I receved from amazon.
2,Star Trek Fan,"Nice collection. I know they had to limit it, but there were one or two that I wished were here. But considering the vast amount of material to choose from, this is a great collection and well worth the price! If you can't afford all the shows from all the series, this is the one DVD to own."
2,Machinations of Madness,"Commandant Hoess' testimonial work is a poignant example of an utterlysociopathic personality, shrouded in a veil of narcissistically baseddenial. The ""family man"" who spends his work day conjuring-up new andinovative means in the pursuit of the mass-murder of over a million humansouls. The ""good soldier"" who will blindly follow the fascist doctrine ofhis Hitlerian superiors and take pride in his ability to impress them with the butcher's bill of his murder machine. Truly, his story is a good insight into a worse case scenario of ""the nobody"" who ascends to a position of power within the parameters of a police State that will allow any excess and rationalize any atrocity in its never-ending pursuit of self justification. It could happen here, it could happen anywhere."
2,Good Cube,"I have always wanted to learn how to complete a Rubik's cube and decided to get this cube to start with. I did not know there were other options at the time that may be better as you get faster at completing but either way it doesn't really matter.This cube is great. It is not a speed cube, so it is not designed to move seemliness and fast as a DIY cube or a specially made cube. That being said it does have the benefit of being durable and standard. It is a great learning cube but if you want something faster for speed cubing DO NOT get this one even the website tells you not to get it if you are trying for speed. They have other options which are great as well.One downside to almost all cubes though is that the stickers always seem to curl up after awhile. They have a few, however, that have fixed plastic insets."
2,St. Louis Arsenal: Armory of the West,Mr. McGuire has really done his homework. His book is well written and informative. I would recommend it to any Civil War researcher. This book answered several question I had about Civil War weapons and the layout of the Arsenal.
2,Love this movie!,"We love this movie. We ordered this because we loaned our first copy of this movie to a friend who, kind of understandably I guess, never returned it. We had to get another copy because we couldn't just let it go."
2,Awesome but reject the shamanism,"I love Peter Kater and most of his music without occult or shaman titles in them, because the truth is, it is part of a cult thinking and spiritual darkness. I studied it for years as I did other cults and I know people firsthand who were involved with the illuminated cult and ""ism. Otherwise he has an excellent talent and beautiful spirit in music and melodic creation on the piano and you cannot deny that he has a God-given gift, if and when he ever acknowledges that is truly where it comes from. erniem1970@comcast.net"
2,A Classic - Our Family's Favorite,"I have dozens of cookbooks on the shelf, but this is the one that comes out most often. Our favorites are the Cajun Shepherd's Pie, the shrimp etouffe, and the brabant potatoes. As another review said, follow the recipe's exactly, even if you're an experienced cook, and you will be pleased with the result."
2,Good upgrade for old desktop,"Good way to get an old desktop with Windows XP onto the home Wi fi network. Don't need to have the wireless modem physically near the desktop and use an ethernet cable to connect the two. Our old desktop doesn't get used that often - but when we do need to use it, the wireless connection is handy.Minor issues:Each time the device is plugged in the device seems to connect and disconnect a couple of times to the network before finally settling into a stable connection. Seems to happen within a few seconds and is not a big deal.Form factor: slightly bigger than a USB Zip drive - sticks out just a little bit more."
2,Wisdom of The Ages,"A great book of common sense and financial wisdom. After I started to read this book, I couldn't put it down. It made me realize all of the financial mistakes and un-wise choices that I had made through the years. It help give me the strenght to believe that their is a light at the end of the dark tunnel of debt and that I could get out into the light of debt-freeness. I am now well on my way to being debt-free and this book helped give me the inspiration to tackie that great task.I very much recommend this book for anybody that needs inspiration to get out of debt and wants to pursue a better life."
2,Amazing Results,"I had a baby 1 year ago and wanted to get back into shape. I read this book and decided to give it my all. If you want results you have to commit to getting results. I am so happy I ordered this book. I have had a couple people at the gym ask me if I'm a personal trainer and where I learned to weight train. The exercises are very clear in this book . He describes how to do them perfectly. Also he gives you a day by day regimen tells you the exercises and the page number where you can find the description. First 2 weeks are the same for everybody (except woman/man) and then he tailors the exercises to your body type...Meso, ecto, endo . If you are looking for a no nonsense book..this is it!"
2,Even More Amazing than the Huntington Gardens,"This is a man's true odyssey, making Ulysses look short on imagination. Mr. Cabot along with some of the most talented and imaginative landscapers around turned his place into a true dream of beautiful garden after garden. But his personality and what he loves really comes through. Lots of imagination went into different alles and infinite dream-like entries and exits. He worked with all the best people. Hobhouse is one of my favorites not to mention a few others. I could be very jealous but I am simply thrilled to be able to read it. It is long and full of superb photos and good writing. Makes other books that I love seem not quite as fabulous. Some of Cabot's friends look as though they would be a lot of fun at a cocktail party. Makes me want to buy a lot more land and keep going with determination to create a real series of outdoor Valhalas from France, Italy and England. Bravo, Mr. Cabot and all who helped!"
2,A Cold War Comedy Classic,"This is an ""era movie"", complete with the necessary visual cliches (spy taking spy pictures from between the legs of a statue, our spies meeting their spies on bridges to exchange things) and verbal cliches (""there are Russian missiles 90 miles off the coast of Florida!"", ""on a need to know basis"").Matthau and Glenda Jackson work a special chemistry as old CIA operatives shacking up (""do you like antiques?""), conspiring to reveal Agency secrets (""the cigar bomb sent to Castro"", etc.)And the bonus is lovely Salzburg scenery, spiced with lots of Mozart.Please, PLEASE re-release this video, on DVD!"
2,1000 Stars!! LOL!,"I actually don't think it gets any better than this!Ruben shines on both of these songs. Flying WithoutWings used to be my favorite. I use to play it overand over again it was ssssoooooo beautiful! But then...I listened to Super Star and it's been playing ever since. LOL!Wonderful talent! Beautiful voice. I can't wait untilthe album. Ruben deserved to win. Buy his CD,you won't be disappointed. :-)"
2,Very amusing..,Simple funny costume that was definatly a hit!.. Lightweight and can wear clothes under it easily. Seemed a little smaller then I thought when I read the sizing though.
2,A new series,"Given the current world events, the plot line is certainly topical.I like W.E.B. Griffin's storytelling, but I get distracted when there are typos or when he makes mistakes, especially with aviation terminology."
2,So much power in such a simple technique,"October 2012: After sitting on my shelf for about ten years, I used Katie's book the first time. I could have saved myself ten years of pain! ""The Work"" had a sudden impact on my life. I worked through deep-seated, controlling beliefs in a matter of hours, accomplishing what I didn't accomplish in over 20 years of meditation.February, 2013: I've read many hundreds of books on spirituality and awakening in my 60+ years and rank this book in the top five in terms of getting results. This is truly a spiritual workbook, one that brings results."
2,great,I gave it to my 4 month old granddaughter for Christmas. Her 2 year old sister and 1 year old cousin immediately requested it to be reas to them over and over.
2,RAWKS,This is a great video. It has live shows from around the world. And in after each song there's cheezy skit or Bugg superstar footage or Q&A with fans and other neat stuff from the band. Great live acoustic version of Mayonaise BUY IT !!!!!!!! END
2,See that clothing fly off!!,"Zapped!, well what can I say. You have to take this movie very lightly and just sit back and enjoy. Sure it's corny, but sometimes, no, most times, you just need to put your brain on hold and just wallow in cheesiness. Scott Baio is pretty impressive as the high school nerd who gains psychic powers. Every boys dreams are fulfilled as he lets loose his powers on school bullies and strips girls at his school, which is handy if the prom queen happens to be Heather Thomas. Speaking of which, yes he strips,splits, and tears at her clothing enough to sustain any guy's interest and during the prom, you just know that her pretty dress is going to end up in pieces. Buy it now and keep the magic alive."
2,Also read The State of Humanity by Julian Lincoln Simon,"Available from amazon.com is this amazing book.It gives some true data regarding the state of the planet. In some cases it slays the doomsayers, but the message is clear:Humanity can change the state of the planet for better or for worse.When you act change it for the better."
2,none,"A classic of Nature Cure literature,both beautiful andintriguing.And finally a book that does justice to our Heroes!"
2,"A Fun, Addictive, Easy Game",Pikmin. This game is a nintendo classic. Pure genius and quite original. You basicly build an army kill things to build a bigger army to help you get the parts back for your broken ship.Watch out though cause time is of the essence. The animation and graphics are beautiful and the gmaeplay is easy for even the newest gamer.This is quite the game.
2,MC never sounded better!,"This 1992 performance from the MTV Unplugged series features one of the first live performances from SuperDiva, Mariah Carey. Mariah and her backup singers and musicians never sounded better during this performance. From her first smash, ""Vision of Love,"" to her inspirational hit, ""Make It Happen,"" to her #1 remake of the Jackson 5 classic, ""I'll Be There (featuring SC's own Trey Lorenz),"" this oldie but goodie DVD is entertaining from start to finish!"
2,Hooked on the Bridgerton Family Series,"I started the Bridgerton Family Series out of order but it didn't seem to matter. Each book stands on it's own, but made me want to read the entire series. I started with the Viscount Who Loved Me. It is funny and sweet. I feel like the Bridgertons and the entire ""ton"" are my frieds and family and I just can't wait to find out how life turns out for all of them."
2,Mom of Triplets,My boys love this truck. They are hard on equipment and the Tonka name always comes through in the quality dept. It's great for that pretend work site boys get into.
2,square foot gardening,"Makes perfect sense to me. Well written with specific instructions and helpful illustrations. Waiting for drier and warmer weather to set up our first 2 tier 4'x8' box (purchased from Charley's Greenhouse, Mount Vernon, Washington)."
2,Excellent reference,"This is a well written, informative manual on just how to avoid nearly every imaginable type of communicable disease, whether at home or while traveling. The book provides useful, practicable advice on specific steps to prevent becoming infected, and the best treatment options if one has become infected. Highly recommended, particularly for international travelers."
2,A 1986 folk rock wonder.,"Violent Femmes began their career known as the band that is best at mixing folk, rock, and really weird, if not creepy, lyrics. The Blind Leading The Naked, VF's 3rd album, definitely follows in that tradition with songs such as ""No Killing"" and the ever-famous ""Old Mother Reagan"". I recommend it to all - to dance to, to listen to, to scare your parents with..."
2,Alexander fans will not be disappointed,"Some people like to complain that Lloyd Alexander writes the same story over and over again under different guises. My response: so does the rest of the world. At least Mr. Alexander does a great job of it.Known for exploring worldwide folklore, Alexander takes to the world of India for this. He explores mystical gods and makes a wonderful and powerful social commentary on the caste system.It's the usual journey of growth and discovery, but that is always a great journey. I cry every time I read this, it touches me so.Excellent piece from the awesome Lloyd Alexander."
2,Good but not great,"Nothing very special about these headphones, but for this price, its the best out there. If you are an audiophile, there are better models for $20-30 more. About these phones - great fit, great comfort, good sound. As I said, best in its class for this price."
2,I love Denzel,One of my favorite actors. I could sure see the future being like this IF there ever is a war
2,Unique+Different Sound,"It has the slightest hint of sexy edge beneath all the poppiness, or maybe I'm just reading into it too much. But anyway, awesome CD."
2,Works as advertised,"Bought it to heat up my toddler's room as he hates the idea of blankets -- and the budget can't stand the idea of heating the entire house to fulfill his desire to sleep blanket-less. While the Chicago-area fall has been relatively mild, even on nights into the 30's, the minimum setting using the ""comfort"" control has worked brilliantly.While the heat's not immediate, this is a function of the type of heater -- radiant heat, not the fault of the unit. I'd rather have a radiant heat unit, than risk having my son stick something into a fan unit.Net net, my son's no longer cold. The budget's happy that I'm not heating the entire house to ridiculous levels. Therefore, I'm very pleased that I bought it."
2,Good,i started using this the same time i started to use alba acnedote face and body scrub so i dont know if my sudden break outs were caused somewhat by this or just all by the acnedote. I will say that my skin does not feel dry at all at the end of the day. It gives it a healthy glow as welland it is also very light.
2,Wonderful Christmas music!,"Having bought his other CDs, I finally purchased the Christmas one. As a general rule, I am not fond at all of Christmas music put out by ""popular"" artists. However, from the day I received this, I have had it in my car's CD player, and I listen to it constantly. I am not even a fan of much piano music! but his arrangements are so beautiful, I had to make an exception."
2,"Nice, solid stand","The item I received looks a lot heftier than what's in the picture - did they send me the right part? Anyway, it's a very nice, sturdy stand and for the price, I can't imagine anything better."
2,Classic mid-80s country-punk,"I first heard Meat Puppets II in a grotty little used record shop in 1985. Intrigued, I bought it immediately and went on to become a huge Meat Puppets fan. The Puppets blew away any vestiges of punk-rock dogma that then remained with their acid-drenched cowpunk soundscapes. Kurt Cobain obviously knew a good thing when he heard it, and covered two songs from this record on Nirvana's MTV Unplugged show. Recent similar acts like the Supersuckers and Rev. Horton Heat sound mediocre when compared with the inventiveness and originality of the Puppets. Buy this album and time-warp back to an era when the word ""alternative"" really represented something other than a trendy radio format & marketing niche."
2,"funny,and great music","most comedy albums to me are a one time listen,but Ray Stevens knows music and puts together a good song with his great sense of humor.I love listening to this cd.some really great stuff,Bridget the midget,Gitarzan,all of it from the first song to the last."
2,Very empowering. Too bad there are only 5 stars to rate it.,"I totally agree with the reader from Tujunga, Ca. I have read it three times and each time I found more than I thought possible. I also have began purchasing this book for birthdays. If only the entire earth could read it there would not be gangs and wars. Thank you Darryl mily@ubtanet.com (Emily)"
2,"Nice, simple to use humidifier",Easy humidity. Add distilled water and stick in humidor.Here is a trick: Punch out the clear part of the lid and screw the ring on.
2,Excelente,"Todo muy bien. Me gusto... Fue lo que pedi... llego a tiempo... Excelente, recomendando 100%...Saludos desde Valencia - Venezuela..."
2,Wicket fast and incredibly quiet,"I have owned several Dymo label writers over the years. This one is such an improvement. It is quick, smooth and quiet. I love the fact I can print a stamp anytime. The best part is that I never wait in the long holiday lines at the post office again."
2,Did the job . . .,". . . on an old drummer's throne that I use as a portable guitar player's stool. (An old folkie, me.) A long-overdue replacement for three slit tennis-balls."
2,Track Listing,Song titles are:STAND UPREMINDERSMAKE IT WITH THE BLUESIF YOU STILL WANT A FOOL AROUNDSHOE STRINGTHANK YOU NADINEWORN OUT SHOELOVE IS GOIN' ROUNDDOCTOR'S ORDERSWHATEVER GETS YOU THROUGH THE NIGHT
2,The best,"I use all of the Afterburner labels and no other labels will do! These things are great! I don't even use the labeler thingey. In daylight, I just put the CD/DVD in its case and eyeball it at the center hole. Any bubbles that happen are easy to press out. The only problem I've had is that the printer ink doesn't adhere to the metallic labels as well as the matte or glossy labels; the print can be accidentally rubbed or scraped off."
2,Plenty of product,"Not only did it come with the silicone case + elastic arm band, it also came w/ a screen cleaner and protector. This was a surprise and sure added to the great value."
2,"Fun, but other toys and balls can get stuck","My 11 month old daughter received this as a Christmas gift and loves it. The biggest negative is that balls of a similar size but tad bigger from older Fisher Price toys fit in the ball popper, but once in can not get out without taking the toy apart. So be careful of what the kids put in the toy. Also the balls do fly everywhere, but that is where an older sibling comes in handy. My five year old tracks down all the balls for his sister and helps her with the start button. It is a toy that can occupy both children simultaneously."
2,I can't fight this feeling--that this book is hilarious!,"A fabulous, hilarious gift for anyone who ever lived through the cheesy love songs of the 70s and 80s."
2,Someone recommended this book,"Not having much time for reading books, I picked this up on CD. At times the book drones on about something which I found it fairly easy to tune out. Some of the details I found very interesting ... but suffice to say that on no subject did I find myself needing to reference to another place for more information (save where to find food locally).Overall, the message was pretty interesting and my wife and I changed many of our eating habits. I also now tend to avoid anything with ""high fructose corn syrup""."
2,Spectacular!,"'His Name Is Alive' continue to facinate me with their honest and beautiful songwriting - there is no pretense here, and each song is sung from the heart. This is a soulful R&B album that is modern, and somehow timeless, at the same instant - the songs are beautiful and the production is a little more loose than on their previous album ""Someday"". This is one that will be played over and over!"
2,A good book - great price!,Henriette runs away from home beacause her evil father wants her to marry this creepy Reverend Cecil Thwacker. Henriette goes to London to stay with her aunt where she meets Brendan Kincaid. Brendan's brother Will states he will be the next Earl if he gets married in a short period of time and follows all the rules of the 'Game'. The characaters had some great connection - not my favorite book I have read but over all I will read other books by this author.
2,great sound from a one piece unit,this machine has amazing bass and plenty of volume. if your looking for quality sound thats portable this is it. it also has a cool red ring that lights up when you turn on the subwoofer. very pleased with this product.
2,Great show,"I love this show, and I sincerely hope it doesn't get cancelled. However, I must say that it is not quite at the level that it was in season 1. Still a great show!"
2,Very relevant for every reader,"Even if you are not involved with the 3HO organization there is a lot of wisdom for everyone in this book. Focuses on life events like Love, Happiness and Wisdom. This is the kind of book that you can return to over and over."
2,This Is All You Need,"I just replaced a significantly more expensive Terk HDTVi indoor antenna with this simple and inexpensive RCA antenna. The Terk looked great, but had such a poorly designed base that it was nearly impossible to balance and position-I'll be sending that one back to Amazaon. I went over to my local Best Buy and found this unit, hooked it up-wala; picked up significantly MORE HD stations and this unit is stable and easy to position and move around (which is the objective in maneuvering for best reception). I'd highly recommend this unit-as far as I am concerned it does what it's supposed to do, easily outperforms (at least in my case) more expensive indoor antennas, and is just a great darn value!"
2,Great for price,"These pregnancy test strips are great if you are trying to get pregnant and want to test often. I have used them with my last 3 pregnancies. I am able to get a very, very faint positive 4 days before my period. They are cheap and good to use."
2,desk,"Very happy with this desk. I was looking for something to fit in a small corner. It was easy to set up, tools were included. I can fit the screen and speakers on the desk top. The keyboard slides in and out, the bottom fits the printer and drive. The entire desk is solid, another plus for a fair price. pjm"
2,Credible expose' from credible people,"I watch CNN, read newspapers, etc., all this video did for me was to reinforce what the mainstream latent neutered media is only now beginning to haphazzardly report to the American Public. I'm not interested in people assertions that the information contained within this video is yet another attempt by the democrats to demonize the republican party or that anyone who disagrees with it is somehow ""unamerican."" All I'm interested is in the facts... just the facts. I found the information to be accurate based on what I knew already and know of no reason any of the credible, distinguished participants who shared information would be anything other than candid. If you're in the dark, don't read much, or listen to spindoctored newscasts this DVD may illuminate some important issues for you. For some of you, I would also suggest watching this in short segments as you may be able to only take what I believe to be the truth in small doses..."
2,Awesome,"The Matrix Online is not only a great game, but it actually has STORY - something no other MMO does. If you know anything at all about The Matrix movies, then this is the place for you. YOU get to take part in telling the future story of the Matrix though what you do in the game. I have already has contact with Morpheus and Niobe and even fought Agents...awesome!"
2,An AMAZING BOOK!!,What an amazing book! I found it to be extremely well written and clear. I have tried 7 recipes and each one has been amazingly delicious! I find that the extra tips are extremely helpful and clear. This book has even inspired me to buy a KitchenAid mixer to go with my book!I think that this book is a 'MUST HAVE' if you enjoy baking!
2,"Good stuff, works well","My yellow lab has constant ear problems. Her only relief was the medication purchased at the vet's office which gave temporary relief and then the problems would return again.I saw that other people had purchased this item and had gotten good results so I decided to try it out. I am happy I did. Her ears don't bother her as much, when they do I just give them each a quick rinse with this stuff and it seems to clear up immediately. And the price is great compared to what a vet would charge. My bottle did arrive damaged and leaking but I did not complain as it was usable.This is one of the best ear washes I've used, It works and works well! I would recommend this product."
2,"This is not a review, it is info from the back cover:","""Their mission was to seek and destroy the enemy in perilous low-flying night raids over the Ho Chi Minh Trail. They were the SPECTRE flyboys, an elite squadron of combat vets flying AC-130 gunships - converted cargo planes that became the ultimate weapons in a butal guerilla war.A hot-shot gunner in a top secret campaign, Major Hal Zorn plunged into the heat of battle with the fearless SPECTRE flyers. In treacherous nighttime assaults along the Laotian panhandle, they swooped low and aimed to kill. Amid the madness, the bravery and the wild, unexpected humor of men at war, Zorn flew to the lmits of human compassion and fury, to triumph over the unseen enemy below."""
2,20 Questions,"This is a very good version of 20 Q with a vast data bank. The only problem I can find is that it can't guess itself as the thing you're thinking of! You can set sound on/off (just beeps); answer yes, no, sometimes, or unknown; and the set speed of the scrolling. When it asks you what type of thing it is, things that are normally vegetable (like ""chair"" if it's made from wood, ""paper"", ""maple syrup"") fall under the ""other"" category. ""Vegetable"" only holds vegetables (parsley, spinach...)."
2,Awesome movie,"This movie, I would have to say, was the best movie I've ever seen. I watched it probably about 5 times since I first received it. This movie was awesome."
2,love,"the movie is beautiful love story, can watch it over and over, do hope the sequel follows soon, ,"
2,A Good Historical Recordings,"Yes, there are some major cuts in this recording (including the sublime quintet), but as a historical recording this is a must have. The sound is pretty good for 1943 standards, it is well sung, and, given that it was recorded in Germany in 1943, Hans Sachs' command ""Ehrt eure deutschen Meister..."" (Honor your German masters) has never been more chilling."
2,x-large 950 elk skin gloves -finger too long but nice quality,"Index finger is way to long on the left hand by 1"". It's the same length as the middle one or longer on this pair. I have big hands with long fingers so I don't think its me. The skin is good and thick. The Tag Says ""Sewn in America with import or domestic materials"". Chinese elk? No- Must be the elastic or stitching thread. Other than the finger length I think these might be really amazing gloves. -Waiting for the replacement from Amazon."
2,amazing perfection!,"The Paris Opera Corps is the best,I just keep asking myself if they are human, they are like clones.After 5 Bayaredes, this is still the best choice, even if Isabelle Guerin is a little cold faced, (after all, french dancers are not passionate, aren't they?) or perhaps because perfection is cold.The coreography from Nureyev is beautiful,very dinamic, the sets and costumes are sumptuous, stunning Etoiles and soloist,Elizabeth Platel is the perfect balance technique and artistry.This is the glory of BALLET"
2,Audiovox XM XMFM1 FM Direct Adapter -worth it,"Bought this for wife's 2006 H3 because the XM direct RF car transmitter that comes with the Onyx didn't work well at all. After getting the Audiovox XM XMFM1 FM Direct Adapter I also purchased a GM antena adapter to go with it. I did have to take the radio out which wasn't to hard(I looked it up online to make it easier)I then hooked in all the connections, 1 to back of Radio other to the antena,and 1 to the XM dock.Put some electical tape around the antena adaptor and radio connections to make sure they don't come loose. Once all is back together I tried it out and it worked great.Basically it puts a hard wired signal from your XM radio directly into the car antena instead of relying on the XM's RF transmitter which does it through the air. I didn't use the hardwired 12v plug that came with it."
2,Finding Shakespeare,"This documentary truly changed how I think about Shakespeare's plays, words and actors. It is a must for American audience and anyone for that matter who wants to understand the Shakespeare's language.Useful for college students."
2,awsome,this is a great scary mistory can be very sad but it makes you injoy the tv show a lot love it
2,Kuhn Rikon LaPatisserie Cookie Press,My grandchildren like to make the sort of cookies a cookie press makes. They like the various shapes. They are tasty too. This one is easy to use and to clean up. The clear barrel lets you see just how much dough is in it. I'd recommend it.
2,A must read,"I have been in the ministry for over 40 years and have served as a pastor, university administrator, and professor. This is one of the finest books for helping Christians who are struggling in their spiritual development and are having trouble moving beyond the guilt stage of failure to live up to others' expectations and are searching for the liberating life which comes from a surrender to God's love and grace. Dr. Bobo combines his years as a university professor with a deep compassion for ""everyday"" Christians who are caught in the web of ""spiritual-growth-by-works"" trap - and the Christian life has become a drudgery. This book is also a great guide for new believers and ""seekers"" who are curious to know the true meaning of the Good News It is a must read!"
2,Probably the best available...,"FYI: you don't need volume 2... This book is cryptic and messy, but so is X. I've used it a lot whenever the man pages get too ugly."
2,Works for me!,"I bought this item 3-4 years ago,although mine does not have the timer like the newer models. Initially it worked for a few days and then I couldn't get the toaster to shut off. When I contacted Black and Decker they informed me that they no longer did repairs, but would replace the item. All I had to do was to tell them the model"
2,History of New York,This an extremely well written book. It is written as a satire so I am not sure about the historical accuracy although I have read nothing to make me doubt it. It is written from the Dutch perspective which makes it interesting. It is easy to see why Washington Irving is still read today.
2,10 Years,"Channing Tatum! Wow, what can I say. One friend even named her son after him. Nice film but could have had more depth."
2,Bravissimo,"After being the lead singer of the Mano Negra, Manu Chao decides to go solo and to travel around the world. From his trip to Latin America, Manu brought back a beautiful album that mixes flavours from Mexico, Brazil, and the Revolution. With thoughtful and poetic lyrics, sung in no less than 4 languages, and beautiful music, Manu Chao gave us an amazing gift. So far, I have not met anyone yet that did not totally love it. And by the way, this album has already been a hit in France for the last year or so."
2,Confusion Reigns!,"Valerian Romney is wrongly accused of his father's murder and flees disguised as the wife of his older brother Phelan. In disguise he falls in love with a confused Sophie whom he must resist due to his disguise. Meanwhile, Phelan falls for Juliette, who is fleeing an abusive husband disguised as a boy. With everyone's efforts to remain disguised and yet resist the person they love, the story becomes very funny. But--there is still a killer and an abusive husband to deal with, and when the book reaches its frightening climax, the scene is the equal of any thriller you have ever read. A funny, romantic, and in the end, exciting book, well worth reading and rereading. Ms. Stuart has done it again!"
2,It is a great story of survival that everyone should read!,"My opinion of this book is that is an excellent must-read for younger kids. It has good detailing, good plot, a good topic, and wasn't boring at all. There were a few parts/characters that I didn't like, though. A few parts weren't explained well. I didn't like Jello, the wolf, Miyax's (Julie) mother-in-law, Miyax's husband, and the fact that the bird Miyax found died in the end. That was sad. The people who would probably enjoy this book the most would probably be in the grades 4th-8th."
2,An action packed MUST read!,"I've never read this series before, but I loved it, and I'm ordering more! I'm surprized that I didn't hear about it sooner, but by the number of previews, good news sure travels fast! I loved the characters! Jaina is so much like me, which helps me realate to her point of veiw. I've never actuley seen any Star Wars movies, but I've reas so many Star Wars Series thst I really don't need to now! It was very content, and clearly written. Perfect for all kids teen-aged! A must read!"
2,I like this book,"I am biased because I am the author of this book. I wrote this novel as a tribute of my love to my kids. The story is very close to real life, except for all the violent parts."
2,Silvertone S11 electric guitar package,"We bought this for our 11-year-old son for Christmas. Was worried that it might have problems. Delighted to report that it came out of the box, with strings on, and everything works perfectly. My son is delighted. Great beginning guitar for the price."
2,"""looks like a no brainer""","As far as bad movies go, this one has it all. Cheesy one-liners, extreme gore, nonstop action, some bad language, gratuitous sexual content; and, a hot chick with a machine gun leg. This is one of those movies where you will laugh and cringe at the same time. Acting is intentionally overdone; so, it's actually good acting! The picture is ok; but, has been edited to make it look faded, scrathed-up and older. That's because it's paying tribute to the Grindhouse films of old. Sound is great; but, a little too good for a grindhouse film. The only thing about the blu-ray is, that I wish they would drop the scratch-free version; and, add the theatrical cut in whole. On the whole, I liked Planet Terror a little better then Death Proof."
2,Crosley Explorer Radio -- Used with Satellite Radio,"Crosley Explorer 1 XM Tabletop RadioWhat a great product !! I use it with satellite radio and listen to it often. I keep it on in my bedroom all night, on a music channel. So soothing!! Well worth the price, and I recommend it highly."
2,"great product,",i like the cliper and its been working great. for that price i think it is a good bargaina aand buying
2,pretty good scanner,"For the price of $70-100 there are about 6-7 scanners. I picked HP for a simple reason -- proven durability. We have a couple of HP scanners at work and they've been used heavily for the past 3 years with zero problems. I've talked to many people who had Epsons and they all had problems of various kinds.For the good: It scannes the old pictures very well. I come from a very ""old"" family and we have lots of pictures from 1800's. They turned out very good and easy to restore with editing software like the photoshop.For the not-so-good: The software is a bit ""clunky"". Seems like it has too many tools that do the same job. A simple all-in-one program would have been just fine.For the strange: Where's the power switch? You will need to physically unplug it if you'd like to save a couple of KWatts. One star taken off for that.Otherwise a solid product that does the job."
2,An AMAZING Trovatore,"Callas, Lauri-Volpi, Elmo and Serafin team up for the greatest Trovatore in history. This is a highly underrated performance, much better than the late studio-recording! BUY IT, it's miraculous!"
2,Best family movie ever!,"Stephen Chow is a brilliant actor, writer, and movie maker. This is a touching movie that our family watches over and over.I appreciate how he infuses his personal ideals(no stealing, swearing, or fighting) into a beautifully crafted script.There is too much to say about this movie. Buy it!"
2,WWW The Best of RAW 2009,"I ordered this DVD for my grandson son who is 10.You thought I gave him a millon dollars.He watches it often, just the smile on his face made it all worth while, it was a Birthday gift."
2,Buy this thing,"I use a PC at work and a Mac at home. This device allowed me to move files easily between home and work.Its portable and easy to use, no software to install, just plug it in and proceed to move files."
2,"All-over toning, stretching, and very relaxing!","This is a good workout that will make you feel like you are shaping your body. However, I don't think that there is enough of a cardio factor to really help with weight loss. I do love being able to customize the level at which I do workouts. Every move starts with the level 1, then are modified to levels 2 and 3. Then, a full set is done at whatever level you choose. It's nice that you don't have to stick with the same level for the whole workout (which is about 35 minutes). You can work on your weakest areas at level 1, then easily switch to level 2. I really like the instructor. She's not too peppy or ridiculously ripped or skinny (you feel like you could actually look like her without starving yourself or having just good genetics). A good overall toning workout."
2,Just Walk Away....,"Kell Bell! You did it again! Absolutely Flawless. Taken from the Grammy winning album Breakaway, Kelly tells you to walk off her if you don't know what you want. Chosen as the fifth and final single from the album, it keeps climbing the charts. Remixes are always superb with the right touch. After seeing her live twice, this is the best beginning girl anthem of 2006! Be sure to preview remixes! If you like this single, I also recommend the import singles Since U Been Gone, Behind These Hazel Eyes, and Because of You here at Amazon! Go ahead ""Walk Away"" with this cd!"
2,Secret Love was worth the wait,"Secret Love, the long awaited spinoff from Brenda Jackson's Madaris family series, was worth the wait. The steam from Jake and Diamond's love affair rises from the pages. Don't miss it."
2,Simple but effective,This is kind of a common sense book. It's brief and told in little stories. Almost biblical. This is a code to live by.
2,worked,good comb and worked. however I am not sure why my cat did not like it. My cat runs away every time I use it on him
2,THE BEST STRAINER/WORTH THE MONEY,"A LITTLE MORE MONEY THAN SOME OTHER BRANDS,BUT WORTH EVERY PENNEY.IDEAL FOR EVERYDAY USE,FROM PASTA TO CLEANING BERRY'S.AND OF COURSE THE KITCHENAID QUALITY,I LOVE THE COBALT BLUE,I OWN ALOT OF KITCHEN AID FROM THE STANDMIXER TO A SCRAPPER,AND THEY ARE ALL THE BEST."
2,"Here comes the sexy, ultra portable Nano iPod","[...]Review:This will be the best selling player on the market. With a color screen, ultra portability, the nano is awesome. But, there are major flaws such as scratches. I know the ipod tend to scratch easily. But just one day in my pocket the nano was full of scratches, which is ridiculous. Buy the white nano because you won't see as many scractches. Also buy a screen protector!!! You will be thanking me later. Also, there seems to be a little buzz in the background when you play an mp3 song.Will cont. to update."
2,Flash from the PAst,"This book has the feel of a by-gone era.Jack WIlliamson takes us on a journey through a series of worlds connected once under a great civilization, but struggling to recover from that civilization's failure in the deep recesses of the past.This book could have been considerably longer, but Vance chooses to give us the dime tour of his different worlds, touching on themes like automated environments still running sans people and jungle slaves fighting for freedom against a civilization based on slavery.As usual a very satisfying read."
2,GOOD MOUNT,SHIPS FAST . MY CUSTOMER REALY LIKES IT COMPARED TO A WINDSHEILD MOUNT . HE SAYS IT SAFER TO DRIVE WITH.
2,Sterling Silver Collar Necklace by Sajen - Love the necklace,This necklace was all I expected and more. It is now my go to necklace. I can dress it up for business wear or dress it down for jeans and tee-shirt. Good quality. Love it!!!!
2,Great product,The Cannon release has worked perfectly! They have allowed me to fish with no worry about the line coming loose from the down line.
2,One of the finest PR texts available,"I've recently attended Mr. Seitel's PR workshop. A truly excellent and insightful lecture about the truths of PR: how to obtain professional, real results without the BS.Follow his advice and you will truly be successful in either a corporate or agency environment"
2,a wonderful tool for Bible students,"I love this book so much. It is so easy to find what you are looking for in the alphabetical format. In the palm of your hand you have an A to Z listing of all the places and people of the Bible. Not only that, but the information is presented in an easy to understand, often humorous fashion. I highly recommend this book to anyone studying the Bible."
2,Still relevant...,"It's odd that something written about the Internet four years ago would still be relevant today, considering how fast the 'net has evolved and exploded, but it's true - Silicon Snake Oil remains every bit an apt commentary and reality check today as it was when it was written. I had first read it back in 1995, and just last week skimmed through it again. True, a lot of the details are outdated and history has (almost comically) outdone even Stoll's most outlandish predictions, but the book should nevertheless be read and digested for its humorous and interesting presentation of a serious viewpoint. I'm just wondering what Mr. Stoll would say now, given the extraordinary events of the past few years..."
2,A Donuthead Review,"Dounut head is the story of a boy who is anything but normal. He is the only boy he knows without a father, and with a name just asking to be made fun of. He seems to have an ubsesive compultion when it comes to being clean, and he isnt into getting down and dirty. He can always find a way to get out of playing sports or anything that could be unsafe. But then he meets the dirty faced Sarah Kervick, who is new to his school and is quickly rejected by everyone including donuthead. He soon befriends her and shows her the ture meaning of clean."
2,Boys would really like this,"This movie has a lot of things boys like - Dragons, flying, Wizards, magic. It really has a pretty good story with twists and turns clever enough to surprise kids. The only reasons I gave it 4 rather than 5 stars is the animation of the characters could be better (like the new GI Joe movie), but some of the structures and scenes are quite beautiful. In the sequel to this movie, the directors should do more first person view shots like things flying past and almost hitting you etc. for even more excitement. Overall, a very good story."
2,I have had almost zero problems with this,"This product has performed as expected for me and I have not had the software problems that some others obviously have experienced. I have also found the product easy to use and it works perfectly with my laptop. I had some issues with setup, but nothing that I could not solve myself with some general monkeying round. I have about 16GB of music loaded on mine and it works fine every time I use it. My only complaints are battery life seems a bit short and the manual is not very good. Also, I agree that the design is not as attractive as the ipod. Overall I'm very satisfied."
2,Great product,The AA battery is much longer life to use than any other AA battery we used before. I took over 300 pictures and couple short (2 min) videos and flash used with just couple batteries. It's really amazing. And the price is very good. You will save a lot.
2,Great Little Quiet Album,"What a wonderful surprise this CD is. It's very low-key, with simple arrangements. Very organic.This is a CD that highlights the songs. Jenna Mammina, who is a good singer, doesn't overwhelm the songs. Instead, she lets the songs say what they were intended to say with no overt interruption from the singer or the band.The song ""A Love That Lasts"" has absolutely blown me away. Such melancholy, such hope - all rolled into one. And Jenna's voice on this song underscores both of those sentiments beautifully.Enjoy this CD. I wish all ""American Idol"" contestants would listen to this CD; they might, then, learn what real singing is really all about."
2,A beautiful movie,"A very unusual movie which will appeal to adults and children alike. It is funny, has a moral and a very touching ending. Make sure the tissues are handy! Look out for the cameo appearance of Bjorn Andresen as the pianist, hardly recognisable as the young lad from ""Death In Venice""."
2,Old School Nuclear Propaganda Produced By Disney,"I bought a used hardcover edition. Nice size and easy to read. Good fundamentals with history about the (uranium) atom and its development while learning to split the atom for a multitude of uses. Unfortunately, the conclusion of the book touts the splitting the atom as a useful tool for the future, the future is now and shows there is no 'OFF' switch when it comes to nuclear chain reactions with their waste byproducts which must be securely stored, some for thousands of years. Nuclear 'waste' handling is not addressed in the book.Nuclear disasters including past above ground nuclear testing shows only to raise background cancer causing radiation levels by adding fallout to the atmosphere, never a good thing especially when living near nuclear power plants with their 24 hour continuous releasing of invisible radionuclides.There is Disney's video version of 'Our Friend The Atom' found on YouTube for those who don't like to read."
2,Great remaster,"I love this cd almost as much as the Stormwatch cd remaster. It has excellent songs such as Acres wild, And the mouse police never sleeps, Rover, One brown mouse and Moths. No lullaby is pretty cool also. The title track Heavy horses, Weathercock and Journeyman are the weaker songs on the cd for me, but they are good in bits. No lullaby and Heavy horses sound alot heavier and cooler in live recordings from this era. Living in these hard times and broadford bazaar are decent additions. I was surprised not to see Blues instrumental included on this cd. It is a very cool blues/fusion song from 1978 and would make my fave songs from this era. Also, A stitch in time and Beltane are two other goodies which were released on Stormwatch and Songs from the wood remasters respectively, but those songs were from 1978, so I think they should have made this cd. If those 3 songs were included, I would love it as much as Stormwatch"
2,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,I ordered this DVD for my husband who was a Harry Potter fan and he watched it many times before he died. I then gave it to my younger brother for his enjoyment.
2,Great old time Guitar CD!,"This is one of James Alan Shelton's many solo CD's he's released in recent years, this was his first instrumental CD, and one of the best. It has some great old traditional tunes, including an old Carter Family tune, Old Gospel Ship. And James also shows his songwriting talents with Twilight Swamp. And another highlight of this CD is a special guest visit from Dr. Ralph Stanley himself on Old Time Pickin', a great old time clawhammer banjo style song. If you like tradional bluegrass instrumentals, and great crosspicking, this is the CD for you!"
2,Great to prevent UTI's,My little old dog was on a very strict diet but still kept getting urinary tract infections. After the 3rd one in a year and a half (poor thing) I put her on a scoop of this every day. It has been 7 years since her last UTI!
2,NO FRILLS IS RIGHT,"Bette made a great album in the 80's that nobody bought and got zero airplay. Why? The video for Beast of Burden got lots a play on MTV at the time, should have been a huge hit for her. But it wasn't. Oh well. Who says radio programmers or most of the public for that matter, know what's good and what isn't."
2,LOVELY FOR AFTER HOURS,With its notes of vanilla and coriander plus an overall oriental cast this perfume is lovely for evening wear.For daytime use perhaps one of the lighter Moschino fragrances would be most appropriate.
2,sweet and playful!,"What a sweet and playful book this is. I read this author's other book (TRUST ME) last fall and found it charming (I am an animal lover and TRUST ME featured a lot of animals, which was fun for me). MAN TROUBLE has a different tone, but is very entertaining. The heroine starts out mousy, tries to force glamor, and finds herself somewhere in between. And I always like when a man isn't so much as ""tamed"" by a good woman, but becomes comfortable enough with himself because of her that he finds himself all on his own. Much more believable that way. My only complaint with MAN TROUBLE was that it didn't last the whole weekend for me -- I read it straight through."
2,Classic Garage available for 1st time on CD!!,"This CD compiles the The Gruesomes best tracks from their first three lps (Tyrants of Teen Trash, Gruesomania, and HEY!) along with cuts from two eps (Jack the ripper and Unchained) as well as a live cut and a few other rarities. With 25 tracks it is well worth the money: but be forwarned -most tracks are two minutes long! The Gruesomes are a fun, 60's garage band from Canada and this record is great for me as I cannot find the Lps on vinyl anywhere!! Any fans of this stlye of snotty 60's punk will love this mindbending comp!"
2,Nutritious and Delicious,"This cereal is very delicious. I love it because it has 3g protein and 3g fiber and amaranth,quinoa, and corn flour. It has a great texture and rich tast. I would definitely recommend it."
2,Worth Discovering,"A girl in the theater brought this CD into the dressing rooms during our last set of shows. Just on the tail end of unexpected news of the death of a friend the day before, the songs made me cry. Bad timing. But three weeks after, I bought the CD and listened to it through again. It brought back some good memories, and not only because I knew my friend would have liked it. It's insightful, well-crafted and has a lyrical, haunting quality much like short ballads that stick with you for a while. Worth discovering."
2,great read! great service!,"This book is life changing. I challenge you to read it and find yourself within the pages. The thoughts, processes and ideas expressed make for an entertaining read full of information and a release from the pressure of this world."
2,Great book for beginners...,"I'm in the game industry, and this book is right on in its techniques, and tutorials! This guy knows what he's talking about, and his easy to follow tutorials are great. Beware, this book is more for begginers, showing you the basics. I do wish he had gotten a little more into advanced technique in photoshop."
2,The Babe: More than a legend,"The casting of John Goodman was a masterstroke for this film. He provides great energy and the cuddly presence of Babe Ruth naturally.Ruth's generosity is well conveyed in this film. Whether it was a child ill in hospital or a teammate he was selfless when it came to giving.So many baseball records were set by Ruth, and for those fans that were lucky enough to see him play often witnessed history in the making.This film portrays Ruth as a baseball phenomenon and an at times decadent fun loving person, who liked to give.Nicholas R.W. Henning - Australian Baseball Author"
2,Pleased with product,"I ordered this Bunn Glass Coffee Decanter for our office to replace an original decanter that met an untimely demise (we broke it). While the decanter body was not completely round as you usually see, it was a Bunn decanter and works great with our office Bunn coffee machine. From placement of the order until arrival of the package was a short time period. The decanter was packaged minimally but safely. Would recommend to everyone."
2,understanding Colour,"Using the book in conjunction with other Texts . very practical Book . Ideal for creating your first colour wheel . Explains Tones and Complementary colours in a simple and PRACTICAL way . I have been using it to play with mixing colours on my Palette , and recording the end result as a data-base for future reference . very much hands on book . Handy tool to use for on's painting journey"
2,The first black and white I've watched,"This was a ""what others have viewed"" when I was streaming some videos and I didn't realize it was a 50's movie. I normally skip right over black and whites, but decided to give this one a try. Surprisingly good movie. It dragged in some areas, but the acting was good and the story was intriguing...made you wonder how much she'd get away with.The disclaimer at the end is funny to read given today's culture. There is zero gore in this film, it's all implied.Can't say I'll be queuing up the b&w;'s now, but glad I watched this one. Just wish it was 20-30 minutes shorter."
2,"The Cultivation of Hemp: Botany, Varieties, Cultivation and Harvesting","This is the seminal work of its kind to the farming of industrial hemp. As the long and ridiculous prohibition on growing industrial hemp in the United States comes to an end, most of our wannabe hemp farmers will need and find this information most helpful since so much about hemp farming has been lost during the ban. As more people realize the value of hemp to our farming, manufacturing and retail economies, the more they will need to know about it in order to maximize their efforts and outcomes. This is well written and easy to read; a no nonsense text crammed full of what we need to know about hemp farming and processing. Though highly recommended by VoteHemp, it is out of print. I am grateful to have found it available through a seller at Amazon for a reasonable price."
2,Nice leather case for Nook,"The case is of good leather quality and does protect the Nook. It fits snuggly and you can read with the case on. I would have liked the case to have covered the sides and top and bottom of the Nook, protecting it if it is dropped on its side. It also had a chemical smell that lasted quite a few weeks. Overall, I really like the cover and think it is a good item for the price."
2,Wonderful DVD!,"This 2-disc box set has episodes 14-26(the second half of the series). The first DVD has episodes 14-20. The second DVD has episodes 21-26 and the extras(like Volume 1, the extras are great). The extras are an art gallery & the second non-credit ending(the second half of the show has a new ending!).It also has the Bonus Theaters Magical Girl Lyrical Amila, Video Jack Misa, Pretty Sammy Murder Mystery, and the Pretty Sammy Movie Trailer. The episodes are only in Japanese with subtitles, but don't let that stop you."
2,Begin at the BEGINning,The driving force with which the feedback fills your ears to start of the lead track on this album make it my favorite R.E.M. tune of all time. WARNING! Do not play this song while driving a motor vehicile. This ranks as one of the most drop-the-hammer-esque songs ever written. Buy the album. You will not be disappointed.
2,"AWSOME, Wore It, Loved It, Would Buy Again.","I bought this product Junior Year of High School to wear at a high school dance. I threw a small pre-dance party at my house and placed 10 bracelets in each goodie bag for my guests.Before going to the dance I covered both my arms with bracelets. I also connected them to make necklaces. Looked awesome. Wore them with my Platform Dolly shoes and plaid skirt.Product is great for raves, dances, nights out,Sleep overs, and Halloween. Any night occasion with friends...except for movie theaters. People get really angry if you are wearing these at the movie theater.Also great way to keep track of where your friends are. Could also be used for night time games that require teams."
2,"Great product, but read return policy!","Compressor does not work and Amazon does not accept returns on this product. They should not sell products that cannot be returned if they are faulty. Proceed with caution when buying any product on Amazon if it cannot be returned! Read the fine print on returns!Update 7/15/2012: Bought a second one of these and it works great. Only problem is that if it does not work, you cannot return it to Amazon."
2,The Fifth Element - Blu-ray,"Love the movie and always have -- since this is my first Blu-ray experience, I don't have much to compare it to, but I thought it was great -- the colors and the concept/special effects are something, even after all this time."
2,Our kitty loves it,We originally mixed half of this pet food with another brand. Our kitty would eat all of this pet food and leave the other brand untouched. She loves it.
2,Simply Amazing,There are not enough stars to rate this Bible. It should receive 10 stars. This would make for an excellent Christmas present. I plan to order more for the holiday. Well worth every penny and then some.
2,Its like Haven,"This album is similar to Haven. It has some good heavy atmospheric metal songs with brutal and in some points <<normal>> vocals. I cant say i love it -> there are not <<hits>> or songs that make so much difference between i like it and i love it. I suggest this album only to gothic / atmospheric metal fans. Also as an advice -> don't hear too much this album, its too depressive and melancholic -> for special occasions only."
2,Emotional Music,"A very unusual Phil Woods album. A great be-bop player, here Woods is playing over lush strings some of the most beautiful melodies ever written. Legrand plays some very nice piano in support. This album is for listeners who like to be taken on emotional rides to the heavens."
2,Orville has won my heart!,"I bought this on a whim and it has now become a staple in our kitchen pantry and my desk drawer at work. It is definitely the closest thing to popping your own popcorn. It uses real butter with just the right amount of salt. The popcorn itself is very light and fluffy and I've noticed that I don't end up with a lot of un-popped kernels like I have with others. Recently a picky co-worker of mine grabbed a handful and was so impressed with it that he had me write down the name and brand so that he could buy some himself.Here on Amazon it seems to average between $.70 - $.83 per bag which is very competitive with my local grocer, but I can put it on Subscribe & Save to get it for less here. Additionally Amazon often has sales where I've received $10 off my grocery purchase which is nice too."
2,"EXACTLY THE SAME AS Equestriad 2001, but with Fewer Glitches","This is the EXACT game as Equestriad 2001. My friend has this game and I learned that it doesn't have as many glitches as Equestriad 2001 does, though. The sound works and I like the PS2 controls better. It was a very good game and I enjoyed it alot. If you have a PS2, get this game instead of Equestriad 2001. The sound works better. However, the only thing you can do is 3-day eventing, practice, and multiplayer- the same with Equestriad. I like games where you care for the horses a little better. The graphics were cool, though. I liked customising the rider and the horse the best. You pick your outfit and your horse's color/markings. This game deserves 4 stars. It's a ton of fun!"
2,"Works just fine, excellent customer service","Taken, you have to know what you are doing. Yes, we are talking about a simple battery charger.The charger charges AA and AAA batteries, it can be either a single battery, 2, 3 or 4 of them. Each compartment which holds a battery has dual connectors, depending on which size battery you insert (AAA's go in the back, AA's in the front). If you don't insert them correctly, well, then the charger wont work.When fully charged, the charger supposedly starts trickle charging, so the batteries are being maintained and not overcharged.I own quite a few of these combos. I had only 7 batteries going bad on me so far, and they were replaced by the company without any hassle (of course I had the purchase receipt)."
2,Unique and Amusing,Fforde's well designed and intreaguing alternative England is thoroughly created and fascinating. His characters are amusing and I laughed out loud several times while enjoying their escapades. A very different book and nice change of pace. Can't wait to read the rest!
2,Awesome book,"This is THE book to get. Could certainly do without all the Oprah references, though. Too bad there isn't an Oprah-free copy available."
2,love it,I like the way it spent off by her being in a comma and in the end his other wife in a comma
2,"Insert pun on ""Enchanted"" here","A must-read for fans of both chick-lit and Harry Potter-esque fantasy, Enchanted, Inc. was a great novel. Fun, funny and with characters who leave you desperately wanting more. I strongly recommend it to anyone capable of reading."
2,Cute Doris Day Comedy,"Doris Day and James Garner had a wonderful chemistry, first-evidenced when Universal paired them in THE THRILL OF IT ALL!, a bubbly romantic comedy about the tenacious power balance between husband and wife.Beverly Boyer (Doris Day) is a devoted wife and mother who suddenly finds nation-wide fame as the star of the ""Happy Soap"" TV commercials. Her successful obstetrician husband Gerald (James Garner) finds himself thrust into the position of being ""Mr Beverly Boyer"" as their marriage and private-life careens into a media frenzy. Can marriage survive life in the spotlight?...Adorable romantic comedy with Doris Day at the top of her form. The Boyer children are played winningly by Brian Nash and Kim Karath (best-remembered as little Gretl in ""The Sound of Music""). The cast also includes Arlene Francis, Elliott Reid, ZaSu Pitts and Edward Andrews. This was one of the first major screenplays by Carl Reiner, following years of solid TV comedy writing."
2,Ok for the Price,I bought this for a quick and cheap solution to getting my desktop online. It installed easy on Windows 7 32bit and 64bit using the Vista drivers included on the cd. It works well for browsing websites but when I do heavy downloading or video streaming on sites like hulu it tends to get hot and I lose connection for about a minute.(before someone says it could be my wireless router: when I lose connection on the desktop I fire up my laptop and it connects so I know its not the router)For the price I'm fairly pleased with it but I'm looking for an internal PCI wireless card to replace this.If you're looking for a cheap quick solution for browsing websites and checking email this is a good device but if you're like me and do heavy downloading and streaming spend a little extra and get an internal card.
2,This is Old Classic amd Great Sims,"On Windows 98 this game was a dream to play. I had to use a joystick/game pad to get the tanks to move around better. It takes some doing and not getting yourself blow up all the time. This is multi tasking driving and you have to stop and shot and not do both like in modern tanks sims. Graphic is Ok and plain, you need a good eyes to spot the AT guns ready to pin you. Too bad they never updated it. I believe it runs on Win XP, but not sure about Windows Vista and Win7. I think you need a speical program to allow you play on those OS. Their are some around I use them. Too bad I love the old DOS and Win95/98 games. Which I could play all my old favorites. Thye were simple and easy to play like this one. Never get tired playing it."
2,"Different, but good","Bourne is back! But is it the real Bourne? This one is filled with packed action. The twists aren't as many, but the tension and action zip along at a hasty pace. A great sequel to the awesome Bourne Identity. Read it."
2,Truly Uplifting,"It doesn't happen for me often, but every once in a blue moon, I read a story that touches my heart and soul. This beautiful story by Tim Greaton is such a book. It is a ""Christmasy"" story to an extent, but it can be enjoyed any time of year. Greaton's book teaches a few very important lessons about love, understanding, forgiveness, hope, and acceptance.Unlike some who have commented, I was able to connect with the main character, Skip, right away. I rode the tide of pain along with him as he speaks about his losses, which are many. I also fell in love with the characters who, although had smaller parts in the book, made a big impact.This is a lovely book that needs to be shared with the world. I've read it twice now and each time, I took something from it lifted my spirits and made me smile. It is truly an inspirational story that can teach us all so much."
2,Great Game and Great Price,"We got this whole package from Amazon for $19.99. That included the game and the bongos. It is a very fun game (a tad childish, but still fun)."
2,ONE OF THE BEST ALBUMS THUS FAR,"I'm not a big rock fan, as a matter of fact, I prefer Rap like 50 cent and Mobb Deep. I only started listening to Rock a few years ago when I heard Coldplay's ""Clocks."" After that I felt in love with this sort of New Wave style of rock; Coldplay, The Postal Service, and The Killers are on the top of my list. The Killers did a great job with this album, most of the songs are those type of songs that could be a sitcom's theme song, if you know what I mean. My favorite is ""Smile Like You Mean It""; it has a slow start but then the drums kick in, with a great chorus. Another good one is ""On Top,"" as it has sort of a techno-rock vibe to it.Overall, I recommend this album to anyone who likes great music, regardless of what you're into."
2,"Cute and Fun, Not so Romantic","I enjoyed this book immensely. The characters were fun, the dialog witty and the story well paced. However, I didn't find there to be much romance or much mystery for that matter. The mystery of the woman in the freezer was never really solved, it was just sort of resolved at the end. And the ""romance"" of course resolved itself as romances always do.It's a light, enjoyable read that's perfect for the beach or killing time in an airport."
2,A Fitting End,"I have to disagree with the other reviews here, I believe Ghosts to be an equal to the first book. Chalker has made possibly his most accessable book for a decade. The race aginst time to defeat an unstopable foe really sets the sequels pace. I thought it was great that Chalker finally explored the water races in greater depths(No pun intended). Whilst the story may lack the epic feel of the last Well World sagas it makes up for it with fantastic storytelling and some of Chalker's best character work ever. A must for fans and non-fans alike."
2,Coffee hour,"Our church kitchen already has owned a Westbend coffee urn for several years and it works great. When our other, very old coffee urn quit working last month I ordered a new Westbend. We are very happy with it. I got to be the first one to use it for our coffee hour and tried the first cup--it makes excellant coffee (and I am very picky about the taste of coffee)!"
2,Excellent wireless headphone,"This headphone works pretty good.Just a few notes of concern but frankly not anything major:The headset is little loose because it's a little too big.when there is no signal, you will get noise if you keep the headset on.The base is very light and tips sometimes when I lift the headset.Now the good side:for a wireless it produces very good sound.I keep the headphones on and go room to room without any problem or interference. Sometimes I have it on for seven eight hours without batteries running out. Batteries are standard AAA size rechargeable.If I had choice, would I buy it again?You bet."
2,Don't know what to do after first contact with Java.,"This books provide details, tools and WORKING EXAMPLES into technology such as Java Bean, SSL, XML parse, Servlet, JDBC. This will help you understand Java and XML more with the tools comes in the disk."
2,THIS BOOK ROCKS!,"Pls! READ READ READ READ READ READ! Rock on, Erin Hunter. This is great! This book...so-o suspensful! So Amazing! Soo Well-written! I could go on and on! I hope FireHeart one day becomes FireStar. This book starts off well, and ends with a bang! I cant wait for the rest of the series! Jeeze! Read it! I beg of you! If u dont, you will be missing out on some really good reading!"
2,Good to Go,"Everything I expected and more. I've used it constantly since I bought it and I have no complaints. I thought there was a problem with the heart rate function until I realized that I didn't have the chest strap on, Duhhh. Good product, worth the money."
2,Great Keyboard,"I love my MS 4000 keyboard. It's every thingthat I wanted in a keyboard. It works great.And I haven't had any problems adjusting to thesplit keyboard.I will be buying my wife one also.It's ashame,I am a lazey typist and speller."
2,"LLOYD WEBBERS BEST WORK SINCE ""PHANTOM""","The long awaited new musical from Andrew Lloyd Webber is definetely worth the wait. It is apparant that Andrew Lloyd Webber has returned to writing briliant musicals that stand the test of time against such greats as Les Miserables, Miss Saigon, Cats and Jesus Christ Superstar. Whistle Down the Wind takes you through some of the most beautiful songs I feel Lloyd Webber has ever written. He then propells you into rough, raw and high energy numbers that thrill and captivate. Lloyd Webber's collaberation with Jim Steinman is one such collaboration that mirrors previous collabrations with the legendary Tim Rice. If you are one of those persons sick of hearing the same old Andrew Lloyd Webber style of music, well Whistle Down the Wind is the change you need and you will not be dissapointed."
2,So Much Fun,"This game is great for parties or gatherings with at least four players. I hesitate to purchase games with cards and set questions that you have memorized after only playing a couple of times and therefore becomes unplayable. This game has unlimited playing potential. You select a card from three categories and then try to draw the scene they depict. The results are hysterical. Even though none of us are good at drawing, we had a blast playing this game and even more fun with the incorrect guesses. I highly recommend this!"
2,Satisfied,"Satisfied so far. Was careful this time to incorporate excessive water to avoid indigestion problems that were faced the last time.Looking forward to try the ""Natural"" Whey"
2,Seabiscuit on skates,"I realy like this book, I just started reading it and I'm totally hooked. I'm not a big hockey fan so I think a little bit is lost on me, but this book really draws you into the characters in the traditions of the best sports stories. The whole ""parent of student athlete"" is captured well and that's probably something we all need to be talking more about."
2,Thoroughly enjoyed the whole series,"I just finished reading the final book in this series (The Buck Stops Here). I stumbled upon ""A Penny for Your Thoughts"" recently and then read straight through all 5 books as quickly as I could get my hands on them.The author does an excellent job of communicating emotions and tensions in her writing -- I found myself really ""feeling"" what Callie was feeling. While I often figured out the general gist of mystery long before the end of the book, the journey getting from the first chapter to the last was more enjoyable than trying to figure out the ending."
2,Supentown Swing Machine,I was looking for a less expensive option to the Jigglin' George... the swing machine seems to be doing the job well.
2,Awesome-grabs you from the beginning holds on till the end,"This book has everything you could want in a book. History, romance, adventure...it's all there! I've read and read this book over and over and I get more out of it each time! A GREAT read!!"
2,Get it,"If you like AC/DC, this is a must have. The quality varies, which should be expected given the ""pre-MTV"" timing of many of the clips. Even the the ""MTV"" videos provide little production or theatrics beyond the stage performance that they know best, but you get what you expect, and it is fun to watch the band progress from teens to 40s without losing focus on either subject matter or delivery."
2,Best book ever!,"I got this book for christmas and loved it so much. I look at the cover and thought that I wouldn't like it, but after reading the first page I was hooked. I read this book so quickly and was sad when it was over,but I'm excited to start to read the second one."
2,Wife loved this book,"We are adopting kids from Ethiopia, so I got this for my wife to read. She absolutely loved it. Not sure if it was due to our situation or if she would have loved it anyway. Brings up interesting points about inter-racial adoptions. She is recommending it to our friends and family as a good read."
2,Classic cult movie,"When this was first released I was a child, so that Joan Collins played a role didn't matter.It doesn't either, now. Instead, the scope of the movie's production, it's production values,and the sheer fun of the movie are, well, memorable."
2,This CD tells the story of love,"I loved this CD. It contains everything from crushing ( ""Tell Him"") to breaking up ( ""Immortality""). Also, Celine's voice was great. My favorite song is ""To Love you More"" because the power of Celine's voice just grabbed me."
2,BEST MOVIE OF THE YEAR..........FOR SURE!,"Gladiator is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen in a very long time. It is the kind of movie you don't expect it to be soossoso good, but when you finally are watching it you experience every emotion there is for you to experience in a movie(tension, sadness, happiness and fear). Although it does contain some bloody and intense scenes of war, it gives a message of life that is too special to miss it. How love can conquer all and remain in ones mind forever. Gladiator is a movie that, especially in my experience, the viewer feels like it's living the story. Russell Crowe does a fanstastic job in this movie and well deserves the Best Actor Oscar. I hope Gladiator wins the Best Movie!!! HIGHLY recommended"
2,Excellent Read!,This was my first time reading John Ortberg and I really enjoyed and learned useful techniques to apply in daily life. The author has a good sense of humor and reminds of Max Lucado. I will be reading more books by John Ortberg.
2,Great lounger for a toddler,"My 2 year old daughter loves this chair because she can recline on it and just lounge even in the balcony of our apartment. This chair has not been closed since the day we received it, only to take it to the park or beach. Great buy and quite comfortable with a pillow and a blanket it becomes a quick bed for napping at the beach."
2,I LIKE THIS BOOKS,"i have just bought this book, i began actionscripting about two or three months ago.This book showed me some bad mistakes i made in programming just by doing the first three tutorials(the mouse follower, fire, smoke,fireworks)I'm taking it step by step, but one thing is sure this book is the book for me.it explains things i like and in a way i want to see it explained.In some of the first examples in the book one of the authors explaind emitters, particles movement, waves and amplitude.this are some of the things in the first chapter and i really like likelikelike IT.This book isn't a good book 4 people who don't know nothing of flash(as), but you really don't have to be a flash(as) or math expert to understand a lot of the things.(i havent got through the whole book though, i trying to learn the examples one by one and i want 2 make sure i don't go through it to fast)Very Good book, buying it is definitely no mistake"
2,The best mouse on the market!,This is by far the best mouse on the market to date.Huge accuracy. Clean design and function. Works on Windows AND Linux! Use the USB-to-PS2 conversion plug that comes with the product. ;)
2,Charles in ILL.,"I was pleased with the hinge , but really upset it cost over eleven dollars for shipping. I will not purchase the remaining number of hinges I need."
2,I love to spend time in Jill Tracy's world,"It's rare to find an artist these days who is a true original, but I've never heard anyone quite like Jill Tracy. Her songs are both sexy and scary, dark and decadent, haunting yet hummable, and you won't be able to resist her sultry voice when she suggests you spend an eeeeevil night together. I only wish she would make a follow-up -- I want more!"
2,"A must have!,","I purchased this body pillow In the first few months of my pregnancy. It was a little awkward at first to fall asleep with, but once I got used to it, I had to sleep with it every night. As my pregnant tummy got bigger, it really helped me sleep at night. Especially during months 8 and 9. I actually would sleep well and the entire night. If you want a full nights sleep... Get this pillow!!"
2,bookywooky,A fab read. Very well put together. I love the interaction between all the charactures. Cant put it down. Onto the next part of the series
2,good but get strong weapon last,the game is fun but when you get to the whale you cant find the keyhole. but i hate the fact that you dont get the ultimate weapon till the end of the game witch really sux.
2,One of my favorites,"Being adopted myself (given up by a young one) I got to thinking about my own juno out there and in a movie I was initially appose to seeing found a story I now find very special.Its a story about a bright but goofy teenage girl and her very white bread(not in a racial way, I'm white lol), suburban crush with a craving for tic tacs Bleaker and an ""experiment"" gone terribly wrong. After having sex for the first time in a chair juno finds herself pregnant and being an assertive little thing get in her mind she's gonna do right by the baby and not only put the baby up for adoption but find parents she sees fit. She looks in the Penny Saver and this is the story that goes on from that. Its not a sugar coated story of teen pregnancy but its not a depressing one either. It simply approaches a sensitive topic with humor and along with a great soundtrack and a great cast including Jennifer Garner and Ellen Page."
2,Great pens,"I do a lot of note taking at work. They work great for this purpose.Occasionally, one will not work too well. I have never found a pen that I can't say the same about though"
2,Slow at the beginning but overall very good,"History channel is as good as ever. This 3d blue-ray didn't disappoint either. Didn't want to get a more expensive 3-disc pack History in 3d, which also had some WWII content and Titanic."
2,This story made me think.,"In this book, ""Flight of the Golden Eagle, Tales of the Empty-Handed Masters"" there are many stories in one. This book tells about conflict and how to stop it. It also teaches how to clear your mind, and tells how to get out of habits and how habits are bad. It gives advice or wise sayings. This book has stories of different meanings like song of the life facing death is about a boy who wandered off in the woods and faced death then he sang a childrens lullaby he heard as a little boy to soothe the cat and put her guard down, then he kiaied and then the cat and her cubs walked away. The story I really like is the Beast of the Dark Side. This story made me think. It made me think about the beast inside of me and what animal it is and how it fights. This book will help you clear your mind and help you find the inner you..."
2,"The Ghost (Apparition) of Metal Past, Present & Future","Another fantastic cd from these German Metallers. Classic metal, just great. Keep on rocking over there guys!!!!"
2,gripping,"this is fascinating. the idea sounds rather boring at first, but every time i turned it on again i was gripped by the intensity of what was happening in the lives of the characters. well done!"
2,another good installment,rand's insanity is becoming more prevelant...some interesting plot developments and character creation.
2,Great read,If you enjoy Wing Chun and the history of Wing Chun. You are going to love this book too. Great read.
2,Fabulous shoes,"This shoe is so comfortable. I have this style in three colors (black, navy and cream) and I have yet to wear them once when I did not receive a compliment. They look smart and feel great. Wide heel base makes for easy balance and stride."
2,Good workout,"The workouts are great, though by the time you figure out the routine you are on to the next thing. I do enjoy them. Good thing is they are short, so before I know it the workout is done & I've worked up a sweat. On some of the workouts I really feel it the next day (sculpting), which is great because I was worried that they would be too short & I wouldn't get a good workout. Very glad I bought these."
2,the pondering ROCKS,"With a head like the lead singer from Live, a brother that looks like Buttwheat, and a conglomeration of three smelly back up guys, how can you go wrong with this group? All seriousness aside, this CD is definately their best thus far. I have watched them for the last 5 years grow to become the next best thing since sliced bread. Buy the CD, enjoy the melody, kick back, and have a good time, listening to the only band that will ever make it out of Mt. Pleasant, S.C.. Way to go guys!"
2,"Faltaram alguns classicos, mas o CD é bom!","Gostei muito da incluso de uma verso ao vivo de Eu Sei e Daniel na Cova dos Lees, que ao vivo, é uma das melhores do musicas do Legio. Continuando, teremos Vinte e Nove que é uma bela cano e 1965 que no deixa ninguem parado. O CD cobre quase que toda a carreira do Legio e a gravao é muito boa."
2,Trippy,"Thi album is a great find for those who enjoy the Trippy sounds of the 1960s you also get the novelty song onions onions ,which is totally different from the rest of the cd happy listening."
2,Silpat,Works well. Pleasure to have food not stick to a pan. Will use it a great deal. Giving two more for gift giving.
2,If you've heard 'The Four Seasons' a thousand times...,...make this 1001. It's one of those CD's that makes you smile. She'll do a little variation of a familiar theme and the interpretation she brings to the music is inspired. It shows how her maturity as an artist has allowed her to gain insight into a piece and give it a personal touch. A must for anyone who loves the violin.
2,Ride with Boney,"Boney James! Nothing else needs to be said. Boney, as usual, takes you on special trips with his music. All you have to do is sit down, relax, and be soothed by his version of smooth jazz."
2,This is the Pixie's song Debaser,"Ok you should know that it is a real eye and that's why it looks so real! But it's a mule's eye. Made with Salvador Dali this is one cool movie, based on dreams they's had and some misreadings of Freud and I think a few French cinematic puns...it still has the power to shock. Land without Bread....done in the clinical form of some kind of documentary you tour the Hurdas provence of Spain which had only just been opened up to the rest of the world and is so poor that some peoplel have never seen bread. Is it a black comedy? Should you laugh or cry or both. This relly is worth a look."
2,Right And Tight A/C Cover...,Want something inexpensive and protective to cover your A/C in the fall and winter?This is it.Good price and excellent shipping...can't beat it.
2,"Cool, terrific, but some misprintings.",Listen! i had read only chapter 5 and 9. but i believe the value of this book is the same as your money.
2,my go-to watch,"This is the watch I wear most often. I've had it for about 16 years, and in all that time I've had precisely 0 problems. Now and then the battery runs out; otherwise it just keeps ticking. It's two-tone, so you can match it very easily with different colors, and the style is simple yet elegant enough that you can wear it with anything from jeans to a business suit. I expect it to last for decades."
2,Doesn't seem like a legit Built case,"There are certain things (ex. the logo looks unfinished & fake) that make it seem like this is not a real Built laptop case. The one I received doesn't look like the one in the description (ex. dot pattern is different, zipper color is wrong). This made me question whether if the questionable case's material would protect my work laptop but I've used it for a couple of weeks and it seems ok, haven't seen any major problems yet. My recommendation is to pay the extra few bucks to buy directly from Built because the $15 is worth not having to wonder if this will protect your $500+ laptop."
2,Staff Members Can Build Credibility with Line Management,"Speed to Market provides a truly impressive set of lessons guaranteed to reduce customer wait time 75% or more. Not only of value to line management, this easy-to-comprehend book provides any staff member with the knowledge needed to establish credibility with management while making a strategic contribution to their organization. As President of Human Resource Professionals, I am always seeking good information to enhance my HR consulting with an understanding of my client's overall business opportunities. Read this book now! Your customer is waiting!"
2,Little feather's woman !!!,This book was one of the best books I've ever had the pleasure of reading ....it hooked you from begining to end. I would highly suggest that anyone who loves a good heart warming romance novel pick this book up .....You won't regret it.
2,"Not what I expected, but certainly not bad.","What I expected to hear was various gothic bands administer the atomic drop to various Christmas songs (and one Chanukah song). Some of the songs fulfill that expectation. A lot of them are just good solid renditions of the original songs (""A Winter Wassail"", by Faith and the Muse, is a good example of this), which are probably much funnier if you're familiar with more of the band's own miusic. All told, a solid album, but not exactly what I had in mind."
2,with no expectations,"I'd never read Elizabeth George. Lynley? Havers? Quien es?My mom, however, is a fan. We read What Came Before He Shot Her at the same time, checking in via telephone about our progress and reactions. She hated it and informed me often that it wasn't typical of George's work. Me? I loved it. Her use of dramatic foreshadowing is quite powerful, and her dialogue is spot on. I don't read many classical mysteries, and this was not one. But I've got to stand up and cheer for Elizabeth George's writing style!"
2,Walt Disney's Fantasia - Remastered Soundtrack,"Cystal clear, with more vibrance and depth than I can remember ever hearing all the years I've been listening to this work. A wonderful treat for the ears."
2,Great product,"I have many sizes and shapes in these Pyrex bowls. The best part is the vent on top so you can put food in the microwave without it splattering all over. They are better than plastic (health-wise), and last forever. Thanks!"
2,Absolutely the Best in the Universe!,"Every song is equally sensually fantastic; Darren and Daniel and their group are far superior to anyone else around; the songs emit feelings, sentiment and universal language."
2,An Occult Masterwork,"This unusual book, which many Crowley readers don't even know exists, highlights the author's unique genius. In many respects, Crowley's is a perfectly legitimate, sturdy translation of the ancient Chinese wisdom book. Yet Crowley is able to add just the right wrinkle to its words to subtly infuse it with his ""do what thou wilt"" philosophy. I wouldn't advise making this version the only Tao Te Ching translation on your shelf -- for that look to Jonathan Star and some of the other master translators. But alongside the existing Tao literature, this is a fascinating and masterful supplement. For Crowley readers, it is a must. And due to its accessibility, this work may even be a good introduction to the nature of Crowley himself. In any case, it shows his intellectual and artistic mastery, not only of occult and esoteric wisdom, but also of poetic form and interpretive art."
2,Rare CD,"I couldn't find any copies of this CD ""new"" so I had to buy a used one... There are a lot of great songs on there, and I would strongly suggest looking at the MP3 downloads on Amazon if you can't find the physical CD."
2,The hinge on which all else turns,"this is the doctrine which, said luther, all else turns. This was luther's finest diatribe (he said he thought more clearly in a state of anger). luther fought tooth and nail with rome's representative, disiderus erasmus. These two historical giants go toe to toe and Scripture to Scripture, as luther maintained that free will ""was a fiction without a name."" The bondage of the will is the cornerstone of reformation theology and should be read by all christians who wonder why luther and calvin fought so hard for it."
2,Rose y Ormandy grandiosos...,"Leonard Rose es un chelista de excepcion y brilla como nunca en este conjunto increible de obras para solista y orquesta.El concierto para cello de Lalo es genial, una obra simple pero se agradece en virtud de sus delicadas melodias y por acercarnos al mundo del violonchelo. Varioaciones sobre un tema rococó es una de mis piezas preferidas, delicada, creativa y exquisita, es un conjunto de bellos momentos, de pequeñas perlas para disfrutar, sencillamente genial.Otro gran momento en esta seleccion es la rapsodia Schlomo de Block, es patriotica si se puede decir, pero mas aun religiosa, es sublime, es intensa, es brillante, verdaderamente una bella pieza musical.Faure cierra el conjunto con su sutil y popular Elegie, es una obra sencilla, luminosa y quizas sentimental, hermosa.La orquesta de Filadelfia suena como siempre perfecta y Ormandy al mando de todos nos demuestra su capacidad para acompañar al solista y deslumbrar con su orquesta todo al mismo tiempo."
2,Must Have for Serious Biblical Students,"This book is a must for anyone who truly wants to understand the depth of the Bible. It is extremely detailed, but in the end you are only left with one choice after all of the options are examined. Israel and the covenants must be treated appropriately and Dr. Fruchtenbaum does that. This is a great defense of Dispensationalism."
2,Black Beauty,I sent this as a gift to my grandchildren the Toyko so I really can't evaluate it. The service was good. The product came quickly and was in very good shape.
2,Praise Be To The Lord,"yep...these guys are defiately a christain band. That doesn't stop their music from being decent though. ""Closure"" and ""An Evening With El Diablo"" are pretty good actually. The only way you can tell they're christian is if you really listen...""Grab Thy Hand"" is a dead giveaway...but who cares?? This cd is great background music and moshing music if you don't have anything harder on hand. I would recommend this to younger kids who weren't around during the whole RATM and NIN age and have no recollection of nu metal before all the poop bands ruined it."
2,This is the downrod you've been looking for.,"It's a downrod. It does exactly what it's supposed to do. It's white. It's 12 inches. It's designed for Hunter fans. If you've got a Hunter fan and need a 12 inch white downrod, this is the product for you."
2,Good product,I was impressed with the speed and efficiency of the seller. The pump installed easily and fit like the original. I have been using it for a moth and have found no issues. Good Job
2,Great and heart touching,Well produced. Wonderful true story. Made to be watched again and again. For ALL AGES. Family movie. See it. Feel the love
2,Great for the price!,"I bought this for doing high school sports on the radio. It was everything that I hoped it would be. It fits comfortable on the head and it picks up background noise very well (sometimes too well) to give the ""being there"" feeling for the listener. The long cord helps for moving around to be able see and call the action."
2,MORE THAN ENOUGH FOR THE EVERYDAY USER,"I started out with a Palm III, switched to a handheld PC and am now back with the Palm V. For the everyday person it's more than enough. I didn't buy it to play games with - I bought it to stay organized. The extreme ease of use is wonderful and syncing to your PC is a breeze. Anybody that needs more than this needs a handheld PC (Which have their own combersome problems!) I have found the OS platform with the Palm V much easier to sync with my desktop - especially with WindowsNT. Too many problems connecting with WindowsCE. The Palm V has far exceeded my needs and is perfect for the everyday user looking for a palm organizer that is just that, an organizer and 24hr assistant."
2,Poems,If you are a literary nerd of poems this is great a compilation of the some of the best works. Enjoy the read
2,Madman Genius,"Madman Across The Water completed a trilogy of albums (including Elton John & Tumbleweed Connection) that rank right up there in rock history. Madman Across The Water's songs are more like short stories. The writing is so detailed and precise and the music is sprawling and thematic. ""Tiny Dancer"" is a beautiful song and has experienced a rebirth with its inclusion in Almost Famous. ""Levon"" is a classic and the title track is a haunting piece. ""Indian Sunset"" has the Old West sound that mimes the sound of Tumbleweed Connection. ""Holiday Inn"" is a tale of life on the road and ""Goodbye"" is an epilogue to the album."
2,"Just a ""GOOD"" phone","When I first bought this phone, I thought it would be the last one I bought because it had every feature that I wanted. However, two family members also bought this phone and after a month one of the batteries needed to be replaced. Then my battery need replaced. Also, good advice, be careful on the charging end on the phone because if the charger is not place in properly and exact, it will mess up the whole charging system."
2,Great leadership training reference!,We recently used this as a reference for supervisor training -- the book provided excellent material to facilitate a round-table discussion. The summary at the end of each chapter provides good focal points for participants. I would highly recommend it.
2,Brilliant!,Haven't seen a program this good in years. Absolutely brilliant. I love it. Can't wait for the next season. Bravo!
2,Great workshop heat,"I bought this heater for my garage woodworking hobby shop back in 1996. This workshop was a 2-1/2 car detached garage with insulation on the underside of the roof - meaning there was ALOT of cubic feet in that building to heat on cold Indiana winter nights. Although the building was only insulated with r-11 fiberglass, there were days when it was 20 degrees or less outside and I was working in a longsleeved t-shirt and jeans in my workshop. I found that on a full tank of fuel this heater would go for about 8-9 hours. I wish that capacity was double that, but oh well.The only serious downsides to this thing in my book stem from the nature of kerosene heat and not the heater itself. No matter how clean the fuel is, kerosene heat inevitable produces a smell. It was fine in a workshop but the few times I brought this thing into the house it smelled pretty bad...If you are looking for kerosene heat though, this is a quality model that can be had at a pretty good price."
2,Invaluable,"Quotebooks are invaluable for writers--good quotebooks. This is one of my favorites, because it is indexed by specific topics, not general ones and it has a good mix of Christian and secular authors.Many quotebooks offer a lot and then when you get them you'll find the same tired, old rehashed quotes in your other ones. Plus it is thick. Add this to your library at once!!"
2,Excellent! But slightly unstable,"For the basics, Toshiba's e310 Pocket PC is excellent. Using the oh-so-familiar Windows operating system, navigation and programs are seemlessly integrated with your desktop. It is quite easy to download photos and games. The size is perfect -- not too small, not too large.The Pocket PC has several options for writing, including free style, letter recognizer, and the keyboard. It takes a bit of practice to use the ""handwriting"" styles. The keyboard is a reliable standby.On the down side, the system occasionally gets stuck and requires rebooting, especially when the battery begins to run low. This can be annoying, especially if you are in the middle of something. Also, the screen size is a bit small to properly use Excel or Internet Explorer.Overall, I enjoy my Pocket PC and am satisfied with my purchase."
2,Real country from Russia,"If you've grown weary of music that you can't tell is country or not, Bering Strait might be just what you are looking for. Excellent vocal and instrumental country music. ""Bering Strait"" (track 10) is an instrumental tract that fully showcases the musical ability of the group. ""Parushka-Paranya"" (cut 11) doesn't let you forget that this blue-grass side of country group is really from Russia. There is not a track I didn't like (unusual for me). Not perfect - I think the tracts could have been organized on the disk - but an truly outstanding first effort from a new group, none the less. Be sure and watch the trailer from the documentary ""The Ballad of Bering Strait"". I also particularly enjoyed the video extra of ""Bering Strait"" and ""Jagged Edge of a Broken Heart""."
2,"Toto, Here We Go Again.....","If you're new to Rainbow or a casual fan, ""Rainbow - On Stage"" is probably a better bet for you. However for fans, like myself, that have worn that release out, this is great stuff. Nicely packaged and well recorded.It's a somewhatlonger, un-edited ""On Stage"". But the quality is right there. On this release, and the other two Deutschland Tournee cd's, I honestly couldn't tell you which is the best, as they are all very similar. But they have just enough differences to warrant listening to each. The fans singing ""Rit-chie Black-more"" at the beginning of Dusseldorf is quite funny. Bottom line, a great set of cd's, just depends on what you're looking for price wise. Blackmore always delivers, so I have no complaints here."
2,amazing,"I assumed this would be another text book style read consisting of sterile,bare bones info. I was very pleasantly surprised. This book is increadible. It reads like a novel and yet the info is present in every sentence. The author is clearly beyond knowledgable about the topic. I would recommend this book to anyone . Truely amazing!"
2,Works just fine ...,"Not much to say, opened the package and plugged it in. Could not be easier and works as expected. Just like I like it!"
2,Nothing that hasn't already been seen,"I'm a big fan of any book on the Kennedy's but I found this book to be a let down. Other than a handful of photos of her as a child, there's nothing in this book that hasn't already been published. The only good thing about it is that all of the photos are in one book. I really liked JFK: A life in pictures, which is wonderful but I was disappointed by this book."
2,Swoosh!,"That's the sound the net makes!My daughter wanted this for her bday. (she just turned 16) as one of her gifts. She seems to be very pleased with it but I think it's much better suited for little ones. If she or my son were much younger, they would definitely have loved this item!"
2,James P. Sullivan,James P. Sullivan along with Mike Wazowski are my favorite characters in the Monsters Inc movie and those are the two figures that I enjoy playing. I'm a little scared of this big guy but I still think that he is my partner.
2,WHAT,"I must say that this album still ranks in my favorite of all time list. Though not as perfect as Indulgence, this cd is very close. The only problem with it is a bit of a lackluster production as that of Indulgence. But songs like Welcome Wagon, Irrational, Family Circus, Puzzled and the devastating Sin Eater Are classics in the nastiest sense. Only a couple of minor fillers in Powerslam and Horizertical (instrumental) to Slightly disappoint, but whatever. Some of these riffs are just awesome and, of course, the great delivery of Nasty Ronnie make it essential. To bad they suffered an early death because they were the best of the crop. R.I.P!"
2,A great library addition!,"This is my all-time favorite book. My copy is so worn I have to use a rubber band to keep it together. It is a great story about making the best of things, pretending to be who you are not and ultimately, coming to terms with the truth - and the freedom that that brings! I loved every single character!"
2,Great all-around healer!!!,This is a great all-around healer! The product came on time. The company is great. You can even dilute this product with water and give to your dogs.
2,Exciting reading,A very well written history of economic policy - or should I say philosophy - since the great depression. The one of 1929/30. It ends with the 'triumph' of neoliberalism in the early 1990s; that makes the authors look a bit out of inc after the most recent world economic crisis (2008). But understanding how we came from 1930s to 1980s is very worthwhile to understand how we came from 1980 to 2008. 1st class opportunity to learn something from history...
2,Pizzazz's More Than Pizza!,"I bought this for my husband for Christmas. He loves it! Don't have to preheat the oven and the Pizza comes out awesome. We also have cooked appetizers on it such as chicken wings, egg rolls and other frozen snacks. They turned out perfect too! Love it!"
2,Red Skelton is the best!,This is not the greatest Red Skelton but it is still very entertaining. Red is great as Clem Kadiddlehopper and is always great when telling his jokes. It's always a barrel of laughs with good old Red Skelton.
2,Annie,"History again is very important in life. San Quentin was quite a show. Peison life is not something anyone should want to experience. But of course, bcause of the era many men n women felt desperate. The movie shows manipulation from cellmates, guards, and how honesty with integrity has no meaning. Humphrey Bogart was a fine man in his time. I am glad to have met him through the screen."
2,Great Book,"I love this author, and the book. I got my book when it was suppose to get here and my students are loving it."
2,"Beautiful, tragic and real..just like death!","Just amazing. Grabbed a copy of this pretty cheap, I mean as cheap as they get, and I believe I like his second one better, but I just had to have it. You can find most of the photos as reference in other volumes and articles, but if you can grab a copy without a bank loan, DO IT!"
2,nicely read,Unabridged. The discs have good sound quality. The reader has pleasant reading voice and did excellently with the pronunciation of the specialized vocabulary.
2,Amazing service & an awesome item!,"I purchased this item yesterday as a gift for my husband. It arrived today, in perfect condition. The daggers are gorgeous, and he absolutely loves them! Excellent craftsmanship, and the detail on the dragons is to die for. The only issue we've had with it is that the mounting holes on the plaque are not even, so the daggers sit a bit lop-sided, but all in all, a great purchase for the price! We will be ordering from this seller again, and we'll recommend them to other collectors as well. Thank you for the excellent service!"
2,Check this band out....,"Silent Poets are almost completely unknown over here, which i find almost criminal. although this isn't their best work (that would be To Come or For Nothing), it is still a beautiful score to what I assume was Issey Miyake's fashion show. it showcases ambient versions of a couple of SP's classics (Someday, Talk Is Toy). The book that accompanies is very nice, showcasing some of Miyake's creations that are very much eye candy. Check out the proper Japan import versions of To Come (don't get the version which has a red cover, they're just remixes) for their best material."
2,HEARTFELT,"This movie was recommended to me and it was the best romance drama that I have ever seen. It had me crying, & laughing. I watched it 4 times in 2 days.I loved it!!!"
2,"""Rude Boy"" DVD","DVD movie came timely, I had no problem with it, no scratches.This is an adult action movie, restricted for children."
2,GPS Mount,"This thing is great. No more having to wipe the windshield off to remove the ""suction ring""It stays in place easily and is easy to put away."
2,"Great Season, Kids love it","I love blu-ray, but it does take a LONG time to load. More than just a normal disc, which is sometimes annoying. However, the season is good. My 10 year old boy loves it."
2,Charming Adventure,"I strongly suggest you to read this book. She happens to be your funny, adventurer, wisdom seeker friend who shares a charming journey with you."
2,Funny and Raw,"I was intrigued by the title so I bought this and I have to say that the first half was pretty quirky and funny and I thought it would just be a fluffy movie about dating but the second half was raw and had alot of intense emotion and the lead character's insecurieties made me relate to her. I thought all the actors gave solid preformances but I loved Jules & Vicki's friendship the best and the dialogue was really snappy and witty. Overall, totally enjoyable!"
2,FINALLY! - PURE 80's FARE!,"Engaging, heartwarming and intelligent film that makes you think ""What If?"". Saw this when it opened and have liked it ever since but this DVD release was way overdue. Have watched in on laserdisc many times. Watch this, ""Wargames"" and ""The Manhattan Project"" for pure eighties escapism!"
2,An excellent book about an obscure subject,"When thinking about British fighters of WWII, the Spitfire and Hurricane naturally come to mind first. But the British used other fighters, one of which was the Gloster Gladiator. A fabric-covered biplane, the Gladiator was an anachronism by 1939. Yet it served well during the early part of the war, not only in the RAF, but also with the Royal Navy and Australian, South African, Finnish, Swedish, Greek, Belgian, Norwegian and Chinese air forces.Author Andrew Thomas clearly did a tremendous amount of research for the book, including interviews with surviving pilots. The color profiles and and photographs are excellent. My only minor quibble with the book is that it would have been improved with a short description of the aircraft itself and its versions."
2,Cheaper at Walmart,"I purchased this toy for Christmas from Amazon for under $20, since then the price online has gone up. But I was just searching for the accessory pack and came across a deal at Walmart that includes 4 books and the reader for only $23.00... so I'm alittle disappointed since I paid another $20 for the extra books. But it's already wrapped and it's too much of a hassle now. I haven't given the gift to my 41/2 year old daughter yet, but she'll love it. It is so simplistic and the sound quality is great. The stories are 20 pages or so and there is a small chip embedded into the paper pages so that the reader can determine which page you are on. It's pretty neat, I had fun just flipping the pages! She loves to pretend to read and loves to be read to so I think this is a great gift."
2,"Light, but held my interest","This book was very easy to read and had characters that were interesting to follow. The way the victim got her revenge was clever. I would say, some parts were boring (too much detail), whereas some parts did not fill in enough details. Like why, was the 23 year old perfect man so into brutalizing women? They never explained and said he loved his mother"
2,Works well Except.....,"Works well Except the stupid plugs. one on each side. they LOVE to pop out no matter how tight I apply them. Using water for the weight and every use, one side has popped out. I have finally lost one and am not looking for a replacement."
2,Great Video,I love this video. It is great for firming and toning while pregnant and can be used in addition to a moderate exercise routine.
2,Great Bag.,"Arrived on time and intact. It has a sturdy, quality feel. Has shoulder straps and enough pockets for sheet music and cords. It's thick enough to travel around without worrying that your fine instruments will be dinged or scratched. Well done."
2,One of my favorite movies,"I rented this recently on Netflix, and immediately came to Amazon to purchase it. This is one of those movies that you should own. It is so entertaining. I wouldn't recommend it for kids...obviously! But if you like a mind-bending movie, buy this."
2,great,this is a great product. it arrived on time. the items were not broken or damaged. i am very pleased with it. i would recomment it to a friend
2,Listening Hearts: Discerning Call in Community,"This book was recommended by my spiritual advisor. I was struggling with my call as a deacon. This book helped me look at the whole picture, not just a call in ministry, but a call in one's life. It clarified for me many things and I was able to see clearly the path to which I have been guided. It was also very helpful in how to help others discern their call."
2,Phyllis Whitney Writes A Romantic-Suspense-A-Licious Novel!,"Absolutely a delicious read! From beginning to end, Woman Without A Past grabbed the reader into a suspense filled, mystery personified read that could not be put down. From adoption to murder, this novel portrayed the feeling of needing to connect to the biological past that anyone that was adopted would feel, and intertwined between all the chaotic emotions associated with that quest alone, were unsolved murders and mayhem, a little madness, and a touch of romance.Romantic Suspense at its best!"
2,One of the Best,This program will take time off your learning. The cassette version is actually very useful when it comes to rewinding and pausing.Learn Italian the Fast and Fun Way with Cassettes
2,Amazing!,It's a little pricey but it makes the water crystal clear (my municipal source feeds us brown water) and the water tastes fresh (very similar to bottled water).
2,Okay. Now I think they've got their feet back under them.,"This was a great episode--the story was interesting, and imaginative; it was spooky enough, and the gore was just within the limits of the story witout going overboard. The sub-plot with Monroe and the resurfacing of a key character from last season add some deliscious complication. They're back to form with this one."
2,Great Performances of the Grieg and Schumann Piano Concertos,"I strongly commend Philips for reissuing these exceptional recordings of the Grieg and Schumann Piano Concertos. Kovacevich's fiery, dramatic performances of each score are filled with ample passion coupled with excellent technical skills at the keyboard. Without question, these are among the most exciting performances I have heard of either concerto. Sir Colin Davis and the BBC Symphony Orchestra are admirable partners with Kovacevich. The sound quality is quite good with Philips' lastest image bit digital remastering."
2,MY DAUGHTER LOVES THIS MOVIE...,"THIS MOVIE IS GREAT, THIS IS ONE OF HER FAVORITES, SHE LOVES APPLE DUMPLING TAKING CARE OF BABY STRAWBERRY."
2,JAG,"I always watched the show on tv and enjoyed it. Theres nothing I needed to know before I purchased it except the price. David James Elliot is a very handsome guy and I enjoyed following the stories from a pilot to a JAG lawyer and back again. The stories are very interesting along with some of the regular characters in the show. It has a little of everything action,romance and current military actions stories.JAG (Judge Advocate General): The Ninth SeasonI highly recommend the entire series."
2,Excellent read! Recommend for high school student read.,This book basically is quite simple in structure and features no hard core mathematical concepts of any sort. Thorne created the book so that even the most ambiguous of concepts concerning the esoteric field of physics can be understood by almost anyone. As a high school student I highly recommend this book to those who have plenty of time to spare and love to delve into the history relativistic theory and it's presumptions in our 4 dimension universe. All in all it's worth your money and it's non condescending.
2,Interesting writer,"K. Laurence Stapleton was a professor of English at Bryn Mawr College. For 46 years she taught poetry, creative writing, literary criticism and poticial science. She also wrote six books of poetry, criticism and political thought. She was known as Laurence, a family name, and died in 1998 at age 86. A graduate of Smith College, Stapleton also did grad work at the London School of Economics and Political Science. She wrote this book on ""the universal idea of justice"". ""The debate over this concept is a kind of focus for the opposition between democratic and totalitarian beliefs."""
2,"All day, every day...","I literally listened to this CD all day long for an average of 3 days a week (some weeks not at all, sometimes the entire week) for 5 months. I was a Walt Disney World College Program Merchandise Hostess in Adventureland (Hi Pirates!), and in Island Supply, they loop this to play in the store. I was working 6-8 hour days in this side of Adventureland for about half of my time in Orlando (the other half was in the Pirates of the Caribbean side and on Main Street USA). In my opinion, this is the best soundtrack you will hear in the park for listening to over and over again. There were days when I got sick of whatever calypso stuff they were playing in the Pirates stores (suprisingly, they don't play Yo Ho! all day...), and there were days that I got sick of hearing the parade soundtrack, but I don't actually remember getting sick of listening to this soundtrack."
2,Excellent for reading out-loud to a young audience,"At this point I have read a large number of fantasy books to my young children (ages 3-7). The Rowan series stands out as above-average for out-loud reading to that age group:- The vocabulary was well suited to my listener(s) ages (with just enough advanced words to increase their vocabulary, but not so many that they lose the ability/interest to follow the story);- There was little violence, but plenty of suspense and monsters- The repetition of plot elements between books (mentioned as a negative in previous reviews) can be used as a tool to prompt young listeners into critical thinking and analysisIf you are a parent looking to read to your children, take a look at this series."
2,great product,"i had heard a lot of bs about this product, its a great product. turns on and off automatically. you can barely hear the fan"
2,a moving book -- moving in more ways than one,"This is one of my favorite books -- flip the pages and you see a cheerful girl signing in ASL -- ""My heart is smiling. Why?"" It follows the ASL grammatical format (using a rhetorical question). Turn the book over and flip it the other way, and there's the answer. There are also other small pictures in the margins which ""move"" when you flip the pages.... a flashing light showing an incoming TTY call, then the TTY message itself; a heart puzzle being wrapped; a mouth growing and aging from a baby's toothless smile to an old person's toothless wrinkled smile."
2,Great for preschool and for early readers,"My daughters both loved this book when they were three, but even more at five when they could read it to me. Written so they can memorize many stories while getting the basic stories of the bible across. Fantastic introductory book. Give it to your god children!"
2,i don't even have the albulm and i know its a beast,"i don't even own the fricken albulm and i can just tell its awesome. as soon as i heard i dont wanna be i knew this kid was goin to be awesome, so i made 1 of my friends buy it. trust me. buy the cd."
2,A Lovely Film,"I saw this movie on the big screen at its original release and found it charming, but I must admit it was not my favorite Bette Davis performance, so much had come before it showing Davis at her exceptional best. Now, these many years later, I have a greater appreciation for her portrayal here and I find that I am quite pleasantly surprised at her work. There is a subtle revelation of who Apple Annie really is that is quite beautiful to see. Her performance is so reserved that she seems to give the picture away to her co-stars, but what is actually happening is a remarkably intelligent development of character that only adds to Davis' range as an actor. She is, in a word, superb. All the actors are wonderfully cast in this truly delightful gem of a Capra film. For Davis, an excellent cast and the overall high production standards of this movie - 5 stars."
2,One of the great live albums.,One of the great live albums. Such fun to listen to and you can tell they had fun making it. I totally recommend buying both the CD and DVD of this performance. 5 stars!!!
2,Worth your $100,"It's no nonsense. The eye relief is as advertised. The Dusk and Dawn is clear and bright.I am not shooting exotic Africian wildlife, so spending hundreds didn't make sense to me, although I would have no issues taking it to knockdown a trophy white tail.I really can't see you will be dissapointed. Save your money from the Leupolds, et al, and get more ammo!"
2,Kauai Cookbook (used),We purchased three used copies for members of the family. Sellers were associated with Amazon. These cookbooks help the novice prepare Hawaiian/Asian foods from Hawaii and the island of Kauai. A great book!
2,"""Coffee, Cigarettes and ... Chocolate.""","Blake Fraina joins a list of authors I would read anytime, keeping company with Charles de Lint, Patricia A. McKillip, et al. Fraina writes in the style of an updated urban fairytale - stitching myth and reality into the lives of real people.Fraina carefully weaves a purposeful rearrangement of time and place to slowly unfold his musician, Jimmy, whose life is a sum of all of its experiences. All of the characters in KING OF CATS strongly step from the pages - each with his/her own crisp personality and more specifically, their own needs and history.As when I read Charles de Lint's DREAMS UNDERFOOT, I avoided reaching the end of the book, not wanting to leave the characters behind. I fell in love with Jimmy, Adam, Amy ... and hope to see their futures and pasts appear again in Fraina's writing."
2,danger in the shadows,"Great read, I really enjoyed the details with all the action and suspense. I also really liked the drops of christianity, I have already looked for more books by this author. Take the time out to read this book you will be glad you did."
2,major,"The Knife is this great electronic band from Sweden. They are very much an electro band. They remind me of Kraftwerk and John Foxx. The vocals are whispered. They float over keyboards lines. A great example is the song ""Silent Shout."" Some other songs have massive beats and more hiphop like vocals. This is a strong album. For more electronic music, this is something to check out."
2,The Enemy,"The audio book was fine, but this is the 2nd time I've ordered with amazon and the 2nd time I had a problem. I was sent 2 books, when I returned one of them you didn't return the shipping fees. I didn't order 2 books.Joyce"
2,K & M Trumpet Stand KC- It's just AWESOME,"I Bough this trumpet stand and I love it, great price and awesome quality!!. They delivered it in less then 2 days I was so happy. I would defenetly recommend buying it, perfect stability with the five legs, portable."
2,Recommendable to others suffering this loss.,"As an Ordained Animal Chaplain, I work with many families (especially children),and adults whose only campanion dies. Each person expresses grief differently,and it warms my heart to be able to help them."
2,works great,"works just fine, i am a car transporter and this is the box. Easy to carry and plenty of starting power."
2,The Best of Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon!,"In my opinion, this is THE best collection of episodes of sailor moon that there will ever be. The plot is great, the animation is great(in most of the episodes.) The story has it's great twists and turns, making the show unpredictable and mysterious. It shows the remaining 3 members of the Witches 5, and then it uncovers the mysteries of hotaru. it has it happy moments, its sad moments, and it's just brilliant work. This is a must see, and i highly suggest it!!"
2,A laid back album with a cool grove !,"Every girl in TLC has more girl power than all the Spice Girls together. And on this album it really shows. It is both sensual, ruff and very cool. The best CD at my house. Crazy Sexy Cool still playin'."
2,"""Absolutely priceless"" -- Khachaturian conducts the love duet from Spartacus","I was thrilled to find a digital remastering of this 1962 masterpiece by Aram Khachaturian to replace my old, worn out tape that I played to death. I especially recommend the ""Adagio of Spartacus and Phrygia."" This stunning pas de deux is a romantic love duet that is ethereal and noble and readily transports the listener to another, more serene place. The fact that the recording features the composer of the work, Aram Khachaturian (1903-1978) as conducter makes it a remarkable treasure. As another reviewer noted, the CD idoes not contain the full Spartacus or Gayaneh ballets but excerpts of both. Unless you are a purist and must have the total works, it is a worthwhile investment especially as it gives an excellent sampling of the best parts of the two ballets. And the treatment comes directly from the source...the composer of the work. What could be better."
2,Mystic Warrior - Spiritual Technology at its best!,Mystic Warrior teaches spiritual principles in a fun way that I was able to relate to my real world experiences. It's a great modern day adventure story about an entrepreneur with business challenges who uses his spiritual toolkit to persevere. It reminded me that I need to open my spiritual toolkit more often when I feel challenged in my business and personal life. I enjoyed reading the book Mystic Warrior very much and I highly recommend it.
2,Addy Saves the Day,"The book was the older version, which was fine, but the first photo was of the newer print. I believe the photos were of all printed versions; however, it was somewhat confusing to know which one you were getting. I was fine with the white cover because we had the similar books already and it made a complete set, but it would have been nice to know up front that we were completing what we already had. Otherwise, very happy with our purchase."
2,Can't go wrong,Can't go wrong with Beverly Louis. Gripping from beginning to end! I have enjoyed every book of hers I have read.
2,Logitech got it right!,"I bought this webcam (hassle-free packaging) for use with Skype. I've owned it for about a year now. It has worked very well in all lighting conditions, was quick and painless to set up, has been compatible with all software i've tried, and best of all - it has made keeping in touch with family and friends easier and more entertaining!At the time of purchase, it was just $40 (after $20 Mail-in-Rebate.) An absolute steal. Couple that with Amazon's quick shipping and i'll say that i'm completely satisfied with my purchase; it's been a wonderful product and i wouldn't hesitate to buy the Webcam Pro 9000 over again if i were in the market for a new cam. Thanks, Logitech and Amazon!"
2,"Pentax strap FK for ZX-7, ZX-30, and actually, most other Pentax single lens reflex camera bodies, for that matter.",A comfortable strap made by Pentax for just about any Pentax SLR camera body. Attached easily (done it many times) it adjusts in length to any user's liking.
2,Didn't Break on 230/240 v,"I use regular 110v plugs (with 230v running through them) to hook up my computer systems, to save the hassle of buying new plugs for each one. I accidentally plugged it into one of those plugs and have used it a dozen times since without it breaking. As always ymmv but just thought I would let people know in case they were curious, as it is only rated for 110v"
2,Great Speakers,"I have owned two sets of these speakers and I plan to buy a spare set for when these wear out. Great sound, perfect balance, tone control, and an ear phone jack. These are hard to beat."
2,Excellent book for kids.,"I had this book as a kid, and as I recall, it was super-fascinating, yet pretty blunt about the facts we face in today's world. Definitely kid-appropriate, and a great buy for any younger relative with any inclination toward science, social science, or simply being educated."
2,rediscovered,"Going through my stacks of cds, I came across a copy of SDRE's Diary. Never listened to it, and was pleasantly surprised that...they're good! Looked up the cd on Amazon and whispered to myself - oh, so that's what emo's supposed to be. I guess... I like emo then. Maybe =D"
2,Entertaining and moving story of a very modern family,"This is one of those modern, unconventional California families: two lesbian moms who have given birth to a son and daughter by way of a sperm donor, whom the kids choose to meet when they get old enough to do so. Conflicts ensue as the couple's problems surface with a vengeance, one partner has a fling with the donor daddy, and the kids are caught up in the turmoil.The actors turn in very strong performances here, and the script and direction are good as well. It is not suitable for everyone; the very traditional or strictly religious will be put off by the lovemaking between the women, although it is not graphic; and by the whole arrangement of their family. Others, though, may enjoy it."
2,crochet basics,Very pleased to get this book which arrived in good order and was priced competitively. Your service is appreciated Thanks.
2,Valuable contribution,"An interesting book by a respected sociologist.The previous reviewer engaged in more of an ad hominem attack than a review because he, apparently, dislikes qualitative approaches to sociology (and structural-functionalism in particular). He reviewed a discipline and methodology rather than this book, and used his review to sell his own book.Moreover, he didn't even get the name of the school right. It is the University of Chicago, which would surely be known by any reputable sociologist as it is known for founding the enormously influential school of thought known as ""the Chicago School"" in the 1930s.Sexual organizations and structures in urban environments are notoriously inaccessible to statisticians, and Laumann's subjective, qualitative approach is very appropriate in this book."
2,"Not so Fundamental, but realistic","If you have read any of Neale's previous works you will recognize many excerpts. However they are definitely needed in this somewhat new twist to his usual style. The central theme of this book is to (Wishful thinking) put down the traditional, not completely, but as to accept one another in a new revelation that God is your God, Mine is Mine, I wont moleste you for that and you accept me for what I believe. Not really a new idea but I give Neale 5 stars as a contributor to wishing peace in a time of turmoil. The absolute best book I have read on this very attempt is SB: 1 or God By Karl Maddox, Very good book."
2,Good for the price,"I have a Canon Powershot A510. I just use it as a point and shoot, I dont use the settings or do anything advanced. I bought this because my last SD card corrupted when I took a picture and switched over too fast to view it. This price was good on this, but its a little slow."
2,Sad but inspiring,Sad but inspiring to see how the children of parents who chose to be homeless and take their children on this journey found their way out of this life style.
2,these are freaking awesome!,"These arch supports are thin, so they don't add a ridiculous inches to your height, but they are thick enough to give great cushioning and thorough support.My favorite shoes are Chuck Taylor high-tops by Converse. They feel great - but can be fatiguing after lengthy walking - these arch supports by Dr. Scholl make it possible for me to wear my Chuck Taylors all day long.They are also great for making my dress shoes comfortable when I'm at work."
2,A very well written book,This book is written by a Mountain resquer and is so full of information you will want it in youre library for future refrence and continue to read it so you can keep absorbing information out of this book.
2,Excellent Lucille Ball is so funny!,Lucille Ball is amazingly funny!She captures every moment with her looks sounds and It would be nice to see her in colour!
2,Over-the-top fun!,"Making fun of Hollywood isn't new. There are a lot of TV shows and movies that do it. Heck, Kathy Griffin is making a career out of it. But this is the first time I've seen a book hit the mark. Mr. Goldberg uses his extensive behind-the-scenes knowledge of Hollywood to make fun of movie stars, showbiz, Trekkies, Star Wars fan boys, and all the other movers and shakers. There are two relatively 'sane' people the story revolves around and, well, the rest are pretty much bat poop crazy! I hope you laugh, gasp, and chuckle as much as I did."
2,Great Food from a great book,"I love the recipes in this book so far I have tried at least twenty of them. The chicken valdostana is my favorite especially when you add a tablespoon of red vermouth to the sauce with the wine, it enhances the recipe. One of the best Italian cookbooks I have tried, simple, direct, and easy to follow just like watching Lidia."
2,Really nice romance,"I found THE MARRIAGE LIST to be an entertaining read as long as you are not too picky about historical details. This is a very good first novel and I can say that Dorothy McFalls definitely improved her accuracy in later books but she didn't need to improve her characters' personalities or the way that they interact with each other as that was already good. The dialogues were not necessarily authentic for the time period, but they came across as realistic conversations between the characters. To me, the most important point when I read a Regency romance is whether or not I enjoyed reading it, and I certainly did like this book. Therefore, I definitely recommend it."
2,Very Underrated!,"This Album is completely underrated, it may be a little commercial but the songs are tremendous. The cd seems to have energy and passion, it even sounds angry at times. Songs like Facing the animal, Another time, and End of my rope are awsome. The only negative thing i can say is that its not holding up as well as other malmsteen releases, thats probably because ive listened to it a couple thousand times.my ratings are,Braveheart-7/10Facing the animal-10/10Enemy-8/10Sacrifice-9/10Like an angel-7/10My Resurrection-10/10Another time-10/10Heathens from the north-7/10Alone in paradise-6/10End of my rope-10/10Only the strong-8/10Poison in your veins-6/10Air on a theme-7/10"
2,Blocks out most light,"This item blocks out most light. If you want 100 light blockage, you will need to buy a brand that fits a bit tighter or puts a small amount of pressure on your eyes."
2,Wonder Boys,"Grady Tripp is a professor/writer living in Pittsburgh who is struggling with writer's block. Whilst doing this, he also manages to get the chancellor pregnant. In the meantime, he and a college student, James Leer are trying to find a rare jacket once owned by Marilyn Monroe, and a college girl, Hannah Green boarding with Grady has a bit of a crush on him. `The Wonder Boys'. this character is not a stereotypical teacher but a fantastically original creation emphasized by Douglas winning performance. The acting is flawless, with at least two superb supporting roles. Robert Downey jr sparkles in his role, but it is Tobey Maguire who makes you feel he has always been that awkward, deadpan student that is James Leer. Fresh, funny and entertaining."
2,Rammstein- Mutter,Rammstein comes backs with yet another AMAZING CD for a follow up after their world hit Sehnsucht. I personally love the CD and look forward to seeing them Friday live in Hannover Germany :) If you're into hard-core/dark music you'll deffinetly want to pick this one up!
2,BUY THIS ALBUM!!!! NOW!!!,"Without a doubt, this is one of the most incredible and moving punk records ever released. Gameface's ""Three To Get Ready"" has more emotion and drive than any of the ""emo"" that's out there. Do you like JimmyEatWorld, Texas is the Reason, or any band like them? Where do you think they got their sound from? This album rocks from start to finish, with interesting music and thoughtful lyrics throughout. Certainly the best thing to come out of Orange County, and I guarantee it will stay in your CD player for weeks on end. Beautiful, powerful punk rock. BUY IT!"
2,Daughter loved it!,"We used this book to aid in learning about archaeology in 1st grade science. My daughter really loved this book, and even called it her favorite for awhile! It really sparked her interest in archaeology and made her decide that she wants to be an archaeologist (among several other things!) when she grows up."
2,Teriffic book!!!,"This book was sooo good! You can tell that friendship is really important in this book because if not Merill would always only think that Braq is the only horse suitable for her! But the Saddle Club and Phil and AJ helps Merill discover that she can jump on lots of other horses too! This is a great book and you can learn a new game too, if you don't know how to play Yakee Swap! It's a great game to play but I don't think Veronica thinks so! Want to know why? Just read this book!"
2,Carlotta looks for missing women,"Carlotta Carlyle can barely makes ends meet with her two jobs as a cab driver and a private investigator in Boston. She counts herself fortunate when she gets two cases at once, but she soon regrets her decision to take them both. Her first client is a young teenage boy who hires Carlotta to track down a 14-year-old girl who is missing. The second case involves Carlotta's longtime friend and ex-boss, Lieutenant Mooney, who asks her to track down a missing witness who can testify for him in a case against a man who accuses him of assault. As these two cases unfold, Carlotta has to deal with two irresponsible plumbers who threaten to turn her bathroom into a garish horror. Author Barnes artlessly weaves the criminal cases in with Carlotta's personal life which is often hilarious and never dull. This is a worthy follow-up to Trouble of Fools, the first book of this enjoyable series."
2,A great first novel,"I've heard a lot of good things about this books, so I throught I'd give it a chance. I was very pleased on how good this book was.In the mid 1860's a chruch was built for the Reverend Wendall McFall. His sermons were about God's other Son. He was going to undo all of the work that Jesus did. But for this to happen, a sacrifice was needed. A sacrifice had to be a child. When he did this, the towns people hanged him. They thought that it was going to be the end....it was just the beginning. Then in present day someone comes and claims that he's God's other son, then the murders start. Are they the work of this ""other son"" or are they the work of a creature that haunts the church. And who is this creature. Read the book and find the answersNicholas has a powerful style of writing. He has the abablity to keep the read glued to the page. The characters are life like, you help to want to get to know them.If you love horror, then you have to start this book. You won't be sorry."
2,Quick Delivery,Well satisfied. Product arrived way before expected and it came better than it was described. I would purchase from this seller again.
2,Noah Had It Easy!,"Reads a lot like ""Chicka Chicka Boom Boom"" by John Archambault. This rythmic, rhyming, counting book involves various jungle animals, and a small boy sitting down to eat. The animals pressure the boy into inviting them into his house, one-by-one.The text definitely does have a nice rythmic flow to it, which will keep children listening, and anticipating as the house gets more and more crowded with animals. A very, good counting book."
2,amazing versatility,"The Jody Grind were one of the most interesting roots-rock/country groups of the early '90's & a showcase andspringboard for a distinctive singer, Kelly Hogan. This album is an eclectic mix of country, blues, & ""classic pop""standards, dipped occasionally in Georgia Southern Gothic imagery and touches of various folk rhythms. Perhaps a bit too eclecticat times-- but it would have been interesting to see where the group might have gone. Essential though for any Hogan fan, and definitely of interest for anyone with a taste for alternative country, roots rock or country blues."
2,Mesmerizing---the ultimate sensory experience in cinema.,This movie explores our spiritual and material connection to the universe as individuals and communities. A silent film narrated by the stunning camera work and accompanying soundtrack. I felt hypnotized and found myself glued to a friend's couch after having announced that I needed to go as I have so much to do....I will watch this periodically to remind myself of the lesson contained within this mesmerizing film...
2,back in form,"I roundly condemned this groups's last recording, but in this one I find they've returned to the form that made me fall for them. I can honestly recommend this album even to neophyte listeners because I simply can't find fault with it."
2,It's a Mousepad,"Bought this for my new office job. It's a basic mouse-pad. I like that it is large. It's pretty nondescript, but the price was right and the shipping was faster than the other items I bought that day. Nothing fancy, but get's the job done and for a really cheap price."
2,Good Book,"My girlfriend and I are reading this book together. I like it! Great story and I love how the author takes you to places all over the globe. If your into zombies or ""The Walking Dead"" TV Show you will like this. Read it before the movie comes out this summer!The book itself came in good shape from Amazon and looked to be brand new."
2,I love these bars.,I love these bars....especially because they have no sugar (and no artificial sugar). All the nuts are stuck together with a sweet thick syrup. I wish I could get them by automatic shipment.
2,Throw away the inkjet,"The days of laserjets is gone. Every home should have a small laser printer like this for there text printing needs. It's cheaper to have this and a seperate inkjet for color than just an inkjet. Plus, the laser printer produces a better quality copy with less hassles.I've had this printer for about 5 years. It has served my wife and I well. We were both in graduate programs and we also run a home business, so we have relatively heavy demand for a printer. We probably average about 50 pages/week.Anyway, this was cheap to purchase and has never jammed, given us print quality issues, or otherwise caused us headaches. It has paid for itself in money saved over inkjets plus the product is more professional. We've replaced the toner cartridge four times with generic versions, and they've produced good copies.Highly recommended for value, print quality, and value of toner cartridges."
2,simply astonishing,"well i dont know what to say what hasnt already been said so i will just restate the fact that this game has beautiful graphics, great gameplay, wonderful environment interaction, and an even better storyline:)"
2,Safe flying!,Ordered these due to articles I had read about blood clots in your legs on long flights. I travel between the US and Australia frequently and these have made all the difference in the world on those long flights. I had no foot or ankle swelling after 37 hours of travel and my legs never felt fatigued. Excellent buy for the money!
2,I'm looking for Space Cowboy,I loved this song in the eighties and would love to get it on cd. Does anyone know if this song is on 'Down to Earth'?
2,AMAZING little voice,I LOVE this CD. Sara has an amazing ability to bring the soothing rock and uplifting rock together in a twist of talent. I would suggest this CD to anyone.
2,COOL PERFORMANCE,"FOR BLONDIE FANS, ASIDE FROM THE PLOT WICH IS COVERED BY OTHER REVIEWS, IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE SHE PERFORMS ONSTAGE WITH AN UNKNOWN BAND IN A SMOKEY DIVE IN GOTHAM CITY & HER VOICE'S GOLDEN ESSENCE IS STARTLINGLY CAPTURED. IF FOR NO OTHER REASON, THESE PERFORMANCES ARE WORTH THE PRICE OF ADMISSION, NOT ON ANY LP'S MIGHT I ADD!"
2,9 1/2 Weeks-a must see!!,"One of the classics. I purchased this movie, because, one I didn't have it and two one of my girlfriends, aged 50 have not ever seen it. It's the consumate erotic love story. I couldn't believe that she had not seen it. So it was for education purposes, that I purchased it. Just kidding, of course. It's shot well, the casting is fantastic, and the lighting is fabulous. Even the fashion of the day is represented and the movie is still timeless!! Kim Basinger at her sexy best, beautiful, vulnerable, and real. Mickey Rourke, very handsome, before he went under the surgeon's knife. A very good performance. It was kind of the ""50 Shades"" for the 80's."
2,Solid Release,"Very catchy emotional punk, on Asian Man Records? Huh, well any way, this album is worth a listen. I do think that some of the lyrics seemed out of place (Kiss your Clavical for example, just never thought someone would refer to a collar bone like that in a punk song). Anyway, it's short, sweet, and worth the price of admission."
2,A Pleasant Suprise!,"I was at my local book store, looking for any book I could find, when I came across The Truth About Forever. I decided to buy it and give it read. I wasn't expecting much out of it, but page after page, I just became more and more intrigued by all of the characters. The characters were relatable as well as the themes of loss, love, and living your life to the fullest. When I finished the book, I lent it to a few of my friends and they really enjoyed it as well. Its definitely one of those books you can read again and again without getting tired of it."
2,One of the Best Summer Scents Ever!!!,I LOVE Escada's Island Kiss. I was very disappointed that it was discontinued. It's very light and refreshing. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a light summer scent.
2,Wonderful!!,"This video is a big hit with my 18 month old son. He wants to watch this video more than any other he has. It really keeps his attention, which says alot. Great visuals, songs, and educational content. It's refreshing to find videos out there that really can help a young child learn."
2,Handle With Care,"Despite how these stack up against better European brands, I like the thicker rods of pigment, which allow a much wider range of effects like whittling them to a broad edge and using fewer strokes to cover the same area. If you take extra care when sharpening and drawing with them, it can reduce the tendency for the pigment to shatter."
2,The Clasic work on Model Aerodynamics,"This is the classic work on model aircraft aerodynamics. 4th edition condesses theory and offers broader applications. Power planes, sailplanes, even sections on helocopters. A great book."
2,gets hot adults,It billowed white smoke when I Turned it on had looked like it might catch on fire. I turned it of and on a few times and it stopped smoking. Maybe 5 min
2,Worth Sharing,"This book can change you if you are open to it. It made me rethink a few assumptions I had about myself. I think all of us know the dictionary definition of virtues such as generosity and wisdom, but Marshall shares stories and personal insights that teach how to weave those qualities into the fabric of your life. This book is warm-hearted and inspiring. Its organization is well suited for discussion groups. The Lakota Way should be the way of our leaders, neighbors, family members and our hearts."
2,Remember....,"OK. Raise your hand if you bought this on 8-track when it first came out. Remember how the music faded out near the beginning of ""It's Easy""..... (click,clunk) ....and then faded back in on channel two!I imagine everyone who's wincing from this brutal (and totally uncalled for) lurch back to August, 1978 already has this on CD.So for anyone who's wading into Boston for the first time, let me say: there are no bad songs on this album! It's short (a mere 33:42). It's famous for Tom Scholz declaring that he released it before he was finished (under pressure from Epic Records). But there's nothing lacking about the tunes, the playing or production. It's pure Boston and every bit as great as the first album!"
2,Undead unmatched,First off if your up in the air about buying this movie for your collection you will be very happy to own it!Dont listen to the bad review's because these people clearly were sleeping when trying to watch this masterpiece that should be in the best zombie top 10 list!I OWN JUST ABOUT EVERY ZOMBIE MOVIE EVER MADE TRUST ME THIS ONE IS FIRE!!!!!
2,See 1995 edition,"1995 EDITION: (In print) ALEF-Beit; Jewish Thought Revealed Through the Hebrew Letters Yitzchak Ginsburgh / Paperback / PublishedEach letter of the alphabet (aleph bet) has meaning. Ginsburgh provides a dissertation on each of the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet, discussing even the sub-parts which make up the letters and meaning they contribute."
2,Durable and efficient,"I was here looking for a new vacuum, as my Sanyo vac is now nearly 15 years old, and I've worn out the dust brush and lost the crevice tool.Other than that, it still works amazingly well, and in my house really gets a HUGE workout with mostly hardwood floors, a husband, a 17 y/o boy, a golden retriever, and 3 cats.After reading the reviews, I think I'll try and find a new dust brush and a crevice tool, as I don't think I'll find anything better for less than $500. Although considering I paid about $50 for mine lo those many years ago, it doesn't owe me a dime!"
2,Works for me,I bought a few of these to mount my (Haier HLT71 7-Inch Handheld LCD TV) to my camcorders. They work great and allows me to rotate and angle the monitors in every direction without issue.
2,One of the greatest Book to TV adaptions ever made.,HBO takes sames changes to the Clash of Kings but does an overwhelmingly good job with the charactersThe productions values alone are worth the watchThis series is like no other. Love or hate them each character is real person and not a cliche villain or hero
2,Read the series,I am working my way through all of Griffin's novels and love the Corps series which I have now finished. Easy to find the next novel in the series from Amazon. Book was in good condition - only one page was a problem because it has something spilled on it.
2,What a great book !,"This is the second review of this book I have written for Amazon. This time around, I would rate it 10 if I could. This is the finest research I have ever come across about a most fascinating time and man. It is a must read for anyone interested in history, maritime affairs and the war of 1812. I just wish I could have been the author. Bravo."
2,"""This is a knife (set)!""",I thought I had used knoves before - they were toys. These are the real thing. Period. Buy them. You won't be sorry.
2,Good reading,I found that this book held my attention and left you wanting more and not able to put it down for long periods. A good author for those who are not true book worms like myself.
2,"Outstanding Dance Single, His ALBUM is MAGNIFICENT","Mabel is an Italian performer. His music is done in EIFFEL 65 style. BUM BUM is an EXTREMELY CATCHY EUROPOP and EURODANCE song. I can not believe that AMAZON does not carry his full length album, called DESTINATION. It is filled with MARVELOUS and FUN DANCE HITS, with some GREAT TECHNO and TRANCE as well. If you like catchy dance music with great melodies and hooks then check out this single, or better of check out Mabel's full-length album called DESTINATION. It will make you DANCE DAYS and NIGHTS AWAY. It is a solid dance, techno, and pop production. I really hope that this album will someday be released in U.S. Enjoy!!!!"
2,Other Options,"Although I have never ordered the candies from a website, I have heard from other reviews that the shipping is outrageous. I find that very disapointing since the chocolates themselves are so outstanding. However, these are available at other locations like airports around the country. That is, now a days you need to actually be flying in order to enter the shopping area, but that are often there if you do!"
2,Aenima is work of art!,"This the best cd I ever bought .Tool is the most unique band I ever listend too. It seems like most metal bands these days are going with the flow. They find a certain sound that they like and stay with, usually soundinng almost like others bands of there genere. But tool is different. Changing there sound from each cd trying to become better and better. Aenima is one of the best alblums ever. it has all original riffs and bass lines.(would you wear a bra on stage)"
2,Great Story!!,I loved this book it has action and adventure around every corner. This book is a little dark and is not for people looking to read just to be doing something because this story drags you in and it seems like you are with the characters and want to interact with them. Some parts are gutwrenching but i like that in a book. this is a good book for someone who dislikes reading. IT WILL GET YOU HOOKED!!!
2,Very Very good. Excellent Masculine smell!!,This is my THE favorite. I have a large collection of colognes and have tried a lot of them and keep on coming back to this one. A must have if you like wearing colognes. I am not sure if I can do justice in trying to describe how it smells but I can definitely say that people will ask you what are you wearing and you will get plenty of compliments on how you smell. I would recommend trying a little on your skin first and wait for some time and then smell it again. It smells too strong right after the application but gets to a more smooth smell after a little bit and then remains that way. Give it a try and you will not be disappointed.
2,Miniature Horses Veterinary Guide for Owners & Breeders,This is a very good book to have on your shelf. Especially for the novice or beginner.
2,Excellent Movie - Worthy of Your Viewing Time,"This movie was fantasic. I watched it as a teen on TV and just remember being blown away by it. I only wish Celeste Holm had a bigger role, but the brief appearance she makes is terrific none-the-less (I thought I had read somewhere that after Ms. Holm made this movie she moved on to helping folks in similar situations - not sure if that is accurate, but interesting if true). Check this one out. Definately worthy of your time."
2,Works Exactly As It Should,"This is the perfect coffee maker for the single person/coffee drinker. It works exactly as it should, with none of the complicated nonsense. I also urge everyone to completely disregard any negative reviews about ""leaking"". The pot does not leak. If you pour very quickly and at an extreme angle (easy to do with such a small pot), a few drops can come out of the receptacle in the center of the lid. It should be an embarrassment that so many people have failed to grasp the concept after more than 1 or 2 occurrences. The coffee maker works great."
2,It's Clutch...what more do you need?,"This is Clutch's most experimental record top date, and it truly is awesome. It may not be a ""refined"" as their other releases, but it has a unique feel that the others definitely do not have. In my opinion, though, Clutch is one of the few bands where each release is significantly different from the ones before. It is a short CD at c. 35 minutes, but still worth it by far."
2,never recived,"the soap is great but, i never recived the product the first send second time it was busted you need to find a better way to ship before i buy anything else"
2,Railroad folk music,This is a fun to listen to CD of folk songs about railroading. The recording was very good and well worth the money.
2,"Gritty, Texas flavor and another winner from JLB!","Like an actor, type-cast and losing steam, Dave Robicheaux's (briefly) on vacation, until the muse is rekindled. Instead we have Billy Bob, a ragged around the edges guy, whose nightmares, are thankfully fewer than our Crescent City pals.Like many, I've read all JLB, in chronological order, and like many, I've rushed sleeplessly through a story, then more leisurely re-read each to savor the fine writing and local flavor.I could eat chicken-fried steak or nopalitas with Billy Bob as well as piping hot beignets and po' boys with Dave. The tarnished hero, tilting at personal windmills is the common thread, here. The story is engrossing and tightly plotted. Here here, James Lee for trying something new. I enjoy Dave Robicheaux but I am willing to try something else-reaching a little outside a tried and true series to devour a new treat. Excellent read and ultimately rewarding on many levels."
2,The Five Dysfunctions of a Team,This book was an increadibly quick read (1 day)! Anyone in a managerial position can relate to the problems that Kathryn experienced in assuming her role as an incoming CEO. Highly recommended.
2,best rocker from the 70's,"Bob's the best rocker to come out of the 70's. The dude wrote most of the greatest songs at the time. I've been a fan for almost 40 years. still the same one of the best tunes to ever been written.One of the few who could sing, write, play great guitar{get out of denver}just do it all."
2,A real experience,I heard the album on the radio and immediately bought it. What a fine listening experience; truly requires active listening.
2,works great!,"I got these for Christmas presents, but I've used them to make sure they work well, and I love them. I always have a hard time with the touch pad on laptops and this makes using the laptop so much easier. I love that it is small and compact."
2,can't wait till the full length,"this album is too good. if the single is this terrific, the the full length will be absolutely amazing."
2,I have Scleraderma,"Being diagnosed with this disease was overwhelming for myself and my family. There were so many questions. Where were the answers? I was being treated by a doctor specializing in rheumatoid arthritis. I hit the internet and found a ""specialist"" in my metro. area. I am now under the care of Dr. Maureen Mayes. At this time her book had not yet been released. I feel lucky that I have her knowledge in treating scleraderma and in her book she can share that expertise with others. The book has been extemely helpful in explaining to family and friends what scleraderma is and how it can be treated."
2,The Hunter - One of the best book on the year,"Gennita Low is definitely on my must buy list. This is her 4th book. Each and everyone of them is a keeper. I have already pre-order her next book ""Sleeping with the Agent"". She managed to write a romantic suspense novel with both male (mostly male) and female point of view, packed with action and adventure without cheating the romance readers."
2,NICE SOUNDING BOOMBOX AND DEFINITELY SHOWS PANASONIC QUALITY! WHY THEY DISCONTINUED THIS MODEL IS FAR BEYOND BELIEF!,This has got to be one of the best cd boomboxes that I have ever had the pleasure own or hear. It is quality all the way. Panasonic really out did themselves on this one! I can't understand why they discontinued this model as it was a very well rated and received boombox. I love the design and especially the sound. It is not over bassy and yet it packs a punch! I have had a newer Sony model and took it back to the store because the bass sounded artificial and vibrated and made a tinny sound which was absolutely horrible. Panasonic is definitely better quality than Sony has been lately. Buy this one and you won't be dissappointed. I bought mine used off eBay and it was worth every penny.
2,Required reading,"This book will open your eyes. If you haven't read it yet, do so now. The man is a genius and would have been President had the liberal biased media not gone after him with their lies. It should be required reading in high schools."
2,Very good for what it is,"We've been ""product testing"" a variety of green teas in our office. So far the Stash green has been the most favorably received, just ahead of the Yamamoto-yama ""Sushi Bar"" tea. Stash won out due to the fact that it's got a distinctive green tea ""taste"" and seems resistant to bitterness from oversteeping. ""Sushi Bar""-like some others-tended to be a little weak. Other rejected greens veered to the other end of the spectrum were overly bitter if you so much as looked at them wrong.As described, it is slightly sweet and nutty. The description also states that this green tea is imported from Brazil. That might be a bit off-putting at first. However, it's idiot-proof and, like the title alludes to, this is teabag tea and for that, the Stash is very good stuff."
2,Fantastic,This book has so many wonderful ideas and great patterns/explanations. I can't wait to get started!
2,Amazing Product !,"Why anyone would find something to complain about with this product is beyond me. This phone is outstanding.As with most products, read the manual. Learn how to use and enjoy this product. This phone is packed with features and even the basic ones are terrific. It even looks cool."
2,An excellent book but A bit over priced,"This is an excellent book, and one of the most comprehensive on the market. With that said, Dadant has it for 36 dollars. So although I have this book, which is the best bee book on the market, I didn't pay as much as it is listed here for."
2,"Great film, but...","I was extremely pleased with this treatment of the classic text. However, if you're enough of a fan of the film to go out and buy it, why not wait until November to get the special release with 30 extra minutes?"
2,Absolultely powerful and mindblowing!!!,"Woohoo! I just got Clay's cd today and I have to say, the songs are so WONDERFUL! My favorite is ""This is the Night"". Clay's voice is just so powerful, moving, dramatic and sweet! You'll just be caught in Clay's powerful spell! Bridge Over Troubled Water is cool too! I have to say, that I cannot wait for his debut album. I am DEFINITELY buying it when it comes out this summer! I don't think I'll ever be bored of Clay's voice ~_~ Clay is my number 1 idol, forever!"
2,Enjoyable,"I do not have a fireplace and this idea came up. This fireplace video does almost everything that a real one does right down to the sound, which is very pleasing.It is nice to sit back a read your favorite book, or have a conversation with your wife or freinds over a favorite beverage.Very satisfied"
2,Captivating Voice,"I have Diane's two newest CD's and enjoy them both, but I just heard this CD, and I like these songs even better."
2,"Covers All Of McCartney's Music, Charities And Everything Paul","Bill Harry thoroughly details all of McCartney's songs, records, tours, friends, pets, studios, producers and charities. It includes wonderful biographies of Linda and Heather Mills McCartney. You can learn about his many animal rights endeavors, his vegetarianism and numerous other charitable causes that he promotes. Every other Paul McCartney book is utterly incomplete. Bill Harry's comprehensive research is laudable, commendable and a must buy for any Paul McCartney fan."
2,Great!!,"Very entertaining movie. My daughter recommended it, glad she did!! Funny, witty and a great love story too! Would watch it again!!"
2,A must read,If you are on a anethesia rotation this is a must have. Easy to read and helps you with all aspects of your rotation.
2,Best knife sharpener for the price!,"I have always had one of these handy gadgets. I recently moved and had to leave my other one behind, so I bought a new one. I now also own a very expensive knife set (for once in my life), and after doing all the research, this is still the best choice for your knives. Don't be fooled by how inexpensive it is...it really works, and it is a quality product."
2,Motivated for life,"I'm 57 years old. I ran Cross Country for Joe Newton in 1963.He STILL motivates me. Every time that I feel like quitting, Ithink of Joe Newton, and it gets me going again. How's that for motivation?"
2,GREAT PRODUCT,"I just received this cable and I am very pleased with it so far. It arrived ahead of the scheduled delivery time which makes me very happy. It performs as advertised, hey, it's just a cable. NOTE - If you are going to use HDMI cables on any project, just keep in mind that the cable doesn't support audio, which I just found out."
2,Not an Evangelical? This book may be for you anyway....,"I was drawn to order this book when I heard Campolo interviewed on NPR.My own beliefs tend heavily toward the liberal side of the scale so I surprised how interested I was in what Campolo had to say during the interview. Clearly, what he was saying often was not what I expected to hear from an Evangelical. So I purchased the book to learn more about him and I recommend the book for others, like me, who aren't satisfied to just sit with their assumptions and are open to learning about the common ground we can share with folks whose beliefs we may not understand as well as we thought we did."
2,Flawless product,I have used the product for about 1 month now and I am extremely satisfied with this product. I am using the included USB cable and cradle to keep the wireless adapter on top of my desk where I get much better signal. I get 54Mbps signal all the time and no disconnections.
2,The 21st Century's Most Heretical Literary Work,"Salacious, explicit, controversial and saucy. This book's gonna rock."
2,Wonderful older novel-new to me,"The description drew me right into purchasing this book. Though I'd never read any Campbell, I will now as I get a chance. A well-planned and tightly woven tale of intrigue, murder and pagan beliefs still held secretly in a corner of England is coupled with a young woman and her friend searching for a copy of a movie made several decades before by Karloff and Lugosi, but which never made a screening and had seemingly vanished, so no copies were available. Side plots include the wandering ""Enoch's Army,"" a group of people who believe everything is pretty much going to hell in a handbasket and they want to settle on land by themselves and away from everything in the outside world. Secretive villagers, a smug and rude lord of a manor, and research into the world of old movies blends seamlessly into a tale that is difficult to put down. The first chapter sets up an image that the reader slowly comes to understand as pages flip by. A very enjoyable read."
2,A visual mardi gras!,"Lynne managed to do it again...with her dazzling second book she inspired me to pick up my art materials and get to work! The book is beautiful, and there are some new ideas to get your creative juices flowing. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the book was just a tad repetitive of the first one (a lot of the same artists using the same techniques giving the book the same general feel)."
2,A Fascinating Read,"Puritan religious disputes can sound arcane to modern ears, but Eve LaPlante explains those quarrels in clear and meaningful terms, bringing out the intense drama of Anne Hutchinson's trial and its aftermath. I also appreciated learning more about Hutchinson's background in England, and about her father's own career in dissent. This research, along with the fluid writing, really made Anne Hutchinson come alive for me, in a way she just hadn't before."
2,Love these girls,"I love these girls. I used to listen to my Mom's copy of this when I was a kid and I'm glad to have my own now. Great EP. ""Runaway Love"" was a definite smash. I wish these girls would get back together and make some more records."
2,Seedling Heat Mat helped improve germination,"Obtained much better germination rates with the mat, but some slight uneveness in the heat distributed across the surface area"
2,Songs in A Minor -- A 'soul'searching delight,"This woman can sing, and she can also play. She has a sultry seducting voice that just intices you to listen more, and more and more. She has complete talent 100%. Being a singer myself I find it hard to find a singer I can enjoy without the media corrupting him/her turning them into a sex symbol or however. But Alicia is the complete package. She knows how to sing using her soul, and her gut instinct, and it definetly is proven with her all of her songs. ""Fallin"", ""Caged Bird"" etc. They are all great. For anyone leaning towards buying this album. Please do because you won't be disappointed and the feeling you get from listening to the lyrics will last for a lifetime. Well done Alicia Keys."
2,The master at work!,"Hitchcock's classic is exactly that for good reason. Everytime I see this movie I am again grabbed by its incredible ability to shock, terrify, and intrigue me. The extra material on this DVD provides great insight into the direction and writing of a movie everyone must own."
2,Great coffeemaker but...,"I really enjoy the coffeemaker. It makes a great cup of coffee. My only reservation is the finish. The paint began crazing after a couple of uses. I am lucky that it tucks in under my cabinets as it is unattractive. If you are looking for a showpiece on your counter, unless they have changed their paint quality, this is not the piece for you."
2,5 stars aren't enough!,"This is THE best CD I have purchased in quite some time. There is not a bad song on it. ""The Reason"" resonates with feeling and depth that are rarely heard in so many of today's songs. ""It Could Have Been Anyone"" makes you want to cry with happiness even if your special someone is only in your dreams.Carole King's piano soothes one's soul in these troubled times, and her voice has only gotten better through the years. I have played this CD over and over since it arrived and am still not tired of it. It is truly a beautiful piece of work!!!!"
2,"Annoying to Parents, Fun to Kids","Although my brother and his wife didn't like the gift too much, haha. Two kids using it A LOT can be annoying, but fun for them at least. Arrived promptly and was packaged well. The only thing I didn't like is that all the voices somewhat sounded alike so the three settings didn't really serve their full function. Overall I would recommend this."
2,Frasier Seasons,'Frasier' is one of my absolute favorite series. I will eventually own all seasons! Its comedy is timeless!
2,Worth the research,This was an excellent buy. The cover was cracked but I put it in a new cover and it was like new.
2,Works Great,I'm so glad I bought this lightweight vacum. It's perfect for cleaning up those little messes in between regular vacuming instead of dragging out the big vacum. I love it!!
2,Better Than Morse,"I enjoyed Morse when it was originally broadcast but found him a depressing character on rewatching. Lewis is a better man -- perhaps not as intellectual, but as good a detective and someone you'd enjoy meeting for a pint. His sidekick is an excellent foil for him -- an intellectual rocker. The plotting is excellent and the production values what you'd expect. I've enjoyed the Foyle's War series the most, but Lewis is a close second. If you're a fan of the British detective genre you'll absolutely love Lewis."
2,Good book,"I must admit that I'm late in submitting this review (since I read the book about 2-3 years ago), but I have to say that this book is excellent for beginners (as books usually are when Andre' writes them). Although I did not experience any problems with the examples, I have to agree that if you call yourself a programmer you should be able to fix glitches in the source code and continue forward (the world is a far cry from being a perfect place). Anyway, Andre', again, demonstrates his unique ability to show how to do game development at a level that everyone can understand. Sure this book is for the days of DOS, but the techniques can be used for today's Windows games. I'm looking forward to adding Andre's new Guru book to my collection. As always, keep up the excellent work Andre'."
2,unique and clear,"This is the only good vegetarian Japanese cookbook I have found. The author is a British woman who lived and worked in Japan for several years, and developed vegetarian recipes with the Japanese women she lived with. She is creative and successful in the way she modifies traditional Japanese recipes to fit into a vegetarian lifestyle. She incorporates personal stories and Japanese history into her recipes, making this book fascinating as well as useful!"
2,love it,"i love this diaper bag, not only was it something that i can actually get my husband to carry around when he has the little ones but it is soooo durable. I have spent alot of money on various diaper bags and a majority of them end up wearing out and the zippers break or the material gets holes in it. I have had this one for a yea now and it looks like it is still brand new, definately a cost worthy product"
2,Fantastic! Also check out Steven Delopoulos too!,"'Simple Things' is an excellent, well thought out release! Amy continues to please with passionate, heartfelt songwriting that touches many fans. Myself included. Speaking of beautiful, well-crafted singing/songwriting, you've got to check out 'Me Died Blue', the masterful, gorgeous release by New Jersey inspirational singer/songwriter extraordinaire, Steven Delopoulos. Steven has gone solo, and used to be with 'Burlap To Cashmere'. He has gotten so much better with his latest release, and his latest is a STUNNER! Can't stop playing both these CD's lately!!!"
2,ROTFL!,"Rolling on the floor laughing out loud! If you haven't experienced this common netiscism yet, you will while listening to this album. Especially hilarious are Russell's takes on writing your own Gilbert & Sullivan operetta and Wagner's Ring Cycle. This CD is a must for every classical music lover with a sense of humor. You won't be disappointed!"
2,Magical movie,"Prancer is magical. The little girl who plays Jessica is a fabulous little actor. She's real; not precocious and obnoxious like so many children's roles today (the film is from 1989). You feel her angst as she tries to get the various townspeople to believe that she has found Santa's reindeer. The scenery of the film is beautiful. The film's music score is pathetic. Overall, definitely a four out of five stars."
2,great for price,"I cannot stand the fluff of a regular pillow so I decided to purchase the feather/down pillow... I love sleeping with this pillow!! I had to get another sheet set that had King sized pillow cases. I also wish there were slightly more Down for a softer feel, but I think with time, the slightly harder feel will not even be noticed with wear."
2,"Stuart Hart, ""Inner Voice""","I have quite a large collection of jazz recordings, from the early greats to the edge-breakers of todays jazz innovators. Stuart Hart and his fine collection of musicians, including, Dennis Chambers, Matthew Garrison, Jr., Gary Grainger and Gary Thomas, play like with a desire and energy that one seldom hears on any album. I have also been privileged to hear Hart's band play live and it is truly a remarkable show. Stuart Hart is an amazing guitar player that seems to have an incredible command of old and new jazz components. He writes his own songs and communicates his feelings and desires through his guitar. Truly worth a listen; you won't be disappointed."
2,Very good DVD,"I have always loved Irish dancing (...everything Irish actually...) and after seeing Riverdance I knew LOTD would be great. It was...and this DVD captures all of it. The music is great. And, of course, Flatley and his dance troupe do a WONDERFUL job.The reason I give this four stars is because I found the camera work somewhat annoying on the DVD. As other reviewers have noted, the camera angle changes quite often and there are several slow motion effects that I would prefer not be in there. However, I have read many complaints about the sound quality of this DVD. I found it to be rather good. I don't have one of these super nice surround-sound systems (as I suspect most people don't...) so I can't comment on the quality of my 30th channel ;). I also don't see anything wrong with the lighting. I've watched the dvd no less than 100 times and the lighting quality looks great to me."
2,one of my favorite movies ever made,"Brandon Lee was great in this movie much like he was in every thing else he did this movie just show's how big of a genus this guy was i loved every scene, this is one of those type's of movies you just don't watch once but you want to watch over and over again geat story about love and Revenge"
2,Family Game Night,"I purchased this game to add to our family game closet. We love trivia games. This game adds a twist with the riddle questions. I found it to be not as challenging as Trivial Pursuit, but as enjoyable."
2,Heavenly Truffles,Devinely Heaven is the only way to describe these Truffles. If youv'e never had them your in for a special treat. I will be purchasing them again for special occassions!
2,Highly recommended.,"If you are looking for a bike seat that will be as comfortable as your couch, this saddle is not for you simply because such product doesn't exist. However if you want upgrade a comfort level from generic saddle, and sit on a gelly / high density foam you won't be disappointed. I've been using it for over a year, and can say that despite its low price it is a quality product. My commute is 16miles/day and I never feel any pain related to the saddle. Just remember that if you are not used to riding a bike on regular basis your bum will hurt for a short time no matter what saddle you have. Highly recommended."
2,"Trolls Stink, But They Also RULE!!!!","The Armored Troll figure is so far one of the biggest Lord of the Rings figures available. I just picked this huge ""hulking"" sucker up and I must tell you it's awesome. If only the same guys at ToyBiz went the route of the LOTR figures and made a HULK figure with the detail and size that the Troll has, it would have been one of the best Marvel figures ever made. This figure is just awesome, the box is great. It's display is perfect for any collector, for the kid in all of us this is one durable toy and so very fun to play with. I'm planning on buying 2 more to open so I can re-create the scene from the Two Towers at the black gates of Mordor, when the 2 Trolls were being forced to open the gate doors for the Easterling army.Get this figure, get 2 or 3... You won't be disapointed. It's so awesome seeing this huge figure overshadowing the smaller 6"" figures from the same line. Just AWESOME!"
2,He's at it again...............,Ray Davies just keeps making quality music and the liner notes were enjoyable to read. Its a shame that the media just doesn't appreciate Ray Davies and the Kinks like they do Mic and the Stones.Other People's Lives
2,Great book for those going deeper in intercession.,"Cindy's book is a wealth of information on prayer and intercession. It covers everything from the call to intercede to conducting ""spiritual mapping"" and praying to break strongholds over your city. This book is a definite for intercessors, as well for pastors and other spiritual leaders to understand the depth involved in spiritual warfare."
2,Perfect,I have been in love with this movie since I was 10 and now at 23 the music is still such a touch of beauty to the art and amazment of this movie
2,Love story for real people (esp. flakes?),"I enjoy Ricky G and many characters in this film were enjoyable. The story is fine. I love the short sequence of NYC towards the end. Beautiful! I didn't ""love"" this film because that rating is for movies that deserve it, and this film is entertaining but not great or ""outstanding"". It is probably okay for family viewing, w/o the offensive raw sex and profanity that so many films are ruined by. No violence to worry about either, and it is not political."
2,"Wall-E great movie, Bluray meh","This is a great movie, cheesy but beautiful, and my son watches it over and over. But why did we buy the bluray version? It's agonizingly slow to load and we haven't been interested in any of the features."
2,love it,There was NOT one thing I didn't LOVE about this item! It was everything it said it was. The delivery was in 2 days (to my surprise and delight) was very easy to set up and my Doberman loves it!
2,A powerful virtuoso performance by all,"The folks at CBS Records who release the various Masterworks audio disks are to be commended. The performance on this recording is stunning, both the violinist and the orchestra. Add it to your collection no matter what."
2,Time & $$ well spent!!,"I have been reading most of the Young Jedi books - but this one is the best yet. I especially like that Anderson & Moesta don't take ""Young Adult"" to mean ""No romance or suspense"". I'm 25, and I find the Young Jedi books to be just as entertaining as the Zahn & co. ""Adult"" books. I hope they bring out more books after the movies! Especially since it doesn't look like George Lucas will ever get to the ""sequel"" chapters. More Lusa, please!"
2,A little bit... creepy. But good.,"This is described as ""sweet"" and ""lovely"" by other reviewers. I'm probably just a bad person or something, but initially I just get a sort of creepy feeling from it. Maybe you have to read the whole series to get it. Right now it's just disturbing me. I'm not saying it's not good; it's terrifically well written and drawn and told. I think part of the reason it's giving me the crawlies is *because* it's so well done. If it were silly, or dumb, it wouldn't be nearly so affecting. But Clamp - the quartet of women who write it - take their craft seriously, and it shows.Initially it's about a very, very innocent girl who lives alone. A man moves in next door. She likes him...The emptyness of the rooms, the teddy bears sitting on the floor to see her off and greet her; you can almost hear the silence of the house. That's what's giving me the shivers. Ignorance is not bliss. I'll probably have to read the rest of them or it's going to bug me forever."
2,One of my favorite bars,"Their banana bread bar is definitely one of the tastier bars in the market for those who like the taste of bananas... The texture is perfect for a soft juicy biteAs for the nutrition, the ingredients used are wholesome and even the fat content comes from almonds & fruit..This has become my staple breakfast for most work days"
2,OUTSTANDING...,"I own dozens of cookbooks but this is one I use consistently. In fact, I have two of them (from a time when we had a weekend house). I've made dozens of the recipes and have been pleased every single time. If you are looking for healthy, delicious meals that will gain you kudos from family and guests alike, this cookbook is for you."
2,Harrison Ford Fan,"Being a big fan of Harrison Ford, I got to the point with my old VHS movies that I just had to have the DVD versions. I have not been disappointed. The image and sound qualities are excellent and I appreciate the slim DVD cases since we have a storage issue."
2,wow,I really enjoyed the cowboy bebop remix collection- it was entertaining and the product got to me on time and in very good order
2,Highly Satisfied (as always),"As with all Inside Out books from Microsoft Press, Excel 2003 was fantastic. The thing I love most about these books is (1) the comprehensiveness of the book while (2) not forgetting to cover the fundamentals of the product. Thus, anything you want to do with Excel is covered, from simple formatting to working with external data all the way up to creating highly complex spreadsheets with macros and programming. This book is perfect for all Excel (or spreadsheet) creators."
2,Better than their debut...,"This album had to grow on me A LOT. I think it's better than their debut, but it still isn't up to par to Home Grown or Kemuri, in my opinion. A nice combination of Punk and Ska, especially in ""Superman."""
2,SCREAM RULES!,SCREAM IS THE GREATEST MOVIE AND SCREAM 2 ALSO KICKS. THEY ARE MY 2 FAVORITE MOVIES EVER.I COMPLETELY RECOMMEND THEM TO EVERYONE.IF YOU GET THESE MOVIES YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED TRUST ME:)
2,A Real Page Turner! Gripping!,"Monette Bebow-Reinhard has faithfully recreated all of the characters of the Cartwright family from the Bonanza television series as the vast majority of the legions of fans of this now 50-year old program know and love them.Many Bonanza novels have been written and published in the past and there are thousands of self-published Fan Fiction efforts readily available to those who seek it but Monette Bebow-Reinhard is the ONLY ""Bonanza"" novelist in the entire world to have been authorized by David Dotort, the creator of the original television program - and that says it all.Felling of the Sons is a gripping read from the first page to the last. Adam, Hoss, Little Joe, Ben and Hop Sing are all absolutely true to the original characters and are lovingly painted by an author who really knows her stuff!If you love Bonanza, BUY THIS BOOK - You will not regret it."
2,Good product!,"This product is great, it takes very little so the bottle will last a long time. Great value for great product!"
2,an amazing mp3 player,"The philips gogear is sleek, reliable, and just plain awesome! It holds 3 times more than the 2 GB ipod nano, has fm radio, radio and voice recording, and better sound quality for the same price. occasionally the screen freezes, but simply restart it and it works fine after that. I like how the buttons light up when you touch them.Overall,this is a great kid/teenager mp3 player, that holds over 700 songs if you have it on the highest sound quality. I'm 14, and I think its great."
2,Czech history in U.S.,"I've skimmed some of the pages (due to lack of time) & several paragraphs make me believe this is a very useful, informative book."
2,"Thong, Puhh-lezzz!","I'm sorry but I have four of these dolls given to me by my grand parents and they did not think that the clothing that the doll was wearing was inappropriate, they found them adorable. A thong does not cover all of the behind but, these baby's behinds are completley covered!! So parents, stop over reacting and give your kids what they want!"
2,Great Book,"This is a wonderful book for a Christian school to use around Christmas time. It tells about Jesus' birth, death, and love by using the familiar candy cane. Big pages, interesting story, and great pictures."
2,It worked for me and my baby,"I wanted to share my experience with this positioner because I kept debating if I should purchase it or not and there were not many reviews on it, so it made me wonder how useful it really could be. I had registered for it and finally got it as a baby shower gift. I am glad I did. My son was a C-section baby and he has reflux and he seems to snore when he sleeps. This item is essential for babies who have reflux since it keeps their head elevated to help them sleep better through the night. I gave it 4 stars because like the other mom shared, my baby does slide down but I have never found him face down or in a position that he might suffocate. He has been sleeping on the positioner since birth and he is now 6 weeks old. The solution I found to help with the sliding is placing a towel (making a U shape) that is sturdy enough to prevent him from sliding and it works."
2,Best lens cleaning device,The pen works perfectly! Excellent construction and price. It leaves the lenses super clean. I recommend it 100%. Cleaning brush and the lens cleaning excellent size to do the job.
2,Practical Research Planning review,The book was very informative and provided the level of information I needed for my research. There was a very simple explanation describing quantitative research that anyone could understand.
2,Great Deal/Wonderful product,"This solved a major need I had for an easy xfer mechanism between some of my peers at work. Works well, as advertised, and the capless design is wonderful.Heartily recommended."
2,Hanna whitall Smith by Henry. M.,"""Hanna whitall Smith by Henry. M.This biography gave me extra insite to the life and work of this extrememly importatn Chritian author. It was focussed primamrily around her family life more than her public life.I will have to look elswhee for the latter."
2,Birth of Flight:History of Civil Aviation,This DVD was purchased as a Christmas gift for my husband who has been an avid pilot since he was 16 years of age. He did not know this was availble and was thrilled to receive it. I highly recommend it to anyone who has an interest in aviation.
2,I've tried them all and this is best,"Yes it's a bit more expensive than the Axe and other hair products but there's a good reason... This stuff is better. It cost me $12 from Pro Concepts through Amazon. Product was supposed to arrive on Jan 9 but I didn't get it until Jan 22. Apparently they forgot to ship it up Pro Concepts immediately responded to me through email and shipped it out on the 18th.Great for guys, not shiny, not too stiff. Looks like normal dry hair after you style it"
2,CAPTIVATING STORIES,"I've found a hero--Socrates! The stories are lessons in love, friendship, community, integrity, redemption, and just plain ole survival. They will make you laugh one minute and cry the next. This book is one enjoyabe read. I highly recommend it."
2,Unusual book by an interesting teacher,"Erich, if you have ever experienced his teaching in person, is an interesting teacher. He has a very exploratory nature when it comes to yoga and frequently practices at home and makes up new postures as he goes. He has a pretty lengthy book here that has a lot to offer that you may not have seen quite that way before. If you are interested in a fresh new look at yoga, this book could be for you!"
2,concise resource,"When you're ten years out of school, and you still reach for a book you used in college, you know its valuable. I reach for Bube as a refresher very frequently. Its not flowery, but it has just enough figures and just enough math and explanation to cover most electronic phenomena. Photoemission, field emission, photoelectric effects, schottky barriers, etc. are covered well enough so that you can tackle a calculation of a particular phenomenon when necessary."
2,Glad I bought it,"I like every CD of this set. The music was good, nice arrangements and good musicians, plus Vince Gill's good guitar playing and singing. Very versatile musician this man is."
2,The best Sci-fic movie I've ever seen!,"Most viewers said this film was bad, but to me it was pretty good. I don't usually get sci-fic movies but I actually get this one. If you like horror, love, and space movies check this movie out. This movie is about a perfect all-American couple. Spencer Armocost (Depp)has died in space, then a life force take his body and his memory. NASA lost contact for two minutes and in space with the another astronaut contact them back. His goal to make his wife(Theron) pregant and he need his own kind to make a space ship from their design. ~~~~~I ACTUALLY GIVE IT 4.5 STAR!~~~~~"
2,A message for this fatherless generation,"This book is a message that all the fathers, wifes, sons & daughters need to hear. I am a clinical psychiatrist, I really get a lot of help from this book."
2,Versatile yet diminutive light,My first impression upon opening the box was that this light is quite small. I purchased it for use in wedding videography. It works well for short range (10-15') such as interviewing party guests. It's not intended to cover a long distance. The IR feature is a great extra. I also like the fact that it draws its power from the camcorder battery. Fewer batteries to charge and track simplifies my job.
2,They're awesome!,"I think Stretch Princess is an awesome band, which their CD proves! It wouldn't have been if I hadn't really like the song ""Sugar"" which I heard in the movie Passport to Paris[lol itz a good movie!] the band is awesome and should be a lot more popular I'll try my best to spread the word!"
2,Harlem on the rise and you don't really want no problems with these guys!,"Mase is one of my favourite rappers of all time. I was happy that he was attempting a comeback a few years ago, too bad it didn't work out. That means I have to settle for old material but that's ok, cause Harlem World is a classic in my opinion. After more than a decade after it's release I'm still listening to Mr. Betha."
2,Best item for the Best price,I bought this binocular to my cousin. I found this after going through many online shopping sites and reading the review of binoculars online. This Binocular is very stable and the best part is the lens cap and the binocular case which came along with this.The only thing with which i was disappointed is user manual which is not clear for the first time user.Overall I am satisfied by the item and its shipping.
2,GREAT BRAILLE PLAYING CARDS and EASY TO READ,My brother says these are great. The braille is clear and easy to read and the cards are not stiff. I like it because anyone with low sight can also read the cards. Thanks for making a good product. These will be great fun to use.
2,not to worry,I too was upset till I came across Return of the Pink Panther in the 5.99 bin at Walmart. now im happy
2,Awesome bundt pan!!,"This pan made my cake come out evenly brown as well as yummy and moist! I purchased an ordinary bundt pan right before this and it was ruined after my first use. This one is heavy duty and. Non stick as indicated exactly in the product description. For one who loves to bake, this pan and I are good friends!"
2,LOL!!,I just rented this movie the other day and I thought it was hilarious. At first when I heard about the movie I thought it would have been cheesy. To my surprise the movie was hilarious. After thinking about it I realzed that the movie couldn't be that bad b/c Steve Carell from 40yr old Virgin was in it. The funniest part of the movie was the end!!! That little girl is hilarious. Please go see the movie. Definately worth it.
2,Cutting Edge,"I was hesitate to order a cheese knife online but when I couldn't locate one like mine in the store, I decided to order this one. It turns out, it is nicer than my other one! Nicely constructed and should last for years to come. I was pleased to give it as a gift and if mine ever dies, I'll order this one again."
2,Very interesting,"I enjoyed the book, but I was ready to tell Dr Charlene a thing or two; From the way the book ended, I have a feeling that we will be hearing some more from her camp in a bit; But, she is one of those women who just don't learn their lesson after it's taught; Going from man to man and not learning nothing but to stay on top and ahead of the game; She had no feelings for hurting Richard. all she wanted was to get a job after all but screwing her career. But enough of her; Of course, seeing Richard and Nina finally get married made me glad; Of course, they were some twists to the story with Gracie's divorce and downfall, as well as Nathan trying to adjust from his mother's passing; Estelle and Justine was only mentioned in passing and that was only because of Nathan's as well as another surprising twist; Won't spoil it for those who didn't read it; But a worthwhile read; Enjoy."
2,Easy to use,Attracts the hummers amd keeps them around. Much easier to clean than the glass bottle variety.
2,DVD Contents,"This DVD will include a documentary about the band entitled ""Paris Before the War,"" music videos for ""The Tain"", ""The Bachelor and the Bride"", ""16 Military Wives"", ""The Soldiering Life"", and ""Here I Dreamt I Was an Architect"", and the entirety of their concert at the Roseland Theater in Portland on the 4th of November 2005.Tracklisting for the concert portion is as follows:01 The Infanta02 The Soldiering Life03 Leslie Anne Levine04 We Both Go Down Together05 The Engine Driver06 Eli the Barrow Boy07 The Sporting Life08 July, July!09 16 Military Wives10 The Mariner's Revenge Song11 The Chimbley Sweep12 I Was Meant for the Stage"
2,Liked it,"I liked this book and will look for other Laurie Graham books. My only nit-picking is: I'd give it 5 stars if the ""English"" dialogue didn't sound exactly like the American--- an Englsih country woman certainly wouldn't use the same words and phrases as a American/Texan. (I've lived in both places)Other than that, I enjoyed the writing, and the story of just some regular gals married to some regular guys trying to make the best of things. Nothing too fancy, just a slice of life."
2,Great workout !,"I love this DVD ! It's short but tough and challenging. I felt relaxed and yet full of energy afterwards. The cueing is great as well, as I'm pretty new to yoga, I had no problems following this one. I like the fact that I'm reminded to breath and focus throughout the routine. This DVD's a keeper !"
2,Gas Stove Ribs,I ordered these in hopes that my clean up time and the damage done to the surface of the burners would be easier. I have to say it made a lot of difference. They protect the surface and make cleaning up so much easier. I forgot to mention that the stove top is whate which makes it even more challeningThe only complaint I have is these burners didn't fit the smaller size eyes but I put foil around them and then added the bibs witch works fine.
2,This rack is great with the MTX bags! Has held up well for 19 months of hard use.,Have had this for 19 months along with the Topeak MTX DTX bag. It's a great system. It's been durable and is still working great after hundreds of commutes and grocery runs. Very easy to use.
2,"Perfect ""first Bible"" for children!","This is the perfect ""first Bible"" for children. The pictures are bright and colorful, the handle is easy to hold and the hard back holds up to many drops!"
2,Samsung DLP TV Stand,The stand matches the TV perfectly (I have the HL-S5086W). Assembly is a bit involved. I'm a mechanic and it took me nearly two hours to assemble. Assembly is not for the faint of heart. It is very strong once assembled.
2,It's great!,My 12 yrs. old lab mix(Theo) has the usual stiff joints. I had tried many variations of meds. NaturVet was suggested by a local pet store. I firmly believe it has help keep Theo young. He still does his happy dog dance every morning and enjoys our mile and a half jog.
2,Good update,We were using 2003 version and decided it was time to upgrade and I think it was worthwhile; all the reports and features are fresh and clean.
2,"This first ""talkie"" version is still the best.","Take nothing away from Kevin Costner or Sean Connery's Robin. They are very good. Errol Flynn was my first Robin as a child, again very recently & many times in between. It's lush, extravagant & colorful. Let's not forget those great characters of the 30's; Alan Hale, Claude Rains, Basil Rathbone etc. Then there is of course the mega watt beauty of a young Olivia deHavilland.You can't have enough Rovin Hood movies, & for sheer romantic, fun & entertainment, this is the one."
2,A lot of good stuff in here to help deal with meth abuse.,"I bought this book to get help for someone I care about who's been on meth for over 2 years. I loved how the author used so much of his personal life to explain what meth does to the user. I do have a better understanding of the drug and will use so much of the advice given, especially the stuff from ""Things for Family"". This book quotes a lot of bible scriptures but the meanings of them are very relevant to the subjects discussed. I would have rated it a full 5 stars but I would have liked the chapters to be more than 2-3 pages long. I read it cover to cover in about 2 1/2 hours. Still an excellent book and will reccommend to others."
2,working your way to the top of the mob.,"Little Caesar is a great example of what it takes to survive in the world of organised crime, and shows whsat goes on in the minds of criminals like me. 4 stars cause of the cliff-hanger ending,but still a must read."
2,KEPT IT WARM,THIS WARMING TRAY DID JUST AS IT SHOULD. IT KEPT MY APPETIZERS WARM THRU A 4 HOUR PARTY. I AM VERY PLEASED.
2,Cool Toy!!,"This is a very cool toy. My daughter got it for her 1st birthday. There were alot of older kids ranging from 1 1/2yrs to 8yrs old. They all loved it as a matter of fact they would fight over it. The next day my 1yr old played with it and loved it, it is soooo much fun to see her face light up when she makes the music come on. The only reason I gave this 4 stars is because it is difficult to push the balls through the middle. Of course this is where she insists the balls go. But she gets frustrated because she can't push them through and she cannot get them back out! When this happens the music buttons come in handy."
2,Love My Mixer,I received my Kitchenaid Mixer as a Christmas gift from my husband. I had wanted one for years. I used the mixer for the first time Christmas Eve and was thrilled with it! The mixer is so easy to use; no more holding a mixer by hand! It was so fast at whipping egg whites; in less than 2 minutes the peaks were stiff and ready. It takes much longer with a hand mixer. I love this mixer and would highly recommend the KitchenAid Mixer for anyone wishing to purchase one.
2,Learn what an Intercessor is.,"There are so many truths revealed in this book, but one which was so precious to me was learning how to become an Intercessor. I found out that, as I yield myself as a vessel of prayer, I can pray for other's needs even when I don't know who they are or what their needs are. This is done as God's spirit flows through me in prayer. What a beautiful time this is too when you are along with God, weeping and yielding yourself in the spiritperhaps for a young person in trouble, maybe for someone who is being persecuted in a foreign country, a loved one,...who knows but the spirit of God!"
2,A lot of popcorn,"Let me tell you. Six boxes of kettle korn is mucho popcorn. I bought all this popcorn late at night a few months ago. I was not Above the Influence at the time. Hence (seemingly) infinity popcorn.I've made it through about half the boxes of popcorn. Thankfully, it's pretty good popcorn. Salt and sweet is always a fun combination.Would I buy 36 popcorn bags at once again? Probably not. Do I flat regret my purchase? No, it makes my girlfriend laugh when she brings it up. And we both love kettle korn."
2,Excellent!,"I was just checking to make sure the book is still available on Amazon. I have recommended it to so many people through the years. I was very startled that there were negative reviews. I have been doing many of the exercises for about 14 years. I am much stronger and healthier. My flexibility, balance, and posture are much better. I did not lose any weight, but I did have to get a new wardrobe, a size smaller. My left hip is arthritic and my left leg has issues, but only when I fail to do the exercises for a few days. I feel no pain or discomfort at all when I am faithful to my routine. I like not needing to go to the gym for this. I am 63. I know people my age and younger pop pills for pain I would have if I chose that route."
2,Loved IT!,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Learned alot and would recommend it. As a wife, mother, daughter and daughter-in-law of Navy person it gave me great insight."
2,Interesting and entertaining.,"This was the first book I have ever read about the history of the beauty industry. I really enjoyed it and I thought that it had a lot of interesting information. My only complaint is that the book did not go into a lot of detail about hair products, there was a whole chapter about hair removal techniques but there wasn't any information about hair dye, hair curlers, ect. I wish that the book would have gone into more depth about those subjects."
2,Great!,"This is a great kid's book that I enjoyed as a child, and now my daughter will also get to enjoy it. Thanks."
2,"An Adorable, Fun and Easy Read!! Perfect for a vacation!","I don't think anyone pretended that The Nanny Diaries was the great American novel! I read this darling book on the outside deck of a cruise ship. This is the perfect book to read when there are a lot of distractions (like beautiful views). It was easy to get into and there are not a lot of characters to keep up with. The writing is crisp and fast paced. Since my life is so far removed from the X's, I enjoyed reading about the rich and famous (are there really people like that?)."
2,great lullabyes,My kids love it. They listen to it before they go to sleep at night. It makes bedtime easier!
2,Perfect for it's function,"My wife and I both have one and we use it for our laptops. It serves its intended purpose perfectly. It's adjustable height and tilt make getting the right spot easy.If you're looking for a perfectly flat top or something that you can set 135123 lbs on, this might not be the item for you."
2,Better than the Pullout Disconnect,I did have a disconnect for my hot tub that used a removable disconnect. It was hard to remove until it melted and then it was impossible. This device is as easy as a circuit breaker to turn on and off. I suppose it will still melt if there is a wiring problem. Make sure you cut the wires with some slack for a bend so that when they contract in cold weather they won't pull out.
2,Optics are great,"Not sure if it is worth over $300, but the clarity is great. It should be waterproof though."
2,Exactly what i wanted,"Pros: Good fan speed to fan size ratio, fairly quiet for a cheap fan, Clip mounting very efficientCons: Its a cheap small desk fan, dont expect a super high speed silent vortex of wind coming at you, No oscillationUse: I use this in my garden attached to a pole to get air movement on my plants. effectively it can move air in about a 3 foot space with most of the power in the 1-15 inch range. easy to install and fast delivery."
2,great collectible,I have been A Tron fan forever. when I found out about Tron: Legacy I had to go see it then I had to have it so I got it. The tron: Legacy collectible is great. I did not know that the identity disc would be so cool and that the five disc are placed inside and the disc lights up just like in tron.I'm haveing lots of fun. I love the Tron: Legacy colletible. Have Fun Program.
2,Sounds Of The Street,"Streetlife Serenade contains some of the best lyrics on any Billy Joel album. Many of the songs are sung in the first person and it gives them a certain intimacy. ""Streetlife Serenader"" starts the album on a soft note and ""Los Angeleanos"" wryly mocks the denizens of L.A. ""The Great Suburban Showdown"" is a humorous tale of man heading back to his hometown to spend time with his parents and ""Root Beer Rag"" is an instrumental where Mr. Joel shows off his piano chops. ""Roberta"" is a good song about a lady of the night while album's hit single ""The Entertainer"" is a sarcastic look at show business. ""The Last Of The Big Time Spenders"" and ""Weekend Song"" are good songs while ""Souvenir"" is a poignant look at how life can pass you by and all you have left are the memories. ""The Mexican Connection"" is another instrumental that closes out the album. Streetlife Serenade is another classic Billy Joel record."
2,The best of the best,This book is outstanding just like his first one. You can't go wrong with Harrington. This book will take your game to a whole new level.
2,Easy install,"I think these could be shipped more securely since they are heavy. Otherwise, a good replacement. I had the most trouble taking out the old ones."
2,Beautiful but currently negleted opera.,"Martha is one of the most tuneful operas ever written. In the 19th century -- and even in the first half of the 20th century -- its beauty made it a favorite in Germany and reasonably popular in the U.S. Unfortunately, the old-fashioned romance of its plot has caused Martha to fall out of favor in these unromantic times. But the melodic beauty of Martha is as appealing now as it ever was if you will listen to it without bias. I love this beautiful opera and I think you may too. This version is the only one currently abvailable, to the best of my knowledge. It is a re-release on CDs of a performance from the 1940s (hence the four stars for this five-star opera). But the remastering is quite acceptable -- and the opera is beautiful."
2,Flawless,"This book will always be for me the ultimate thriller. Flawlessly executed on every level, the story grabbed me by the lapels and smashed my spine against the wall until I'd read the very last word. Unbelievably good in every way possible -- from procedural to character to dialogue, pacing and originality -- the book is the best in the genre. In a somewhat unprecedented move, Harris is being awarded a Lifetime Achievement award from the Horror Writers Association. I can understand why. He's a master storyteller who has penetrated our culture and consciousness like no other."
2,Useful information for this critical stage,"My wife and I got the workbook and tapes of this entry into the Ezzo's famous ""-Wise"" series, and were very happy with it. We used their BabyWise principles with our little ones, and found it solid ground for our parenting. Now they are in school and getting more independent every day. We returned the tried and true ""Ezzo books"" as my wife calls them.We particularly liked the teachings on moving toward ""influence"" as the child grows. No longer does the child spend most of his time at home, but outside the home - where direct control and supervision is not possible. As Christians, we also took comfort in their direction to helping our children be Godly young men.The teenage years can be the best!"
2,I Will Promise You,"I've only recently been watching K-dramas, and I purchased ""You're Beautiful"" along with ""Boys Over Flowers"". I feel in love with ""Boys Over Flowers"" instantaneously, so my expectations for your ""You're Beautiful"" were pretty high, and I wasn't disappointed. The music is catchy, the acting at times is a little over the top, but I've come to expect that with Korean dramas, and if you don't fall in love with the A.N.JELL's then something is seriously wrong with you. The characters of Shinwoo, Jeremy, and Taekyung all have their tender moments with Minam that will leave you on the brink of tears-especially Jeremy's bus (You have to buy it, sorry no spoilers here). This is a definite must have to any DVD collection. Highly recommended!!"
2,Sanus VMPL250B Very Straightforward,"I found this product to be everything that it says. Once we found the studs mounting it was a matter of minutes. The caveat that I was made aware of was to plug in all of your cords before mounting as the television mounts very close to the wall. Any future cords will require you to dismount the television, add the plug-in, and remount. I am very happy with this product and highly recommend it."
2,The best electronic chaos from the UK!!,"Inertia stars frontman Reza Udhin on Vox, the stunning Alexys B on E-drums and vox, Eddie Tempest on Analogue synths and Ed Luxmoore on digital synths. By far the best Electro-Industrial band to break out of the UK. Their website spans a history of tours that has taken them around the world and back no less than 3 times covering grounds in the US, UK, Europe, and Scandinavia. This album combines powerful electro beats with a wave of blips and bleeps and gowling male vocals loud enough to shake the continent together with soulful melodic female harmonies. For those of you into F242, KMFDM, & FLA. Not for the weak-hearted."
2,An unexpected gem!,"I always loved William Castle movies but I did not think this could be such a great release. I ordered and watched it with middle interest but after all I was fully satisfied. Orginal idea and great release. It become one of my preferred Castle's movies along with The Night Walker. This is a great surprise, an unexpected gem!"
2,Worked as expected,These cables are a bit expensive compared to other usb camera cables but Kodak made their's just a bit different so the cheaper ones won't work...This cable does what it is supposed to do...
2,Still the best,Love these books the third time through. Had to replace the set I gave my mother. Gotta finish reading before the final book comes out in July.
2,cool,"great zombies map, new weapon and New Maps for multiplayer not a bad day at the ball park I'd say"
2,DL DVD...superb,IF youre in need of DL DVD's these are the ones to get.didnt have one burn fail :)Id higly recommend these
2,great chairs,They are sturdy and fairly comfortable considering they are not cushioned ones and they match what was already in use.
2,"Great quality, nice and big.",This pad is very nice quality with appropriate thickness and nice and large. My only worry is that the material that is on top may stain after being soiled. It has yet to be soiled so I cannot be sure. It feels like a cotton-type of material. The bottom material does feel like it would keep any stains away from the surface you are trying to protect.
2,Female star takes credit in Midnight Man,A great storyline idea by Jack Higgins. This thriller concentrates on the relationships between the leading characters. This is at its very best when Su Yin (played by Daphne Cheung) illuminates the screen with her presence. This is a must see movie for Miss Cheung's contribution alone. Kenneth Cranham (Respected British stage and TV actor) also makes a valuable contribution to this very watchable film.
2,this album needs more recognition,"this album is mostly filled with r&b/soul/jazz songs with only several hip hop sounding songs, including the leading single please, which is brilliant. The video is very creatively done and the strings hook is so catchy. The second single trippin has a beautiful piano hook too and I hope more people buy it and contribute to the sales of this wonderfully crafted album from toni braxton. Her last album was more musically diverse than her others and most people didn't enjoy it, but if you like her first 3 albums this is a must have album."
2,Great while they worked,"They are comfortable and sound considerably better than the earbuds that came with my player. The cord is a nice length, too, and I like the L-shaped plug. I'm sure there are much better earphones out there, but for under $10, I think these are a great buy.UPDATE: After a year and a half, the left side no longer works. Not sure if the cause is in the earbud itself or the plug, but either way, I can no longer use them. I did use them a lot and take them around everywhere, and apparently it is not uncommon for earphones to fail after this much time. All in all, I would probably purchase them again."
2,Sharpies,"Sharpies always get five stars from me. There is no better pen for editing or for putting a permanent mark with. The thinner point markers are more like pens and can be used for anything you would use a pen on. They do bleed through thin paper, though."
2,I did not whant this game to end!!!!,"This game is the best game I have ever played. 30-40 hours of game play at least. The graphics are reallly good for a game this long. The plot is the best ever. The fighting system is a little difficult to learn but once you get it it's great. All of the characters are intuitive and fun.The only problem is the voice acting is sparce to none it is truly sad, but if just that is stoping you from buying it then you're a sad, sad person.IF you are even thinking about getting this game( and even if your not) go buy it now!! STOP sitting there reading this and go,go buy it, get it now!! it's the best thing that you will ever do!"
2,Still a good video,"I went to Blockbuster Video and rented this tape, when i saw it, i saw Fred Hickman (pre-More Than A Game) as he guided me to the best plays ever. CNN knew Sports Tonight before it pulled the plug for good. I like him in More Than a Game. It was a great show before Brandi (not shirtless) Chastain took over. You can still see Sports Tonight on CNNSI Cable. May the POD be with you."
2,Actually Purchased Blue Nitrates And Without Powdder,What Purchased were Srong and Very GoodNot Latex and Powderd.Your caption of latex and with powder is not correct
2,Columbo is great but the set....,"Columbo is great, we all know that. I will not get into describing the films... The only thing I wanted to add is that this set has only 3 discs not 6 as the Amazon description says. Other than that is awesome."
2,Great Magazine,"I have been reading this magazine for three years now. It has scientific, tested, and proven articles. None of the racy, superficial, brainless, sex fluff that other women's magazines try to push. You feel sexy by eating right, exercising, and learning how to treat your body well. That's what real women want to read about."
2,Works well considering the price point.,"I have this tuner plugged into my Sony 36"" XBR's component inputs (Video 5) and the picture is superb. I'm using a typical rooftop antenna nearly 50 miles from the Phoenix area broadcast towers, and they are not line-of-sight; I'm behind a mountain! Nevertheless, this unit found about 7 HDTV channels for all the major networks and a few others without any problems. (sadly, not our educational channel on 8) Yes, it is slow to start the decode to send to the TV, and the search for channels is slow, but once set up, I've been very pleased with the performance. Considering what the prices used to be, I think this unit is good value. I paid about $280 for a refurb unit."
2,Wow Pretty good,"I haven't heard It Dies Today's new CD but this album is pretty extreme. There is a lot of Gothenburg influence here but what really struck out to me was their long songs and absolutely brutal breakdowns. This is an emotional CD but it never gets too whiny or too emo-ey in fact there is only like 30 seconds of clean singing total on this CD. What really stands out is the breakdowns, and the singer's brutal death metal voice during these earth-crushing breakdowns. Unlike some hardcore bands, these guys break it down like 5 or 6 times per song, so get ready. Good band, but On Broken Wings owns the whole metalcore scene in my opinion."
2,I think I like it.,I think I like it. Well I like it- but it's hard to get way into this one. In one way it 'takes one away' and in another way- it doesn't go far enough in that regard. So you are stuck about 2/3 the way there. Know what I mean?
2,15th Century history relative to the printing press,"So little is known about Johann Gutenberg that rather than limit the book to what is documented about Gutenberg, the author provides the background 15th century political and religious history of the area, the specific history of script manuscripts and printing, and finally integrating what can be assumed and is known about Gutenberg. While the author seemed to ramble at times as he ties everything together, the background history is valuable in understanding the development of the printing process and understanding the impact this invention had on society, particularly the protestant separation from the Catholic Church."
2,Finally a Star Trek book about ships!,I was very happy to see this book at my local book store the other day and I was happy with alot of the pictures and the ship info. Sadly I wish there would have been even more ships. They only seemed to brush the surface.
2,7mm CZ earrings,"Great buy! Very bright, sparkly! They tend to hang down because of their size, weight and small earring back/clasp. Recommend using a larger (disc) back."
2,Its haunting,This book is not for the faint of heart (or stomach). In the first chapter i will admit i was a bit bored but after the third i was hooked! I hope you will enjoy it as much as I did.
2,Great Sound,"My husband and I really enjoy this CD. He is South African and we've had a tough time finding some traditional African music that captures the beautiful resonance of the voices you hear there. This disc is the closest we've gotten, many enjoyable tracks. We chose one for the recessional at our wedding so it will always be a special one for us!"
2,Hits the spot,"That is, if you have a late night craving for some ultra technical/uber brutal death metal that sounds like the unholy child of Suffocation and Gorguts. And all this from a group of Swedes?! I thought they were only concerned with making melodic death metal and black metal...haha...proved me wrong. What a satisfyingly tasty death metal cd.Mmmmm."
2,"Fun, but Sad","this book was relly well writen and soo funny, although when you think about it you shouldent be laughing. i recommend theas books for children and adults alike!!!!! The only reason I gave the book 4 *stars was becaus I've read the whole series so far and after a while the storie is a little predictibul."
2,Awesome,"I've had this for about a year and a half now, and it still works great. I've dropped this hundreds of times and there's no signs of damage.I love the extra buttons, too. I never use the free scroll, though.It's not wonderful for really really long periods of use, like literally all day long for multiple days in a row, but I think you would be hard pressed to find one that was.The battery life is great, too, I've only had to replace the batteries once or twice since I got it, and sometimes I forget to turn off the mouse and leave it on all night.Overall a great buy and I would definitely recommend it."
2,A MASTERPIECE ONLY TRENT COULD PULL OFF,Trent did a great job w/ this and if u r wondering if u should buy if well..if you like industrial and u like the big bands like KMFDM and SkinnyPuppy that inspired this guy buy the CD and all of his others.Trent is simply one of the best along w/ nivek and sache
2,Rivating and Intriguing,"This has been the best book I have ever read. It only took me three days to read, normally it takes me about three weeks to read a book. I just could not put the book down. I read it at work at home and in the car. When is the sequel coming out????????????I can not wait"
2,close shave,I have had this Braun series 1 for a few weeks now and I can honestly say this is the best electric razer I have ever owned. The charge lasts twice as long as my old Norelco and shaves almost as close as a blade. It has a natural fit into my hand and does not take nearly as long to shave as my old one. My only gripe is it should have come with a pouch or case to store it in.
2,A very beautiful edition,"Reading this elegant and attractive book, along with the 200th anniversary of the book, has a very special effect and meaning. I am currently rereading the book, and find it more beautiful and more intimate."
2,She's back,"I'm a big fan of Everybody loves Raymond and Patricia Heaton is one of my favorite actresses. I love her as Debra Barone, and now I have another reason to love her more as Kelly Carr on Back to you.She is so sexy! I have the complete series of Everybody loves Raymond, and now I hope to collect the complete series of Back to you.This show is very funny, and I hope this show won't go the way of many shows cancelation. If you love Everybody loves Raymond, give this show a chance.Thanks Alan Moore"
2,He shot in the dark........ and hit it !,"Outstanding!!!! King says in the preface he found this system of little books interesting, and that he would literally shoot in the dark, and in my opinion (and almost everyone's), he hit it! This way, the reading doesn't get tiring and you get more interested (I would say... desperat!!) in the story because you don't have the next chapters!!! The story, in other hand, is very well conducted. You will love the mouse!A work of art!!!"
2,Never practice lawschool Armin!,"You should stick with what you're doing now. Mixing great albums, remixing good tunes and rocking the world as a deejay. This CD though only has a good A-side, the B-side is not that good. However the A-side makes more than good. Top tracks by the uber-talented James Holden and a remix of the loveparade classic techno stomper; Der Klang der Familie by Dr. Motte.Rush to the store to buy"
2,The 48 Laws of Power,Great book. Easy to remember examples. Read it repeatedly to allow the rules to become second nature.
2,alfie einstein :),"Alfie is another british band with an unexplainable amount of talent. Unexplainable because it seems most british groups are ingenious in their own way. Where did they get it from? Who knows? But i do know that us rebels over here in the beautiful u.s., took only a bit of that musical ingenuity when crossing the big pond back in the day. Okay, all gawking aside, i must admit that alfie's lead singer reminds me slightly of the lead singer of ""they might be giants"". That's a good thing if you like (or can tolerate) ""they might be giants"". Luckily i grew up listening to my sisters collection of music, and t.m.b.g. happened to be in the mix. So alfie, like you might expect, is ingenious (on tracks 2 & 3 inparticular) and a bit quirky (especially the vocals(all tracks)). But don't buy this album because you want good, strange music, buy it because it's good, mellow music with great instrumentation and a unique sound."
2,"Interesting , original plot",I enjoyed both this sequel and the original which I recommended to my book club. I liked the originality of the plot and find Dexter endearing with his family loyalty.
2,Wonderful gift for the teacher in your life..,I am a third grade teacher and I received this gift from my principal. The photographer spoke to our staff. He was a wonderful speaker who really cared about his subjects. He even took the time to meet each of us and autograph our books. I recommend it for any teacher. It'll make you have good feelings about the profession that you are in.
2,A gift for my secretary,"I purchased this gift for one of my secreataries because of a story she told me about having a mouse climb up on the dash of her car while she was driving into work one day. She carefully pulled over, got out of the car, went to the passenger side door and opened it, and told the little guy to get out of her car. the mouse jump down off the dash, and ran. she came on into work. She is a real trooper. I bought the puppet and placed it on her work PC with a note saying: ""Hi Phyllis, I'm back!"". We had a huge laugh and wondered if the little guy is still jumping into cars for rides."
2,Red Tent,"This book was a wonderful interpretation of the Bible Story of Jacob and his family. Anita Diamant reads between the lines of some of the questionable bible stories, and fills in what others may have suspected. It is a modern interpretation of bibical stories, which I suspect is exactly the way that the bible was interpreted throughout the ages. We will never know the truth about what really happened, but this view seems much more likely than the one we are led to believe in the Bible. It's hard to believe that the Bible in its present form is the divine word of God, with all the horendous crimes that were justified in it. Anita tells it the way we would assume the story of Dinah must have happened in her affair with Shalem at Shechem."
2,My favorite kettle corn...,"I'm a huge fan of kettle corn, and this brand is definitely top notch. My favorite of all brands! You can't go wrong with Orville..."
2,Very Exciting,"I had to read this book for school, and I really liked it. It told a lot of the hardships that Tony and Cindy went through when they were lost. It also gave me some idea's about what to do if I am ever in that situation. It had some twists like when the snowmobilers came and past, not even seeing them. If I had been in that situation I would have been bored out of my mind, and scared out of my wits. I recommend this to anyone who likes stories about survival."
2,Cushion for one's tailbone,"I have a tailbone that hurts me when I sit, especially on some surfaces. The cushion has helped me."
2,A Beat Poetry Classic,"This was the first Beat book of poetry I ever read, in my teens, and I felt compelled to read more. So I moved on to Ginsberg, and others. There's a poem in this collection that I get a real kick out of and I absolutely love. It's called ""Marriage."" Very funny and amusing. These poems are really unconventional and highly imaginative in their use of language and free form.David Rehakauthor of ""Poems From My Bleeding Heart"""
2,works great,i bought this stethoscope because the one i had wasn't good and plus it broke. it's lightweight and the earplugs are soft and don't hurt like others would and the sound is great. i like it so much that i bought an extra one for my aunt because she was going to the medical field as well.
2,Put this fur in your ears,"Phantom Power is an incredible joyride through some truly unique musical terrain. You hear comparisons with the Beatles, Byrds, Neil Young, etc.. but the Furries have a sound which is really their own. The songs are densely produced but the density never seems overdone or superfluous. The melodies are by turns sweeping, haunting, playful, but always beautiful. The songs range in style pretty widely, but there is a pervasive mood which holds the album together. It's got some dark themes, but these are dark times we live in, and overall it seems to be an album more about fighting back than despairing. I can listen to Phantom Power over and over and never tire of it. Buy it immediately!"
2,love these sheets!,I love these sheets! They are so soft to slide into at night after a long day. I'm currently sleeping on an air mattress until I pick out a new bed so at least having nice sheets is a good thing.
2,Kitchen Aid KHM9PWH Hand Mixer,"Hand mixer is a nice weight which accomplishes the job. Only complaint I have is the cord, wish that it rotated so that it would be more manageable. Also wish that the mixer came with a whisk attachment however I think that can be purchased separately. All and all the mixer works great and doesn't bog down when mixing dense mixes."
2,Good Beside Table Read,"Being Italian, I have a great interest in this material. However, this is not a book you can sit down and read like a novel. I recomend that you put it on you your nighstand and read a chapter a night. We Italians really RULE!!!"
2,"Good, as usual.","Very good in the sequel line, but I figured out ""who dun it"" before I finished. The characters are still developing well, waiting for the next one. I have the whole series."
2,Thanks Bob,Bob Newhart is one of the all time greats. This books does an excellent job displaying Bob's sense of humor.
2,Great product once it works...,"The iPod works great once you get it started for Windows. It took me several trips to the iPod store to get it fixed and working for my PC with iTunes. Once running, I have had no issues with it and am very satisfied. The hardest part was all the setup involved between iTunes and getting problems fixed initially."
2,"Good product, but did nothing to stave away feeling of emptiness","I've tried various hair products. Some nourish my hair, and leave it smooth, allowing me to momentarily ignore the fact that we all die alone. Some leave my hair a little greasy, which simply serves as a staunch reminder of my mortality.This conditioner leaves my hair smooth and healthy, and I love the scent. Unfortunately, it does nothing to fill the hole I fear I'll always have in my heart, the empty void that can't be filled by anything purchasable. Perhaps one day I will find a hair product that makes me feel whole, but for now I'll make do with a conditioner that makes my hair look and smell good."
2,Folky,"I found this cd to learn more towards folk. There were a few popish tunes, but interesting for the most part. This was the first time I had actually listened to Jess and have been quite pleased with it. Worth a listen."
2,a mom's review,"Who wouldn't want to do this?A great novel about an independent boy living on his own off the land. It is hard to find good literature for boys. I grew up with ""Anne of Green Gables"" and the Noel Streatfield books - but those aren't going to appeal to boys.This book would make an excellent gift for any boy. Read it out loud to your family."
2,tear jerker,It took me a long time to be able to read this book without crying as I used to read it to our daughter who will never grow old as she's passed away.
2,"Small book, big story.","If something is very good or conversely very bad it isn't necessary to bang out a lot of words to express an opinion. The work stands or falls of its own accord.'The Shamanic Way of the Bee' is a very good book. It works on several levels. It's the story of a students relationship with his teacher, it's the story of communication between one species and another not by talking but by listening and observing, and finally it's the story of ancient shamanic craft.Hell, I even thing it would make a good film."
2,Great to be back in the 80s,"I really enjoyed watching Scarecrow and Mrs King. Adventures, suspense, romance; everything was just fine! Besides, as I'm French, it was the opportunity to hear the players' real voice and the genuine dialogues.There really were delightful hours. I cannot stand waiting for seasons 3 and 4!"
2,A leader in the renaissance of Spanish music,"Manuel de Falla is considered to be the central figure in the renaissance of Spanish music that took place during the opening decades of the twentieth century. He drew upon many traditions including gypsy music and folk song and dance. While living in Paris he was encouraged by Debussy and Ravel. This is a two CD set and the first CD contains the Nights in the Gardens of Spain, my favorite work by Falla. The music is varied, shifting from one pleasant interlude to another. The second CD has The Three Cornered Hat, music for ballet that was first performed in 1919 in London with sets by Picasso. The ballet is about a jealous miller who has unfounded suspicion of his young beautiful wife. Falla's work often consists of reinterpretation and reinvention of the historic music of Spain, baroque or religious, folk or country fare. Some of the work is a bit too modernist for me but the primary compositions listed above are very enjoyable."
2,As advertised,"I bought this to connect my computer to my 50"" plasma TV. It works and is easy to install. My TV has the correct video input. At 25' it is pretty long, so understand what you are getting. The best review I can give a product is that it does what it said it would. This does."
2,Find your Reward,"Foo Fighters first album was full of catchy tunes and a great album to listen to but ""The Colour & the Shape *explitive deleted* rocks. This album gets a solid 4 stars just on the strength of ""My Hero"", ""Everlong"" (btw- one of the best videos I've ever seen) and ""Hey, Johnny Park"". Those songs rock with so hard and have so much power they make up for the rest of the album being just good. Dave Grohl apparently learned something sitting behind Kurt Cobain for 5 years and when he puts it together with his knack for catchy hooks you got a couple of kick @$$ tunes. (If Baker Street was on the album it might almost be worth 5 stars)"
2,XM INNO2 CAR Install Kit,"Not a problem with the car kit. Installation was straight forward... The ""Sure Connect"" component works both ways...meaning you can connect (clip mount) it to the FM antenna and route it thru the car to the XM receiver, or, as I found, you can clip it to exposed (bare) metal under the dash. I clipped it to the steering wheel bracing (under the dash) and it worked fine. The only drawback to this is the slight interference (static) you receive when passing under overhead electrical lines....To solve that problem I disconnected the ""Sure Connect"" component and installed the FM Coupler component (separate purchase @$35).....no more static and clear reception...Problem solved...XM is the BEST....now, if they would only figure out how to get XM TV working we'd be set....."
2,"clear illustrations, directions and descriptions","I loved this book when I used it for class, and kept it for reference afterwards. I really liked how direct and clear the infomation was, I felt that if the need arose, I would be able to appropriately execute a new restraint, etc based on this book. It has a good deal of very relevant information, especially for someone who might not be as familiar with handling a species, for instance a cow person who needs to help someone with their swine. And for someone who might not have been around livestock, there is a lot to learn as well with plenty of illustrations so even if you are still learning the terminology you can see what is being described."
2,A classic film gets the Criterion treatment,"This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film.The Spy Who Came in from the Cold, is based on the novel of the same name by John le Carré. It is about a spy in Berlin who goes into 'forced' retirement and works in a library. He becomes a drunkard but it is later revealed his 'retirement' was only cover to become a double agent for the East Germans. He then falsely defects to East Germany so he can do one last mission.I liked the film a lot and enjoyed the dialogue too. The Criterion edition is a two disc set with great bonus material.Disc one contains the film with the theatrical trailer, Disc two contains audio commentary by Oswald Morris of selected scenes, a 2000 BBC special about le Carré, a gallery of set designs, and a 1985 conversation between between director Martin Ritt and film historian Patrick McGilligan."
2,My opinion,Vygotsky and Piaget are the forerunners in today's educational thinking. Even though they lived a long time ago they are still focused on in educational thinking. Piaget and Stern theories about language and development are included. The book is all emcompassing with language development and thinking . If you need to know about language development this is the book you should be reading.
2,Easy read and useful summary,"I read this book in two days. Very easy read and good summary of Islamic history and the evolution to Islamic radicalism and terrorism. Also very good summary of Islamic and Saudi history. Very relevant and scary book given the ongoing global terrorism sponsored ny Islamic extremists. One point that sticks: ""the basic unit of global relevance is the ""nation"" which can be broekn down into religions. However, in Islam, we have a global religion which is then broken down into nations."""
2,"Feynman never got out of his box, because he never had one!","Part physicist, part prankster, part musician, part teacher, part genius, part story teller, part little boy and all human being, this is the true story of Richard Feynman. He was a man with an insatiable curiosity, and had a zest to explore the world of physics, human nature and himself.The stories in the book are funny, entertaining and enlightening. Feynman never got out of his box, because he never had one. From the gifted young boy who fixed radios by thinking to the top notch physicist who could explain concepts to laymen like no one else, Feynman was one of a kind.Well worth the read!The Re-Discovery of Common Sense: A Guide to: The Lost Art of Critical Thinking"
2,Live Like You Mean It: Seven Celebrations to Rejuvenate Your Soul,One of the most encouraging and uplifting books I have read in a long time! Life needs to be lived on purpose despite the struggles you may be going through.
2,What a great recording,"I love the show and this recording is awesome with the 96' cast including Nathan Lane. I especially enjoy ""Comedy Tonight"". Enjoy!!"
2,"Easy to make, Authentic Tasting Recipes","Betty Crocker's International Cookbook by Betty Crocker. This book has lots of great recipes in it, including a great Szechwan Chicken recipe and a simple Cream of Mushroom soup recipe that I love. I've tried many of the recipes in this book, and, in general, I like them. My edition is the 1980 hardcover edition, which is now out of print. My copy of this one is falling apart, and I have difficulty keeping all the pages in order in it."
2,Cold Mountain / Cool Price,"An exceptional book at a great price. With ""Kindle"" Up and coming as the Library you can hold in you hand; Real books,be it hardback or paperback,are going the way of 8/tracks and cassettes. Good to know you can stillget a good value for your buck."
2,It's a Handball,"Although the picture says Red Ace I received a Men's 21 ace ball so take caution if that matters to you. I prefer a 21 ace anyway so I'm fine with it. It's a USHA hand ball and it does the job, can't ask for more."
2,3 Miles... PFT,"ooorah! I love this album. A friend let me listen to it, and now that I have my own, it's constantly on repeat. The cadences are well paced, and the DI's and recruits have a lot of heart. The cadences are clean and appropriate for all ages. Extremely motivating. Keeps you running for miles!"
2,Great First Toy!,"My son is 3 months old and loves the giggle ball. I can see why it might not be fun for an older baby but I definitely recommend this toy as a first toy for younger babies. I wouldn't call it just a rattle, it's more interactive and holds babies attentions much longer. Rattles don't interest my son in the slightest but the giggle ball makes him laugh and laugh. What I really like about it is that it's easy for his tiny hands to grab a hold of and shake with both of his hands."
2,Happy with my AudioBook,Shipping was fast and product was in described condition! Thank you!! I enjoyed this audiobook very much. It was nice to be able to find the book I was looking for and at a decent price.
2,Pioneer PD -M426 6 disc magazine CD player,This CD player is the absolute best. Our first one lasted 15+ yrs so we were delighted to find another @ Amazon. So very simple to use & great quality.
2,Amazing!,I had to cop this one! How could you not! It's Rakim y Ken-Y!Amazing tracks:DimeDame Lo Que Quieroand amny others I can't think of! JUST BUY IT
2,I loved this book,"This is truly a wonderful book. I loved the dark/dead-pan comedy. It made me laugh, and it made me cry. I was sad when I finished it."
2,Hehehehehe,"I liked this book a lot, but I only gave it fout stars because there was that rather boring section about Chris's background in the center.It's still a must have if you like Demon Diary."
2,Love it! Perfectly fits one cube of butter too!,"This butter keepting is exactly what I was lookng for. It's nice and simply looking on the counter, fits one cube of butter perfectly, and so easy to clean. Just pop it in the dishwasher or hot water and soap. Perfect!! Thank you!!"
2,UNBELIEVABLE live!!,"I just saw them yesterday at Lollapalooza on the second stage, and was blown away by their performance. These guys not only know how to play and perform their songs and act, but just permeated energy the whole time they were on stage. I bought the cd there, and it is just as good as I hoped it would be. My review may be a little biased because whenever I listen to the cd i see them performing the songs in my head, but even if you havent had the pleasure of seeing them live, buy the cd if your a fan of rock'n'roll!"
2,Hammond B3 heaven!!!,"I just got this CD set!!! It is a live club date recording by the Alfred Lion, and it's smokin'!!!! Nearly 16 minutes up-tempo blowing on the tune ""Indiana"" only!!! This is true vintage Jimmy Smith from 1957!!! Small's Paradise's in Harlem, and there is a wonderful historical, cultural background on the club by Leonard Feathers that's worth the cost of the CDs. The music, of course, is priceless!!! If you are fan of the Hammond B3, buy this CD set!"
2,FUN EASY TO USE,BOUGHT THIS TO PLAY WITH THE ELDERS IN THE FAMILY TO SEE. NUMBERS ARE LARGE AND CLEARLY COLORED MUCH MORE ENJOYABLE THAN TRYING TO READ DOTS
2,Weekend Excursion Fan Wowed!,"This has to be my favourite WE album. Sam has a great voice & the music is poppy, yet keeps things rocking. These guys are as awesome in concert as in your CD player. Get up & dance!"
2,Great books,These books are great! They are a great mix of animal facts and aventure. There are six books in the gaurdians of Ga'hoole set. I got addicted right-away.

2,WinTV HVR-1600,"Pros:Very easy installation of hardware, I did have to go to site to get updated software that Windows 7 needed. Even with the software some of the QAM channels donot show up in win 7 Media Center, (you must manuely add QAM channels in WMC 7) but they do show up using the software that came with the card. No problems what so ever with ATSC, and analog cable signals. Great card.Cons: No free TV guide unless you use Windows Media Center, and schedule recoding is lacking.Recomendation: Would recomend"
2,Almost as enjoyable as the film!,If you havn't already go out and buy this soundtrack. It is phenominal! It showcases the original (and the best) Halloween theme by John Carpenter. The sub-themes from the original are also on the CD. These were almost as good as the official Halloween theme and are not fetured in the other Halloween tracks. Enjoy!
2,Wonderful Alternative to Access,"This program works well. It has a learning curve, although not nearly as steep as other databases. In addition, with versions 7 on up it is trivial to publish your databases to the web.I recommend the quikstart books for getting started with Filemaker. It has no useful documentaion for beginners to databases.It does however integrate beautifully with Excel and has very powerful reporting features. It also works perfectly in a cross platform (Mac and PC) environment."
2,if it was you,"This was my second Tegan and Sara album that I purchased. People often say that the album is worse than some of their other work, especially their album The Con. The first time that I listened to it I thought it was too different from their other work for me to enjoy it, but it is truly an amazing album and I would recommend it to anyone who is a Tegan and Sara fan or is new to their music."
2,AWESOME!,"I love Shania and I love this CD. EVERY song is my favorite. I have never been a fan of country...but, I love Shania Twain! AWESOME, simply AWESOME!"
2,Holy crap!!,"I picked this up out of curiousity. Well im amazingly surprised. Faster and more thrashy than Mnemic. Take Fear Factory, Meshuggah, Strapping Young Lad and a little metalcore and that is Dagoba. Guest vocals by Vortex of Dimmu and Borknagar fame on two songs helps too. A few acoustic passages but just sonic bombast of sound and chaos. Melody though, catchy riffs and thrashy riffs. Lots of stacato as well. Drumming is insane. Buy this. If you see it pick it up. Hopefully these guys will be around awhile. Sometimes the riffing and speed reminds of death or black metal. Great purchase."
2,Saving the best for last,"I purchased this album strictly for the final cut, ""He's Alive"". I heard Parton sing this song on an awards show several years ago and always considered it to be one of the top Christian-themed songs of modern times, and hearing it again only served to reinforce that memory. The other nine cuts are a pleasant collection of country tunes, featuring Parton's always-effervescent and sincere voice, but if you want inspiration, buy this album and listen to ""He's Alive"". You won't just listen once."
2,A SWEET Read,"OK, this reviewer had never read Charlie and the Chocolate Factory - never saw the movie with Gene Wilder, and even though am a Johnny Depp fan, never saw the newest movie -I dropped my defenses and got this book, and was I surprised! This is one of the most charming books I have ever read - a tale of love and respect of family and the moral that what goes around comes around -It is gentle, it is poignant, it is a must read for kids and us kids at heart -Simply charming."

2,The Perfect Companion if you live anywhere close!,"This wonderful book covers a lot of the word usages not included in a regular dictionary, that are peculiar to this area. If you can't find the word in your regular dictionary you will likely find it here."
2,Wonderfully well written book,I want to add my praise of a book that was so well written that I actually learned about football when I knew next to nothing about it. I viewed this part as secondary to the story of Michael Oher which was my main interest in buying this book. I had seen the movie and wanted more detail. What I got was a fantastic treatise on the history of football presented in such a gripping way that even I understood!! I am not sporty. Now I am really interested in seeing football as well as satisfied with learning about a family whose beliefs were so integrated into their lives that it did not need mentioning throughout the book. What a wonderful family. What a wonderful author. Thank you for this rare treat.The Blind Side [Blind Side](Later Printing Edition); Evolution of a Game

2,Fantastic!,"I was really questioning whether to continue after reading the gunslinger, but now I'm glad I did. I couldn't put this one down and I look forward to the third book. I have to be fair and say that some of the wording can be a bit confusing. It may be the effect he was going for with different people and different slang, but I found myself rereading a few paragraphs trying to understand if some things were typos or not."
2,Rosanne's Triumphant Return,"After having followed Rosanne Cash for 23 years, I can say that this is an amazing recording. She has been missed for far too long. From my first listen, I was amazed at how John Leventhal has recorded Rosanne's voice with a feeling that hasn't been felt before. The content of the songs are filled with fully felt emotions that are rare in music. And the songs from other writers fit in seamlessly with her own songs. Besides her father, the guest performers on the CD blend their voices into Rosanne's to great effect.A must have for any fan of singer-songwriters. And don't let an anti-country music bias prevent you from buying this. It's not a country CD -- it's adult music for adults."
2,As the rush comes-review,This is one of those moving songs that stays in your head and you do not get tired of.Motorcycle have done an excellent job at creating this song.As the rush comes is a soulful trance song which will pull at your heart.
2,Does that mean we got a video,When i was in early high school this stuff was al the rage. Everybody had a favourite character(mine was neil - maybe that why i still have long hair. Although its slightly dated now everynow and then i feel the need to re visit these. I love the bottom humour and the imagination that it took for some of these episodes. The music definately puts a date to the episodes but i love the part when Motorhead breaks through the wall and start singing killed by death.
2,ghostly and iridescent...,"I haven't actually listened to the album yet. But I've seen the film twice now. And the music (one orchestral theme and the chants in particular) is some of the saddest, loneliest music I've ever heard. The film itself is remarkable. As complex as ""2001"" and more haunting than anything I've ever seen in my life. And I've seen upwards of a thousand films. Movies are my life. And this one has captivated and challenged me more than any other. The score has only heightened its effect."
2,Good Wins Again,"The good vs evil story is told again and again, and this is just more of the same. However, in a culture where evil is misrepresented all to often as merely an alternative this film is refreshing. Evil is completely and obviously evil. On the other hand good is depicted in terms of charity, tolerance and love. Yet, it is also strong and the film depicts the good heroin as a capable leader. Freedom, and expression are championed, while evil is controlling, subduing, and brutal."
2,good old rubber spatulas,"I searched everywhere to find a kitchen spatula that was NOT the new stiff silicone kind, the ones that are absolutely useless when scraping a bowl. But - after much searching and phone calls - the Vermont Country Store actually called me back and said that while they were not in their catalogs, they did have them in stock. They are the best!"
2,Great for any Sega fan,This is a good sample of the classic sega games that anyone from the 90s can remember. I just wish it had space harrier.
2,Great value for the price,"Plug it in, connect to your computer or MP3 player, turn it on - decent quality sound comes out, and that was all I was looking for. It doesn't take up much room on the desktop, the cables are long enough to allow me to place all the components in convenient places, and the sound quality is good enough for me (at age 61, my hearing may not allow me to notice any sonic shortcomings).My only comment is the cheesy MP3 player ""holder"" on the control unit. It's not a real dock, it's a little platform that you can rest the player on, and there are little adapters that let you attach the player cable so the player can charge or sync while it's sitting on the platform. You'll need to plug the speakers into the player's headphone jack. At this price point, perhaps a real dock isn't possible."
2,Enjoyable!,"I'll buy any travelogue if it's written about Italy. This one did not disappoint. The author buys a Vespa off Ebay and travels through Italy, describing each city or town and its people and food. Never does the author come across as being ""uppity"" to Italians, but always as a down-to-earth man. Written with humor, it's never over-the-top. It's one of the most enjoyable travelogues I've read. I highly recommend!"
2,Where's 4 for plane trig?,"The only flaw in my copy is every fourth answer is missing (1,2,3,5,6,7,9,10,11,13, ect.) on every section. A very large editorial miss."
2,Great book,"This is an exceptional book about Game AI, hands down. I purchased this book to get a better idea of how to program game AI without the usage of massive switch statements and this is the holy grail. Every example he offers in the book is a real world, down to earth application of a game AI. It covers pathing graphics as well as Finite state machines, with a branch into Fuzzy state machines as well. I highly recommend this book. It also provides a good scripting reference and usage for LUA scripters. Great book, worth the price indeed."
2,The VERY BAD beginning,These kids are unlucky and with Count Olaf after their money which was left behind when their house burned down and killed their parents count olaf tries somthing horrible read it to see the outcome
2,"Great Composer, Great Book","I don't understand musical notation, but when Mr. Shawn goes into detail, his inspiration is transmitted to me, and I want to go hear the work.Schoenberg is tough, true. But I hope people will read this book and see he was human and passionate.It's really silly that I haven't had the opportunity to hear one of the greatest composer's music in concert. Will that change?With more advocates such as Mr. Shawn, I can hope so."
2,the_old_guy,"Disc 1 is wonderful... Gagnon's touch with these ""oldies"" is a pleasant, relaxing trip down memory lane. Disc 2 had a couple of tunes that were ""just ok"" but the real value is Disc 1... more than worth the price."
2,Very touching book,"I thought the story was very well written and it held my attention to the end. I laughed, cried and sighed though the entire book! Many of the struggles that Gayle went through, I experienced so I could relate. Some people felt there was too much ""drama"", but that is not true. The situations in this book are or have been real-life situations for some of us....."
2,"Hated to be enthralled by an evil-doer, but couldn't help it","It must have been therapeutic for Kent Walker to write this book. Most people in his position would not have been as strong as he.The thing I found the craziest in the book was the comparison of the photos of Sante in everyday life to her mug shots. I thought the picture on the cover of the book was Kenny and some other guy until the end.Very entertaining book that shows the value of family, and helps people see what factors lead to wrongdoing."
2,The EP soars.,"Well, to be totally honest to a fault, I liked a lot of these original recordings. Some of them more so than the re-worked versions on his debut. But really they're both pretty good.Track-By-Track Ratings:1. Back To You 4 stars. (this version is)2. No Such Thing 4.5 stars. (pleasant pop goodness)3. My Stupid Mouth 4.25 stars. (honest to a fault)4. Neon 4.5 stars. (one of His deepest tracks ever. Many girls are broken and searching for themselves, like this young lady is...)5. Victoria 4.25 stars. (calming & the beginning guitar riffs make this sound like an acoustic sound of Radiohead's ""Karma Police"". o_O Weird, but cool.)6. Love Soon 4.25 stars. (like the title)7. Comfortable 4 stars. (acoustic goodness)8. Quiet 4.5 stars. (liked this one for a while...)34.25/8 = 4.281254.28125 = 4.284.28 stars."
2,Really can't tell the diffrence,I've been using this filter on my C3000 ever since I bought the machine up until a few months ago. I really couldn't tell any difference in taste without the filter. I know it helps to reduce the buildup of minieral inside the machine but as far as taste my coffee/espresso it still tastes like coffee/espresoo without the filter. I would still recomend buying it to reduce the buildup of minerals inside your machine but as far as taste I would pass.
2,"Wonderful Gal, Wonderful Album","I love Sezen Aksu's traditional approach to the songs on this album, especially selection # 4, Keshin Bicak. This song alone makes the album worth owning, but don't worry, you won't have to fast forward through everything else. The other songs are a delightful mixed bag.This album was my first exposure to Turkish music and to Sezen Aksu. She deserves her title as the Diva of Turkey. My other big favorite is selection #7, O-kudum-da, as fun and rollicking as Keshin Bicak is sexy and sorrowful. ""Deliveren"" is a happy addition to my list of five-star reviews."
2,Insightful!,"Marketing consultants Don and Heidi Schultz present a plain-language deconstruction of branding jargon in this guide for executives who want to understand branding and build brands. The book's strength is its simplicity and clarity. At times, however, it reads like a series of articles that once were published separately, so that certain essential information is restated - often in virtually identical language. However, we find that the information in the book is valuable, as is the authors' thoughtful approach to branding. Their book merits a read by marketers and corporate decision makers."
2,"Good value, good replacement","Had a previous model for MANY years. This one seems just as good. Nicer fit in your hand, lots of tools, including lubricating oil (which I never used on the old one). Only complaint is that the adjustable head tool is a little hard to get on and off. But I would definitely recommend it."
2,Well Designed,This is awesome for a walk in the park and gives you full control over your dog who will be able to run as far as 23feet. Simply press the brake button and the leash stops. I recommend it. :)
2,Best All Temp Wax Around,"I first tried this wax last season and haven't found a reason to change it up since (other than using the Spring Solution throughout the spring and summer seasons at Mt. Hood). Not only does it help me fly past everyone else on the mountain, it also seems to last well. Although I tend to wax before each time I ride, I've also left this wax on for three day trips and I didn't have any issues (even on day 3).I'm also a fan of it being an all temperature wax as I know I'll get the same great performance no matter what the conditions are. I even had to start using it last August when I ran out of the Spring Solution and again, I wasn't at all disappointed in it's performance.I'd recommend this wax to any rider for great riding all year."
2,SUNCAST Do you hear me??????????????,"I really like the hose reeler. It is a bit hard to pull the hose out, but if you straighten it out, for me it's not a big deal. HOWEVER, I have been told not to deal with Suncast for any reason. The customer service is horrible. The charger doesn't work. I tried and tried and tried to order a new one online (I will pay for the darn thing) and can't. I need a quality control # which is not on the box or owners manual as stated. I cannot get ahold of anyone to help with this. Again, I've tried and tried and tried. I was told to call Amazon since I ordered it via them. They sent an email to you and your reply to them was you don't accept emails. NOW WHAT? I will glady pay for the defective part and regard this as a lesson learned the hard way. BOO HISS....."
2,Fantastic Concert,"Anyone whose ever seen the Bellamys Live knows they give 110% to the songs they sing. I saw these guys twice last year. Both concerts were outstanding. The musicianship was incredible and Howard and David's vocals were as good now, as when they began in 1976.The electric piano and steel guitar on ""If I Said You Had A Beautiful Body"" and this Live version of ""You Ain't Just Whistlin' Dixie"" are worth the price of the CD alone.""We Can Handle It"", and ""Goin' Sane"" aren't well known to most fans but are among the Bellamy's best songs. The verses to ""Let Your Love Flow"" aren't sung on the CD, but the guitar work makes you forget it.If you ever get the chance to the Bellamys in concert, get your tickets fast. This ""Live From Gilly's"" is worth every cent."
2,Short informative analysis of german armor in WWII.,What make this book stand out from other German armor books is Flesischer's concise analysis of the technical and operational use of German armor on a variety of war fronts (Spain & Russia). The majority of books I have read on this subject boast about the superior design and acomplishments of German armor. Flesischer's analysis debunks this myth. I've found out that all German tank designs were inferior to Allies designs in armor protection and gun callibre. The Germans were playing catch up in design inovation and mass production of tanks. Only superior German tactics and training overcame these short commings until the very end. The book is 80% pictures with 3 to 4 pages of great consise analysis per chapters (7). The picture are great in detail and should be interest to modelers.
2,Start and end here,"Anyone wishing to sample the Bhundu Boys needs to start and end here, because this 2cd set covers the period when the boys were hot in Zimbabwe and rivaled only by the veteran Four Brothers as masters of the jiti style. All the classics are here, including Faka Pressure, Simbimbino, Manhenga, Kuroja Chete, Hatisi Tose, Babamunini Francis. The Bhundu Boys were nothing if not versatile, their style dipping into Chimurenga, rumba and the slower rhythms favored by James Chimombe and Tuku. But the shimmering guitarwork remains a constant throughout. And the quality is remarkably polished."
2,Like it for my small car,"I like that it folds up into my bag, flew with it cross country in my carry on bag, and used it on my rental car and with rental bikes for a Florida adventure. Meanwhile, at home in California, I use it on my tiny subcompact car for local adventures with my mountain bike."
2,Best Book of the Decade!!,"The name says it all!!! This is THE Definitive Guide to Collecting Black Dolls. With gorgeous, color photos from cover to cover, it surpasses all expectations! I've never seen a book so lovely AND informative. It contains detailed information and wonderful photos of all types of Black dolls. I read the entire book the same day I received it. I could not put it down. It is obviously a true labor of love. There is NO other book that comes remotely close. I give it two thumbs up and rate it a 20 on a scale of 1 to 5!!!This is a MUST HAVE for every library. This long overdue and much anticipated book is not just for the collector, it is for everybody. If you buy only one book this decade, make it The Definitive Guide to Collecting Black Dolls. You will LOVE it!! Already, I am looking forward to Volumes 2, 3, 4, etc. Thank you, Debbie Garrett, for writing THE foremost resource about Black dolls!! Your book is awesome!!!!!"
2,PERFECT ENTERTAINMENT,"What more can you ask for, all the great stars with their movies plus the interviews with them, this has to be the best Trilogy release of all time stars like Fred Astaire, Ann Miller and Ann Sothern, I have sat and watched these dics several times already.Maybe I'm getting old but they never make great movies like this anymore, anyone thinking of buying this set if you do then you won't be dissapointed it's 5 star rated"
2,True Buddhism,"The Pali Canon is the definitive guide and words of the true Buddha. The teachings in this book go back 2600 years ago and are truly a masterpiece! If you are new to Buddhism then this book if wonderful to add to your collection. Even though there are many different schools of Buddhism...ie...zen, Tibetan.....this book has no certain way of being other then the true words of the Buddha. I would recommend this book to a learned sage as well as a beginner...."
2,Loving it~,"This is a wonderful CD, they get their point across with out being boy band-y. I really like it, a friend got mye hooked! Check them out!"
2,Great Booster,"I bought this to replace my son's high chair, it takes up no extra room at the table and my son is so proud to sit in it. Easy to clean and attach to the chair I would recommend this to anyone looking."
2,Great pseudo-live feel,"""Cliff"" is great. The album is recorded with a live audience, but the album has a studio feel to it. I thought it was a great concept. Every track is listenable. ""Cliff Sings"" is alright. The rockers on the album have a mellower feel, and I personally do not dig orchestration, so I am clearly not as big of a fan of this record. Great value for the money though."
2,Great Product..versatile,This blush has a different texture than most. Its not quite a powder nor a cream. Its somewhere in between. Goes on really nice and lasts. I have used it on both my cheeks and eyes. Makes a great eyeshadow and for the price its definitely worth a try. I think you will be happy you did.
2,"Sign Language Video Dictionary, Vol. 1","This video not only taught me basic signs, but also helped me to see how deaf people can help people who can hear to bridge the gap between them. I love when they help a nervous waitress to learn the signs for the foods on the menu, and she relaxes after she begins to sign on her own."
2,Center of the sun by Conjure one,"This was my first purchase on Amazon, and I really have to say that i probably will shop there again. Fast service, and they even added a written comment to a tiny scratch in the casing. This is the kind of service we all like. The scratch isn't so important when they offer an apology with the product...."
2,Great cream,"I use this at night, as well as a retinal, alternating nights. It has a light tingle when initially put on and works great for moisturizing and brightening the skin. I absolutely love this line of creams after trying several others over the past few years."
2,Great Book,This word sort book is an awesome resource that I use in my class during Word Study. I also have the other books in the series (each one focuses on different skills/grade levels.) This particular book is for K-1 readers. There are a pictures instead of words for the word sorts. I use this series in my classroom as a center activity and sometimes as an activity for the entire class.
2,Making Sense of Organizations,"This is an outstanding book for people who want to figure out what is really going on in the organizations in which they work. If you cannot make sense of things at work these days, read this book. It is an excellent book on organizational reality.This book should also be required reading for all ""managers."" If you are trying to ""run an organization,"" do yourself, and the people who work for you, a favor. Read this book!Finally, college and university professors should consider this book for their organizational behavior courses."
2,She went to war: The Rhonda Cornum Story,"I read this excellent, interesting book in one sitting. I was humbled and inspired by Rhonda's resilience and courage as she dealt with an enemy who does not fool around. I was delighted to discover the book I received had a signature on one of the front pages that looked like RhondaC.!CM"
2,a good Idea with some limitations,"After you're done with your introductory beer book and you've made a few batches, you may find that you want to brew something that reminds you of your favorite commercial beer.This is almost the book for you.The selection of recipes is heavily slanted toward beer that many homebrewers may find unexciting. But the authors have a very good point: by brewing imitations (maybe we should say tributes) of commercial beers, you learn how beer tastes are built. You get to refine your own sensibilities and taste. And you can't help but end up a better brewer.Lynn Hoffman, authorNew Short Course in Wine,The"
2,Fun to Sing Along With!,"Yes, I am one of those obnoxious friends who likes to sing along with the movie. And not only that, I've seen this one so many times, I can talk along with the dialogue, too! Yes, ladies and germs, this is Singin in the Rain! The fabulous movie that has brought you such unforgettable lines as:""Well, if it isn't Ethel Barrymore!"" (Gene Kelly to Debbie Reynolds as she jumps out of a cake)""Dignity, always dignity"" (Gene Kelly grossly misrepresenting his vaudeville career)""It's vulgar"" (Olga on talking pictures)""It makes us feel as though our hard work ain't been in vain fer nothin'."" (Jean Hagen as Lina Lamont offering her thanks to her adoring audience)Truly, I wish they had ""sing along with Singin' in the Rain"" shows at the theatres, like they do for Rocky Horror and The Sound of Music. I would sing along lustily and fall into the aisles during ""Make'Em Laugh"".An all-around wonderful picture."
2,Finally! A book you can understand!,"I actually found myself unable to put this book down - pretty good for a book on mental health! This book explains things in layman's terms and was very helpful and easy to understand. The many case histories, written in regular English, made understanding the concepts easy. One can definitely tell that Dr. Heller has an understanding for his patients, and is truly interested in helping them. I would recommend this book to anyone, whether you are frustrated yourself, or know an adult or child who is."
2,great little camera,love the ease of use of this camera and the stabilizer really helps the pictures come out clear....
2,THE BEST!,"I love this DVD! It has videos that aren't availible online like: Shoe box (which gets no respect), Lovers in a Dangerous Time, and What a Good Boy. It has live footage like: One Week, Pinch Me, and Brian Wilson. Oh, and a DVD ROM feature I've haven't tried yet, but will. The commentary is both very entertaining and very interesting. BNL talks about little-known facts about each video. I guess my fave video is Shoe box...of lieeeeeeeeees...yeah, sorry. I couldn't ask for anything better!"
2,Nice Tribute to Townes,"Really like this CD, great renditions of Townes music...would totally recommend it;I didnt give it a 5 star rating as I will always loves Townes Versions."
2,Homeschooling all the Way Through High School,"This was an absolutely wonderful book to read. I would definitely recommend it. The entire book was inspiring and had me ""all choked up"" on several occasions. The Mason childrens'contributions to the book made it all the more endearing. If your feeling a little frustrated with your homeschool, are fresh out of ideas, or just need a little ""pick me up"", this book is definitely for you! God Bless Renee Mason for listening to God and sharing her life with us!"
2,Bravissima Judi!,"Proof that Ms. Dench is one of our finest actresses today. An important set to own and cherish! And as ""icing to the cake"" her superb rendition of ""Send in the Clowns"" is included."
2,"I Believe in a Thing Called ""The Darkness!""","i may be a giant dork, but this album was pretty sweet according to me. I'm a fan of everything that's a little different, and the Darkness is different than all that STUPID, STUPID, STUPID, STUPID crap like f*cking clay aiken that's selling records today. i'm only 13 and i liked it! hey, it's funny, it's pretty rockable, the video for ""I Believe..."" is hillarious, and let's face it: anyone that says it sucks is just not looking past the first layer for the cool in the band. These are some of my other favorite bands so you have a reference point:David Bowie; Tenacious D; NIN; Primus; The Distillers; The Pillows; Mindless Self Indulgence; The Cure; Bjork; Rufus Wainwright"
2,So Glad To Finally Have It,I have watched this set over and over. I love it. Wonderful pictures and sound. I really enjoy being able to watch uncut episodes whenever I want. I also love the extras. Worth the wait and money!
2,Early starring role for Paul Newman,"In this early starring vehicle for Paul Newman, he plays an ambitious corporate climber who's forced to make life-changing decisions on his way to the top. Very effective look at life in the 50's and 60's, when bright young men on their way up (like my own father) were often forced to choose, and choose hard, between job and family.It's always worthwhile to watch Paul Newman, especially in a role that is a stretch for him. Seeing a professional at work is a welcome relief from many of the so-called ""stars"" of today. Not rated (mature subject matter)."
2,The rerelease of the Jerry Garcia Acoustic Band album,"This release was recorded in November 1987 at the Wiltern in Los Angeles and the Warfield in San Francisco. The line up consisted of many of Jerry's longtime Bluegrass buddies like former New Riders David Nelson, Sandy Rothman with JGB mainstay John Kahn on bass and drummer David Kemper on snare with new friend Kenny Kosek on fiddle. The album features many favorites such as Swing Low Sweet Chariot, Deep Elem Blues, I've Been All Around This World, I'm Troubled and so on. Most of the songs feature Jerry singing the lead although David Nelson does get a couple in there. The recording was made by John Cutler on a two track DAT feed and the reissue has been upgraded to HDCD. aside from that, I don't notice any difference in the sound between the new version and my original 1988 pressing bought by my grandmother for my birthday. She ended up liking this one too!"
2,Great Tunes,"Best songs from most albums, songs 1 thru 10 are my favorite. Listen to this album often !!!"
2,great,its great for begginers i havent really used it that much i have sewed a blanket and hem a pair of shorts but i havent had any problems with it. ive had one but it was totally my fault.
2,love it,"Absolutely love this helmet. Fits perfectly, and looks incredible. Very happy with the purchase, and will be back again. Thank you."
2,Think & Grow Rich,I enjoyed reading this book again after 30 years ago and the information jumped out at me and reminded me to work on myself to further pursue my success.
2,German Chocolate Cake in a cup,This coffee tastes just like German chocolate cake but not too sweet. The rich blend of milk chocolate and vanilla with a little bit of coconut tastes great! I would definitely buy this product again. It is one of the best I've tasted from Coffee Masters.
2,Thanks so Much!,"I got the books, and they are in great shape. The package came so quickly, and I couldn't be happier with my purchase. Thank you so much!!!!!!"
2,Good Trike,"It appears to be a fine trike. I purchased for my 18-month old son, and he absolutely loves his new ""car-car."" It seems to be a good fit, and I llike the way that he sits to the back instead of up high like a regular trike. I'm a little wary of it's durability (there is quite a bit of plastic in it, and I wish the tires were rubber -- not with just a rubber strip). Although, one of my 14-year-old son's friend's sat in it, and it didn't even squish down. EASY to assemble. I assembled it in about 10 or so minutes with the baby in it (he wouldn't get off). Instructions well organized and in English; hardware well organized. ... If it is truly durable, then I don't think you could get a better deal...."
2,Great product for the price,"We purchased this carrier to give us extra space for packing up our camping gear and it works great. Very easy to install (you must have the roof rack with crossbars already on your vehicle), took about 10 minutes total. It provides a lot of room, but truthfully, with a family of 5, and a ton of camping gear, we could have used 3 more feet! It does hold a lot of stuff though. For the price, a great bargain."
2,Sturdy and Attractive,I just installed some of these doorknobs in my house today. They are sturdy and attractive. It was very easy to reverse the knob to switch from left-hand to right-hand. You basically push a small tool into a hole to pop off the handles and then switch them.My only complaint is that they did not come with an optional square-corner face plates for the area around the latch and the strike plate. It comes with a rounded corner only.
2,it works like it should,"Don't waste your money on any of the expensive iPod speaker systems. I recommend purchasing any Y cable splitter and hooking up your iPod or CD player directly to your existing stereo system. Spend $10 instead of $200.As for this exact product, the Belkin Audio Y Cable Splitter 1-Mini Plug/2-RCA Plugs (6ft), I've had it for a month and am happy with it. No problems to report. Simply plug it into the an RCA cable input in the back of your stereo, stick the Mini Plug in your iPod, easy as that.Rock On!"
2,Money belt,Money belt keeps important documents & valuables close and secure. Would prefer a cotton in a lighter color.
2,Historically Impeccable Love Story,"What a book! For an author like Martin Cruz Smith who writes spy thrillers, this is an absolutely outstanding tour-de-force. Having come from a British mining family, I was flabbergasted at the amount of research that went into this book, and how well connected it was to the gripping plot. For those who don't like to have thrillers spoiled for them, don't read the ending and don't read the rest of the reviews after this one. For those who just enjoy good writing, even if they know the ending, ignore the squeaky wheels, savor this fascinating book, and buy a few copies for your friends for Christmas. You won't regret it.--K in the Blue Ridge"
2,It needs to be settled into.,"The difference between JV and other guitar heroes is that he does not up the intensity as time goes by; he finds his groove and works it forever. If you're a rave-up fan, it'll never come, but if you settle in with the band, you'll get more and more out of it as the set unfolds. Still, only four stars; JV's 'tight' style only goes so far."
2,Great product!,"Original item arrived broken but Amazon quickly picked up & refunded. I found same item locally since our camping trip was just a few days away. We had 8 adults and 9 kids all using this toilet. We did not use the bags but instead dug holes and sat the toilet above the hole, filling it in with dirt after use. This product feels flimsy but holds up wonderfully. We had adults as large as 300 pounds using this with no complaints."
2,Excellent but heady,"After reading references to this text in several other books on Scripture, I ordered a used edition for this book. While I am about half way through it, I would recommend it to anyone who is A) a Walter Bruggemann fan or B) a scripture scholar. It is difficult reading but he makes sense of a difficult-to-understand book of the Bible. It is definitely not bedtime reading!"
2,The DiCaprio Version,"My friends and I call this the DiCaprio version, and boy is it amazing! I think perhaps this movie is a 5 star or a 1 star - in other words, you either love it or you hate it. I definitely loved it!This movie steps away from the traditional ideas of Romeo and Juliet and delivers something completely new. Sure, seeing DiCaprio spouting Shakespeare takes a bit of getting used to, but once the original shock subsides the plot just takes over.The amazing thing is that Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes actually manage it. They pull it off! Romeo and Juliet cease to be the protagonists of an archaic, dusty, old romance and become real people with real love.One other thing, often overlooked: the music! Each song is perfect for each scene - adding just enough, never distracting and never taking away.Yes, the DiCaprio version is different, but that's exactly what Romeo and Juliet needed."
2,Peterson's life summary of Christianity,Peterson has taken a 35 year calling as a pastor and another 20 years as a professor and summarized it into a single short easy-to-read book about the impact of the Resurrection on the people involved. A dynamite practical book which I purchased for sons and friends. One of the best books I have ever read.
2,Worth the calorie savings!,"I tried this product because, as most people, I love peanut butter, but can't afford the calories associated with the ""real"" thing. I have only used the low sodium but this time around I plan on trying the regular type. The texture is nearly the same as full fat peanut butter and the taste, while a bit different, is quite acceptable. If you are a peanut butter ""snob"" this product probably won't suit you, but if you want the flavor and benefit of peanuts in your diet without the fat and calories, don't pass this up. I did try to make oatmeal no bake cookies with the product and they weren't qite a success. While the flavor was great, apparently there is too much liquid in this and the cookies didn't set properly. All in all, I love it and will continue to order!"
2,Wonderful movie,"A wonderful movie that translated the comic book well to the big screen. Doing what no other comic book themed movie has been able to do, these characters actually came across as ""real"". With the exception of Halle Berry as Storm (Angela Bassett would have been much better), each actor played their character perfect. Hugh Jackman will make you believe there is a Wolverine. Halle Berry, as usual, is good for looking at but not acting. Capt. Picard, I mean Patrick Stewart, is great as always. Don't let the fact that it's a comic book adaptation turn you off from seeing this movie. It'll definitely be your loss."
2,Great Read,"Took on the plane to Hawaii. It is a very typical Spencer novel, and that means it is worth the time and effort. We should all be as cool as Hawk."
2,Works as advertised...,"Good vacuum cleaner, extremely quiet but would have expected it to be more powerful. Good value at the reconditioned price but unsure if it's worth full price!"
2,Hard-to-find,It is wonderful and great to get products that work and I am so amazed of all the things that I can purchase through Amazon and have them shipped to my home.
2,History can be fun and instructive,"Whoa! I loved this book. I like Keegan's books, too. It's hard to say which is best. Tuchman describes a lot of personalites. Keegan has more relevant facts and explore strategies better. I read both auhors will equal fervor. I plan to read her ""Stillwell and the American Experience in China"".I've lent this book to several other non-history buffs and they can't get past page 50. Obvioulsy they will not be going to Amazon and entering a 1 star rating!You should love history before opening the book."
2,Really great CD,"Love this CD. It's very romantic and very relaxing at the same time. My favorite CD to listen to on my way home from a very stressful day at work. I never really liked ""Cold Cold Heart"" until I heard Norah's version."
2,Makes all other sneakers obsolete,"I've stopped buying other sneakers since discovering these, three pairs ago. These are exceptionally comfortable, well-padded without being mushy, very light, ventilated and stable. Even without the steel laces, these would be excellent running shoes. But it's the reliability and on-the-fly adjustability of the BOA lacing system that elevate these above all other shoes. In an instant you can dial the right level of support and tightness, and you never have to worry about laces coming untied. One caveat: If you run through the forest in these, it's possible for a fallen branch or some other debris to pop the BOA crank loose. Not a big deal."
2,Wonderful and enjoyable way to learn Spanish!,"I am a second year Spanish student. I love this book! I highly recommend this book for anyone learning Spanish or even if you already know Spanish and want to learn more about other countries. A great way to learn new vocabulary too. All languages need more books like this that are interesting (you actually want to read them) instead of the same old stuff that is in textbooks. They have done a remarkable job with this book. I think it is appropriate for beginners, second year, and third year students."
2,Achieves Its Purpose,"No, ""Nashville Skyline"" is not Dylan's best work. It's uncomplicated listening that--under 30 minutes--is little more than fluff. It is, however, instrumentally lively and lyrically solid. And that voice... Let's not even go there. Can anyone put a thumb on this man? The only problem I have is with that opening duet with Johnny Cash. This thing sounds like two drunks howling at the moon. It would have been better on ""Self Portrait."" But as a 'country album' and testament to Dylan's chameleon image, ""Nashville Skyline"" hits the mark."
2,good early grant,"cary shines and shows some innocence refined out in later work, plus a few great back flips! crisp dialog and charming story make it a winner."
2,Classic,I really enjoyed A Christmas Carol I have not and probably will not read the others soon.I really purchased to read along with The Mansion by Henry VanDyke as something to help boost my Christmas Spirit in December those along with Luke in the Bible the chapter dealing with the birth of Christ I think 2 or 3
2,Kitchen Aid stand mixer,"I'm enjoying my new Kitchen Aid Cobalt Blue mixer. I've been wantingone for many years. The mixer quality is like driving a fine automobile, feels and sounds like a Jaguar! What took me so long? Price! I'm gladI finally invested in such a worthwile product. Everything turns outlight, fluffy and fast..."
2,60 years old but still a gem,"This book celebrates its 60th birthday this year but it's difficult to top it for the most straightforward, comprehensive overview of the curriculum process. There are few curriculum writers or decision makers that don't follow the methods advocated by Tyler, in part if not in whole. The style is clear and easy to read, and furthermore, as one reads through, one realises that Tyler was advocating other developments like outcomes and standards years before they became (in)famous and incorporated in edu-speak. The best modern book on curriculum is by John Biggs (""Teaching for quality learning at university"") and he pays tribute to the influence of Tyler's book on his own work. Unfortunately Tyler's is one of those books that everyone has read ABOUT but few have actually read. Do read it - it has pearls of wisdoms for today's educationalists or for anyone interested in schools and what they do, and it is only 128 pages long!"
2,A great follow up!,Mr Williams follows his first book with more great insight into running a successful spa and engages us with story to make the points and hold our attention. This book provides information in a fun and informative way. Can't wait to see what he writes next!
2,ROCK!,"whoa. this album rocks so hard, i can hardly put it in words. but i'll try. first off, this album rocks. i covered that already. secondly, it rules. if all other rock albums were like royal subjects they'd vote this album king. then they'd bow down to it as it walked by. that's how much it rules. it's empire of rock is vast. thirdly, it doesn't even care who you are or who you may know. your mom's a school teacher? it doesn't care. it's going to rock you all the same. fourthly, the guitars in it are all like ""WEOWEOWWWWWWWWW"" and stuff. but i only gave it four stars because i can't understand the song titles."
2,GA go for downtempo mood,"Not what I expected especially since the album's title hints toward dance. The title should have been (Hello Lounge).GA has moved from its Jazz groove roots to more straight time downtempo music circa Kruder/Dorfmeister. It is a good album but a different direction from the sounds on ""Vertigo"". It will be a hard one to pull off live unless of course I'm sipping a martini on a velvet couch!"
2,Outstanding Live Disc!,"The Steve Howe and Steve Hackett short-lived supergroup ""GTR"" released one disc and this live King Biscuit Flower Hour performance in the summer of 1986.The former Yes and Genesis axeman perform along side lead vocalist Max Bacon, bass player Phil Spalding and drummer John Mover. The newly formed band play well together.They cover most of the tracks from their sole studio release ""GTR"", including the radio hit ""When the Heart Rules the Mind"". Hackett and Howe each take turns playing solo tracks from their solo work; Howe doing ""Pennants"" and Hackett doing ""Spectural Mornings"".They also cover songs from their former bands; Genesis' ""I Know What I Like"" and Yes' ""Roundabout"". Both well done as with all their guitar work on this CD.Although briefly together they left their mark with this disc."
2,This is a hot book.,The lovehate relationship between Faith and Gray caught meI couldn't put te book down. The mystery behind Gray's father'sdispearance was very intriguing. A very steamy book.
2,great album but......,"Green Day fans need a new album badly! i've been waiting since Green Day's 2000 release ""Warning"" to get some new material. Being a major fan of the band for a few years this is new stuff for me on ""shenanigans but not enough. The only new song on the record is ""Ha Ha Your Dead"", which to me is okay, it was nothing like ""Suffocate"" or "" Outsider"". Overall this album is good, but if your a recent fan, pick up your copy of: 1,039 Smoothed Out Slappy Hours, Kerplunk, International Superhits, and Shenanigans."
2,Slide soccer game,Franklin slide soccer game is great. we have so much fun playing and perfecting soccer steps. easy to use. great for soccer fans -it can entertain them for a while.
2,Fascinating Stuff!,"This book is so fascinating that I read it in one sitting. Not only is the information presented extremely interesting, the photos are absolutely beautiful. This book stayed with me long after I finished it. It's true that many musicians brought their fates upon themselves, but somehow tragedy still prevails. Victims of their own inflated egos? Environments? Perhaps. For those who could have prevented their own deaths, there is still tragedy in the futility of it all. Just because you're young and talented doesn't mean your life has to end in a fireball of legend. Life for the middle-aged is worth the trek. For those who died in plane accidents, our hearts go out to you.In the next edition, maybe the inclusion of Patsy Cline?"
2,lyrical Imagery -- the Jungle Enchants!,"This fascinating novel takes us right into the lives of the Harmston family and their home in the South American jungle. An intriguing array of characters unfold their personalities as we follow Cousin Gregory on his visit to this strange, lovable family. The jungle itself becomes real as the reader is immersed in the sounds, sights and smells of the bush, the plants, the animals and the river. And, of course, there are the shadows which move among them! Gregory, broken in spirit, seeks healing in this tropical retreat. We find that it permeates our spirit as well. A perfect read for a hot August weekend!The writing is so beautiful in its descriptions, taking the reader right into the jungle, that I sought and read other books by the same author. Unhappily, I failed to find any with such extraordinary lyrical power. I reread this one on a regular basis, usually in the heat of the summer."
