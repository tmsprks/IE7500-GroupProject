1,A Major Let Down,"While of course extremely amusing and full of hilarious situations, Rennison's fourth installment in the Georgia Nicolson series is old, overdone, and just plain boring. Sure, some points are funny, but the whole scenarios are exactly the same as they were in the other three books. Georgia obsesses over Robbie. Georgia antagonizes over her lingering feelings for Dave the Laugh. Yawn, yawn, yawn. Jas seems like a total Girl Scout (no offense to Girl Scouts or anything), and the rest of Georgia's friends are just lame. Like, please. Who actually does a disco dance and finds it FUNNY?!?!I have been looking forward to this one forever, but it's lost the charm. Ah, well, perhaps I've outgrown Georgia Nicolson and Mia Thermopolis...so sad. Not.Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to reread Bridget Jones's Diary and find some REAL humor."
1,i hate it,don't wast your money on this book. this book is sooooooooooooooooooooo dume and it give me a headack because not thing made cents. sooo don't get this book
1,Not good for my experimental use,"I had read many places that stainless steel bars could remove body odor the same way it eliminates garlic odor on your hands. I used this in the shower for about a week, and maybe I'm crazy, but I think my underarm smell got worse. I have not tried it in the kitchen (as that might be kind of gross after using it in my armpits), so I can't speak to its intended use. But if you want it for the shower, I do not recommend. The good news is this was the best price I found, so not a very risky experiment."
1,Potential Choking Hazard!,"Took out of package & was sooooo happy I never handed it to my son. I dipped it in warm sudsy water & rinsed it off...as I was rinsing it off a bug's wing broke right off into my hand without any force at all. I just ran my thumb over it softly.As I said, I'm glad that didn't end up in his mouth! FYI - it was the yellow wing off of the green bug."
1,Too Simple,"Zen in 10 is a very simplistic book. It gives a very light overview of what Zen is and it appears it's intended only as a primer. While it does give a brief history and philosophy of Zen, it seems its intent is to make sure it gives the reader Zen for aesthetic purposes rather than any serious discussion of this branch of Buddhism. I can't recommend any books on the subject since this was the first one I chose to read but I know that if you are serious about learning about Zen this is not the book."
1,Deplorable sentimental pap.,"A total waste of the talents of Patricia Clarkson and the others involved in this project. As a travelogue, it makes me want to visit Cairo - perhaps it was financed by the Egyptian government? I have been to Cairo, and it is nothing like this - this is the sugar-coated version, a little like the image of Tokyo one gets from Lost in Translation. Cairo is teeming with homeless, poverty-stricken people, as is all of Egypt. But all we see here are genteel sophisticates. The plot is predictable and emotionally detached - we never really care about these characters, only their clothes and their luggage seems to matter to the director. This is trash of the first order. Don't believe the hype. It's not worth $18.99."
1,Maddens Time Expired This Year,"I Know there will be some die-hard madden fans that will still buy this, but i think anyone with half a brain will be buying ESPN 2k5...better graphics, and they wanted it more (heh).....unless maddens price drops that is"
1,Communion wafer with grainy sugar. Yuck!,"I've been gluten free for about 10 years now and didn't have time to order my usual Schar Vanilla Sandwich Creams prior to a camping trip. These Kinnitoos were unattractive and crumbly which is no big deal but, to me, they tasted like thick communion wafers with thin, grainy icing. Sort of mealy and way to sweet. If you weren't crazy about these, you might try the Schar cookies. I like pretty everything from them."
1,bad color,"Pride and Prejudice is a wonderful story, and Colin Firth is great. The original was beautiful, but the color on this dvd is terrible. I sent it back."
1,UGGGGGHHH!!!!!,"This book is dumb. I mean dumb. This has got to be the most obvious Hollywood script ever disguised as a book. As a sequel to Jurassic Park, it stinks.I was going to give it a 1, but the story is mildly interesting, on its own, but when you think about DEAD Mr. Malcolm, etc., then it gets pretty dumb. Don't buy this book, unless you can get it for less that $1, and you need to take up space on your shelf."
1,It leaks!,"Do not buy this blender!! The jar leaks out the bottom. I got a replacement under warranty, and it worked for a few uses, now it's leaking again. Very poor quality, go with a brand beside KitchenAid."
1,Hand-Loom Weaving a Manual for School and Home,I thought there would be pictures to go along with the instructions . My mistake. The book was not rewarding for me so I never finished it
1,Weak...,"ick...this album is garbage. So many big names, yet so many weak tracks. The Pac/Biggie Freestyle is the dopest cut on the whole album. ""If I Get Locked Up"" by Eminem & Dr. Dre is a decent cut, if only for Em's lyrics, once you hear it a few times, it'll get old. ""True"" by Meth is a decent song, nothing spectacular. ""Dem Want War"" by Raekwon is one of my favorites, but it's too short. ""Ill Bomb"" is a dope cut, I don't like LL too much, but the beat is hot. I just named all the semi-good songs. Everything else is just pants. Skip this album, pick up Flex's Mixtapes, 1-3 if you don't have them."
1,AOD4 sucks sucks,"Haveing read numerous review, i decided to buy. After playing, i hate it. I get stuck in the campaign. Too boring i have to pratice over the same tutorial. There is no 1vs1 for beginner offline where i learn and have fun at the same time. sucks. No fun for beginners."
1,Komputerbay failed,"I ordered this item but it did not arrive as promised, so I contacted seller, and they told me to wait. I contacted the seller again and was told to wait until Thursday. I contacted the seller after Thursday and was told to wait after the next Thursday. I complained about that and they cancelled the order, so after all that effort I received nothing."
1,Didn't work on my Palm Z22,"I don't know if Palm changed the plug on the Z22 without changing the model number, but this charger did not fit my Palm Z22. Mine has a small, trapezoid-shaped port with the smallest base of the trapezoid being about .5 cm. The one I received was twice the width of the one I needed. There are no dimensions given in the product information, so I had nothing to go on to realize that this charger would not fit my Palm. I think I am going back to using paper and pencil to keep track of my addresses."
1,So So,"I have used items like this before. This is difficult to use on a Jaguar E-type, and the resolution did not seem quite right. For my purposes it wasn't much help."
1,This book should be called - I hate my children,Seriously? Seriously? Grow up and move on. Get a hobby. Find a good therapist. I only hope your children and the children of others aren't privy to this. The only people you hurt in divorce with nasty behavior like this is your children.
1,Weak expanding fences,Very flimsy expandable fence - wind took it down first day and wrecked part of it. We bought wooden two-by-four frame to put expandable part in to salvage some of the cost. The expandable fence price is not worth the wood it's made of.
1,don't waste your money,"This looked so good on tv, so easy to use, that I bought it thinking it would be easier on my arthritic hands. When I tried to use it, it smashed the tomatoes and absolutely would not work on a half of a vadaila onion. I had to cut the onions in inch thick sections to get it to work on onions. The only good thing about this item were the 3 lidded containers that came with it. I threw it in the trash."
1,"Placebo, possibly dangerous?","Was looking for a safe, non-medicinal headache relief for my pregnant wife, and stumbled across HeadOn. ""Don't know why, don't know how..."" piqued my interest, so I did a little digging:One of the active ingredients is a known carcinogen (potassium dichromate) which commonly causes contact dermatitis (strange for a product applied to the skin), and the company making HeadOn (Miralus) seems to have no basis for its claims of relief - it makes no hard claims about what the product does, instead relying heavily on testimonials (for which the company is of course not responsible) to describe and endorse the product.Search for ""HeadOn"" on Google (or your favorite search engine) and decide for yourself... I'll pass."
1,He needs a new road,"George hurrys out the same album every year. Same songs, different titles. Talk about a total lack of artistic creativity. He has become a misrepresentation of what a natural country musician is."
1,WARNING - won't play in your Mac/iTunes,"When inserted into a Macintosh computer, the computer thinks this hybrid SACD/CD is a blank DVD, and so you can't transfer it to iTunes. Big disappointment!"
1,Can't recommend this one,"Did not really care for this one. I don'teven remember is I finished watching thefilm to be honest. Seemed kind of ""cheezy"".Thumbs down."
1,Let down,"Lots of potential, wish it were cleaner. Start off well, then unnecessary scenes for higher rating I suppose. Rushed ending. Swear words and gay bar scenes do not make a movie better."
1,"I LOVE this story, HATE this version","This is one of my son's favorite stories. He smiles as we point out each animal and he always sits still through the entire book. I bought this copy as a gift for a friend's new baby along with several other favorite children's book. Maybe I should have been able to pick this up from the listing, but it is TINY. It is not the nice sized board book we know and love. It is a hardback with paper pages. There is no way we'd be able to read this one any time soon and I think the size would take away from the lovely pictures. Very disappointed!"
1,Didn't really like it,"This game is all about the scenery. The photos are beautiful but all you seem to do is walk, walk, walk. I should have known that I was doomed to disappointment when I saw the simplistic graphics on the opening screen. If you want to take a tour and learn all about Capri then by all means, buy the software. If you want an adventure game look elsewhere."
1,Lost time...,"The title of this film also happens to describe the feeling I got after watching it and then reading all the glowing reviews about it. There is some nice cinematography, a few insights about Japanese culture, and an out of character (but one-note) performance from Bill Murray. Otherwise this movie is a complete waste of time, with no plot to speak of, characters I couldn't care less about, and observations on life and stardom that have all been made a million times before. But then again, maybe something's been lost in translation..."
1,Mr. Big and Big Daddy,"Received the four plants, very small and unhealthy when arrived. I planted them and attempted to keep them alive. Unsuccessful, the plants died. I am not receiving much help from the supplier, for a replacement of plants and/or refund. I would not recommend this seller."
1,doesn't work,"These traps don't work at all. So, I bought a humane trap and caught my mouse the very next day. With the humane trap, there was no mess and the kids thought it was fun to see the mouse run away free in a nearby field."
1,Disappointed,"I have always enjoyed the 'Old' Star Trek series and there were some I enjoyed more than others. Having said that, I think it's a shame that the individual episodes are not being made available for download."
1,Not As Effective As Sugar Water,Save your money. Sugar and water (boiled) will work better than this mix. The red coloring doesn't seem to make any difference for attracting hummingbirds.
1,"Yes, Read the whole thing!","I don't see how you can isolate ""The Grand Inquisitor"" chapter from the novel in which it is situated, The Brothers Karamazov. I think that knowing who is telling the story, who he is telling the story too, what the story means to each of these people, and what the consequences of what the Grand Inquisitor have to say, are ALL important; important because it is a great novel and important in understanding the grand inquisitor!!!!!!! My suggestion: Buy The Brothers Karamazov instead of this. It's excellent."
1,missing article,"There are differences between internet edition and kindle edition. I read all articles yesterday, then I saw another journal, quoting an article in internet edition of NYTimes, I checked it out and the quoted article was in internet edition but it was not published in kindle edition. It hurts its reliability. I think I'll not continue my subscribtion after the free trial period."
1,Boring and predictable,"I was hoping for something new from this book, but... It seems that the books are getting SO predictable and SO much alike. I am sick of Vanza and sick of the same characters with different names. PLEASE give us something new!"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS JUNK!,"My son got this for christmas. It was difficult for even the adults to figure out. The pictures were VERY grainy and VERY difficult to download. My [...] son was so disappointed that he could not use it. We finally threw it in the garbage can where it belonged and got him a low cost REAL digital Sony for [...] Wish we would not have wasted the [...] on this. I should say, we did NOT expect great images from this camera, we just thought that he could easily take some low quality shots and put them on the computer. Even the adults got frustrated trying to figure it out. DO NOT BUY!!"
1,Japanese Goosebumps!,"This film is $7.50 at walmart! The Japanese Goosebumps! Twilight Zone wannabes! Yeah, it's good. Good to laugh at! The Sacrafice should have been packaged alone for $1.50; I would have been satisfied!"
1,South Horrific,"Wow Hollywood, what a great idea. Let's have Glenn Close, who looks no younger than 60, star as the young, naive nurse, Nellie Forbush, who was played delectably by Mitzi Gaynor in the original film. The cast just gets worse and worse - aw, geeze, what a piece of crap this TV remake was from beginning to end."
1,From a VCP who knows - Two Thumbs Down!,"Wow! This book is sad and is probably the worst self-published computer book I've purchased in years.I've been using VMware for 3 years and the content is really no different than what you will find on VMware's website, the VMTN community discussion forums, or in ESX Server documentation.Save your money and use the free resources. As a VCP myself, I am insulted at the recommendations other VCPs have made."
1,Poor quality,"This toy fell apart immediately when my dogs played it. They had the ""hee haw"" voice mechanism ripped out of the toy right away. I had to take it away from them so one of them wouldn't swallow it. The toy is not durable at all. I wouldn't recommend it."
1,Not 'The One' for me,"I love Jet Li-movies but this one sucks!!! Poor script,bad execution could not save the good premise of this film."
1,problems,"Even though they say oem Delco, I wonder.... After 1 year, engine began to miss. Replaced wires and brought new life to the smoothness. I have read of others having the same problem with these wires"
1,"Great title, but missed the mark","This book holds great promise in the title, however the author fails in two major areas. First, as he explains his therapeutic approach he makes reference to feeling magnetic fields from the subject's body. I highly doubt that this is possible for any human, but even if he is able to do this it is not reasonable to assume that this skill can be transferred. Second, he repeatedly recommends feeling the underlying tissues and bringing them into alignment. While this seems more plausible than feeling magnetic fields, it remains highly doubtful that anyone not doing this on a daily basis will ever develop the skill to feel tissue below several layers of skin, fat, and other connective tissue.My final complaint is that the writing style hangs heavily on technical jargon and repeatedly makes reference to techniques to be explained on other pages, which of course, never are satisfactorily addressed. And then there is the repulsive repetition...Just don't buy the book."
1,Dull and uninspired.,"The Last Good Chance is well written in terms of prose and form, but it is flawed in all other respects. Quite simply, the book is boring, dull, and uninspired. I literally fell asleep repeatedly while trying to get through this banal tale of rural New York."
1,Drivel,"Dave Matthews sucks, and so does anyone who listens to him. The only reason you trend following moronic fans like this drivel is because it is shoved down your throat by mainstream radio and Canadian beer commercials. Get a clue people. Go pick up a ""Yo La Tengo"" or ""Stereolab"" CD and find out what REAL music is like."
1,"product may be ok, but beware of Pro-Lab","not sure about the products, but if you need anything from Pro-Lab -- forget it. I had one test from them, when something happened I consulted them on the phone, followed their instruction, spent the money, and ended having 3 follow-up calls with them, each with different and contradictory information. Nobody know anything including the history of the issue. They ended up 'offering' me my money back but that never happened either.I will never do business with a company like that, especially if the health of my family is at stake."
1,Poor recording quality,"Even considering the low price, you should think twice before ordering this CD. The sound is muddy throughout, and distorted during the louder passages. There is no indication when this live recording was made, but it is well below the quality we've now come to expect."
1,Not what you expect,"I purchased this game because I believed it to be similar to Crash Team Racing and because I had read reviews that it was fun, addictive, etc. The graphics are great. I found the characters very hard to steer (you get light, medium and heavy characters to choose from)and I tried several. My dual shock controller was no help (I think I actually did better with the regular controller), which is odd for a game released in 2000. It needs work. I suggest to anyone considering this game - stick with Crash Team Racing - a lot more fun without as much frustration."
1,Another with disk 3 only,Sign me up as another that only received disk number 3. Waiting for my money back so I can stop elsewhere
1,Narrow disease perspective!,One will not find anything new in this book. If you are not a strong proponent of the disease concept then you will probably not like it.
1,disappointind,It doesn't spray with any force or if it is at any angle other than upright. You have to do two square inches of your body at a time.
1,No synch,I purchased this product for my Married daughter because Consumer Reports rated it #2 including ease of set up.Neither she nor her husband has been able to get it in synch with her cell phone.
1,Where's the piano?,"I remember when Lori Line played at Dayton's and was just getting her career started. She played beautifully. Line should stick with the type of music that made her popular. Her pop orchestra drowns her playing out, and all the other ""extras"" in this CD are too distracting. I can hardly hear her piano, which is the reason I buy her CDs. When I heard a portion of Three Dog Night's ""Joy to the World"" blended into the holiday version - what does this have to do with the Holiday - it was just too much.Save your money on this CD and spend it wisely on others, such as David Lanz, Jim Brickman, George Winston, etc."
1,Don't do it!,"As first use, the mouse seems great. But soon you will see that it makes the cursor on any word processing program jump around, especially email (Outlook Express). This causes typos that you don't know about until you spell check. the spell checker can't catch them all, especially syntax errors. Google the product and you'll see the same complaints. Might not sound like much but you will end up flushing it just to get this evil product out of your sight."
1,Disappointed in Hasbro,"I purchased the My Little Pony Celebration Castle for my daughter. After spending 45 minutes arguing with the castle to try and make it stay together we just set the piece that fall off in the hot air balloon that falls off the top of the castle. She has played with it once. I even emailed Hasbro with my concerns that for the money they wanted for this product it is poorly made. They had the nerve to send me a whopping $3 coupon. That is ridiculous. They charge parents $40 for a toy that if you breathe to hard near it, it falls apart. The crown is all disfigured from being squeezed into a small spot. And they expect children to be happy over their products. My daughter was so disappointed over this toy she hasn't touched it since. I would not suggest this toy to anyone who has a little child. It is a huge disappoinment."
1,wow...this is bad,"this has to be one of the worst tv shows i have seen in a long time - this guy is a journalist? he comes off as a pompous foreigner wearing khakis and a blue blazer who inserts the word 'dangerous' into every other sentence. he is trying to make the audience believe that he is some sort of thrill seeker journalist when in fact his insincerity and melodramatics make it seem all about him, not the story. i am sure that the situation on the ground in Somalia is dangerous but i felt like he was making too much of an effort to follow 'danger' instead of the real story. it was difficult to watch such horribly inept reporting and even as entertainment, this just does not hold up. to sum it up in one word: horrible."
1,"melodramatic, over-produced and corny","where is the edge??? the fist cd took the listener to places that the 2nd only tried to do. the third cd is a complete mess. If seal needs to get in touch with his ""sensitive side"" i suggest he find a therapist, work through a couple of issues and come back to the studio with a vengance. this cd is like vanilla ice cream...bland, bland bland!"
1,Paperback Hero,"This is not what the review says it is. I have ordered it twice thinking I was getting the Australian version, only to get a 1987 US movie.. I am not happy with the product."
1,Ummm...,"I should have played this game before I bought it. I definitely would not have purchased it. The board is too short...right when you start to maybe get into it the game ends. Unfortunately, the rules are so banal, you don't really want to play again. At least on the board. It's more fun just to use the cards and make up your own rules...which we did."
1,HAPPY DAZE,"I just received my season 2 DVD of Happy Days. I popped in the episode of ""Fish and the Fins"" waiting to go back to the years of watching this show as a 10 year old. I thought, ""here we go"", after seeing the record changer opening sequence. I couldn't wait to hear 'Rock Around the Clock', by Bill Haley and the Comets. Instead of nostalgia, I get a feeling of anger when I hear the third season theme!! What the heck?It's nice to watch the eps uncut, but I have to fast forward past the theme because I cannot stomach the revision.The first two seasons of Happy Days were pure gold. It really struck the balance of comedy and nostalgia. Until this DVD release, I never realized how big of an impact the music played in evoking that nostalgia. Thanks CBS and Paramount for your great care in preserving this classic show... not!!!"
1,Waste of a 3D movie,"Good movie!...reminds one of a Toy Story movie.Fun movie with a cute love story..If you like Elton John music,you'll love this movie,if not don't watch.All the music is Elton John.The 3D in this movie was forgotten!..This is the 1st 3D movie in which i didn't feel more involved...no wow factors,i checked to see if my glasses where on a couple of times,some parts in the grass look good,but thats it...The 2D is just as good as the 3D...I give the movie 4 stars and the 3D 2 stars.SEE ALL MY 3D REVIEWS:THANKS!"
1,Didn't Seem to Work for Me,My supply was low from the get go so I took recommendations from friends. This didn't seem to help me much at all and I ended up on a prescribed medication to help get things flowing. I have heard many good things from other people but it did not do the trick for me.
1,Just plain awful,"I had been a big fan of the Ya Yas and Rebecca Wells, so it was with much anticipation that I began this latest book. Unfortunately, like most sequels, it was a big disappointment. I could barely finish it. The story line was virtually non-existant; it lacked the humor and wit of the other books; and it was laden with too many random characters and child point-of-view narrations that drove me crazy. The bloom isn't even a bud, but some kind of droopy, dead stem that never quite had the gusto to live. Don't waste the money on this. I did and it definitely wasn't worth it at all."
1,Not Musical Theatre,"Like many people, I was drawn to Light in the Piazza by its amazing reviews. It was only after I had purchased tickets that I saw the performance on the Tonys. It didn't bode well. As a whole the c.d, much like the production, is over-dramatic, overly sensational. The music has been called ""lush,"" however I think it leans more to ""trying too hard."" It is all far too overdone. The music also lacks any sort of conflict or passion. All in all, a great disappointment."
1,Abysmal excuse of Stargate show,"This entire show is an absolute catastrophe. Boring, illogical, characters that no one cares about, and stories that are horrendous at best. To put a ""Stargate"" label on this garbage makes a mockery of the franchise. I am starting to see why SciFi, SyFy, Seifei, or whatever they are calling it today, is starting to drop in viewership faster than a lead balloon in a black hole. For God's sake, cancel this monstrosity already."
1,"Works OK, but too much head waste and label is expensive to buy","Not a good package: there is no way to reduce the head waste. You print out just a letter M, but you need 1.5inch of label: ridiculous! Also, you will have to pay $16+ for one box of label, which is only 3 meter long.Long-term use is very expensive!Buy the Brother one, you will pay the same dollars for one box of label, but it is 9 meter long. Also, it says it has less head waste. Let's see."
1,Blu-ray worthless,"The BD was indistinguishable from the standard DVD. If you own a Blu-ray player, just buy the 20th Anniversary Edition, which looks just as good and actually has some features on it. This version has nothing, unless you count the addition of Cantonese subtitles. Pretty sad."
1,"Cheap binding on hardcover, get Kingfisher instead","I bought this book in hardcover about 18 months ago. Two of my daughters used it regularly in their homeschooling for about a year. The front and back covers and spine are now completely detached. We did not handle this book roughly. It is a very large and heavy book which really needed a better binding.The content of the book has been useful. My older child has used it as a guide to find topics to read about in greater depth elsewhere. I had hoped that for the price, all three of my girls could have used the book. This book now serves as inspiration for me to study bookbinding.I bought the Kingfisher History Encyclopedia at the same time. It is a similarly sized book, was used with equal frequency in our home, and its binding is still in very good shape."
1,Don't Buy It Drips,"Drips continually until out of water. Not just an occasional drip but empty within 2-3 hours. Have attached it to the cage in many different ways and removed the little duck that floated inside, still doesn't help .. still drip drip drip.... When I read the other reviews I ordered anyway thinking ""I've never had that problem before these people must be doing something wrong."" Nope... it drips it drips it drips... I really have no idea how a company can put something so faulty on the market but *they did* stop dripping!"
1,This book was pure drivel.,"I read the comments of both the customers and critics and was excited when the book arived at my home. Then, after reading the book, I re-read the comments to see to see if they were perhaps talking about the same book I read. This was pure drivel. Read the back cover on the book...then multiply that drivel by 250 pages."
1,New product out of the box but doesn't work,"DVD player. After seting up all the connections and the menu, I pressed the button OPEN to insert the DVD and nothing happened. Obviously it's defective. I tried to get hold of APEX; they don't have any skeleton crew available on weekends by phone or E-mail. I guess I will have to return this thing and get another brand."
1,Uck,"I love Animorphs and have read up to #13 and Andilite Chronicals #3 (as of 12-4-97), but this one was my least favorite. Most the books start off by the character morphing, but in this book it started out with square dancing! There wasn't all that much of a plot, KAA must of been at the deadline to send this book in and had to write it real fast or something, because it was very short. Uck, I didn't like this one!"
1,Damaged goods delivered,UPS delivered a badly damaged box that contained the two chairs I ordered through Amazon. The box was not packed properly and the UPS delivery person had trouble carrying the unbalanced packing box. The box was not only damaged but also the two strapped boxes it contained were also floating around in the larger box. I opened one of the strapped boxes to find a product that was cracked and badly damaged. I could do nothing but return the product which is a tremendous pain. I returned both chairs for a refund.
1,Phone will not stay in receiver keeps falling out,I bought this phone as a backup when the electric was out. The problem is the phone when plugged in the wall jack it falls out of the receiver . The small hook to keep it in place does not hold it and we had to resort to duck tape to keep it in place. We have tried to adjust the plastic hook and if the phone gets bumped it still falls out. The plastic hook seems to move and it will not stay in one place. So if it is too far in the phone falls out or if it is too far out the phone will not sit in the receiver. And the worst part is we have realized that if it is not just right we cannot get incoming calls. The person calling hears a ring then a click then nothing. I know it was a cheap phone but now we need to look for something else.
1,MUVo MP3 noplayer,"This has been a big disappointment after all the good reviews I read before buying last year. It skips, blips off if touched while walking or jogging. I had the replacement cotract so took it back and got another one and does the same thing. I may have had only 2 workouts over the last year that it made it through without one of the above problems. If there was a 0 star, that's what I would give it. I would not recommend it to anyone."
1,did not work properly with battery !!,i have used it with battery video is clear but audio NOT CLEAR !! even 4 meters away !!
1,not pleased,"Sometimes you get what you pay for. I bought these because they werent very expensive. When i separate them from the package and try to use them, the ends curl up, making them hard to use."
1,Crossroads of Twilight,"A waste of time!! Wasn't this series originally supposed to end with the 10th book? There is no good reason to drag this out.Jordan has lost the respect and appeal he gained with the earlier books in the series.Guess I'll reread Glen Cook's Black Co. series again(best ending ever!) and hope George R.R. Martin finishes A Feast for Crows soon.Boy, did he ever raise the bar with the Fire & Ice series!! Better to do it his way and take more time and deliver something that satisfies than the tripe Jordan has turned out the past couple of books."
1,horrible wall suction,"This thing is horrible. Even though it did not cost much, it was a total waste of money. It is a piece of garbage and does not stick. Brand new piece of trash."
1,TERRIBLE,"The first Ghost Rider is good, this one is beyond terrible! I saw this movie in the Theater with my wife and son and we all had the same reaction. We all wanted to walk out! When the Ghost rider appears, he just stands there and looks stupid until he grabs a bad guy and just opens his mouth at him and growls or whatever he did. The directors said they wanted to see what happened to a skull when the set one on fire...it turned black so they went with that look,but Ghost Riders fire is mystical and doesn't burn his skull like real life! Even his motorcycle was sad. Don't even bother renting this garbage movie!"
1,Stop Kidding Yourselves,"Yeah, I know Wetton, Palmer, Howe, & even Thrall aren't coming back, but the line-ups Geoff Downes has put together are lousy. Ever look at their home page & wonder why they're playing in a bar & grill in some small town in Alaska or some other dump vice a pavilion, ampitheater or arena? BECAUSE THEY & THEIR MUSIC NOW STINK. Since the guys above left, so did the essence of Asia. The songs with Payne are lousy. The name of the band should be changed. The guys today aren't doing the name any justice. Just think if John, Paul, & George left the Beatles & Ringo recruited 3 other musicians. Stop giving 4 & 5 stars to albums after the above 4 guys split, got fired, whatever...."
1,It's barely ok,"I was really excited to find this book. My friend loves old aluminum Christmas trees and all things retro. I thought this book would be something she would really enjoy, and got it for her as a Christmas gift. It is a little on the small side. There are lots of pictures of aluminum trees, but none of them great or exciting...in fact, most of them are a little blurry and a bit dull. It would have been so much cooler if they would have made the effort to find REAL old photos and advertisements. There is not much written about the subject, either. So much could have been added to how and why aluminum trees came about, when and why they went out of style, their comeback today, their value in today's market, etc.. I wouldn't recommend the book at all. I took a chance on it, and I am still going to give it to my friend, but now I feel like I have to supplement this lame book with something else. I don't want her to be totally disappointed."
1,Not worth the price,"Look at the logitech USB headphones, which I've also reviewed: Logitech 980356-0403 Stereo USB Headset 250. I would reccommend that over this pair. This costs twice as much, and it's not even a true USB headset. It connnects through a USB codec. The sound is ok, but the microphone boom seems very fragile and inconvenient to raise and lower compared to the logitech. It doesn't get 1 star because it does its job, but if I had to buy another pair, I would buy the logitech again."
1,Where's the clock?,Have ordered two sonic boom alarm clocks and have been waiting since feb 1st...bought extension cord for what? Hope I have alarm sent soon. Do not order this product until you have used your alarm. Waste of money waiting on a back order!
1,Falls Apart,"The pegs attach to the pole with small screws that are too short. I tried reinforcing them with glue, but it didn't help. After less than a year, I had to replace this coat tree."
1,Dark Angel,A very disappointing read. It was the first Jeffery Archer I had read and almost did not read anymore of his books. Burma legacy helped reinstate him as an author.
1,What a waste of money,"We bought our first one of these in December 2009. It made really good coffee, quickly, and was easy to program. We loved it. But the pump died just six months later, in June.So we went back for another one, figuring maybe we'd just got a lemon. The new one lasted THREE DAYS. The clean cycle light is always on, but no matter how many times we run it, the danged thing won't make coffee. It's going back this weekend.I had a Braun that made good coffee for 8 years. Since then, I've had a Mr Coffee that lasted less than a year, and two of these Cuisinarts, lasting 6 months and a week respectively. I'd welcome any suggestions for a replacement.We can put a man on the moon. Why can't we make a decent coffeemaker?"
1,not a highly recommended cd,"Quite simply put...I bought the cd...I played the cd...I put the cd up for sale...no one will buy it.Overall I must say that this is a pretty bad tribute cd. I mean I give all the artists credit for trying, but that is about it. I personally liked only one of the tracks on the disc. Your taste may differ--but I urge anyone to listen to the sound samples before they buy. The music is less intense and much slower then the original songs. It sounds more like a club/techno/70's porno music cd. However, it is interesting to see how the different artists manipulate the songs, lyrics, and music. For any hard core Nine Inch Nails fan this is a piece to have in your collection, even though you may never want to listen to it!!"
1,Blew up my battery,"The package says all the right words, so I connected my new razr phone and what do you know -- it blew up my battery. Amazon should discontinue this item immediately. What a horrible piece of crap."
1,Sound track???,"Are any of these songs actually in the movie? I only heard the samples but none sound remotely familiar. I want ""Ponytails and Cocktails"". I think if you want the sound track for this movie, save your money because this is not it."
1,I didn't receive my order,I placed my order 2-2-10 and still have not received it. I am very upset about the whole experience.
1,Fell apart in washing machine,"My 5 year old just got this for a birthday present. She loved coloring it. I washed it per the toys directions (in pillowcase, warm water, within 48 hours, no dryer) but it ripped open in two spots while in the washing machine and most of the stuffing came out. It can't be repaired because it didn't even rip on the seams."
1,on broadway,"CAN I GIVE A ZERO RATING? THEY SENT THE WRONG ITEM AND WHEN I E-MAILED THEM, THE RESPONSE WAS THAT A MIX-UP HAD OCCURED AND THE ITEM I WANTED WAS SENT ELSEWHERE. SURELY THE ""ELSEWHERE"" WOULD HAVE NOTICED THEY DID NOT GET WHAT THEY ORDERED EITHER. THERE WAS NO OFFER TO FIND WHAT I WANTED, SIMPLY TO KEEP WHAT THEY SENT ME, WHICH WAS A NICE OFFER, BUT THIS WAS A CD I ALREADY OWNED."
1,Worst Upgrade Yet,"This is by far the worst upgrade yet. I bought the most recent 10.5.4 and installed it a few days ago on my G5. It installed fine, including the X-tools. After having almost 10 years of rock solid performance from OS9, Panther, and Tiger this has been nothing but a nightmare. My G5, now with Leopard, randomly and continually crashes with Safari, Mail, iPhoto,and as well as many other programs. Even the disk utility First Aid hangs the computer. In two days now it has crashed probably twenty times. The force quit will not terminate hung programs and the computer has to be restarted with the power button. I have Disk Warrior on order to try to fix things but right now I'm seriously considering deinstalling this crap and going back to the stable Tiger. Fortunately, I have a G4 with Tiger that runs, with the same software, without problems. After being an ardent Mac supporter for many years It is very disappointing to see Apple come out with software like this."
1,Functionally disappointing,"Although this feeder looks great, our hummingbirds didn't like it much, and refused to feed from it. To add insult to injury, two of the globes leaked."
1,Do not buy this device! You've been warned!,"I can only echo all of the terrible experiences listed here... I won't enumerate the entirety all of my frustrations with this POS, but suffice to say I'm furious about the hours and hours on hold with clueless tech support; spinning in circles with software that didn't work and didn't play nice with my computer; garbage print quality, ink that lasts 1/10th as long as they claim; clogged print heads; promises from tech support to get back to me with a fix...etc, etc.Without question this was the most infuriating consumer product I have ever purchased......and, for the money, aggravation, time, trouble, and anger they have caused me, I hope once-mighty Kodak goes the way of ENRON.D. YoungTallahassee"
1,Mr. Who? Certainly not COFFEE!,"We had high hopes for our new Mr. Coffee with the thermal carafe. The first pot we made was lukewarm at best and we were disappointed. That's when we noticed the instructions about pre-heating the carafe. Isn't heating supposed to be part of the function of the coffee maker? I really hated the filling guide on the front of the carafe, too. Very hard to see when the maker is full and all too often, the water is running all over the counter from a little hole in the back of the maker. I think Mr. Junk is posing as Mr. Coffee."
1,Sensational and salicious,"I threw the book in the trash after skimming it for about an hour. For some reason, the author believes that the Mormon faith played an integral role in Lori's murder...that if Mark Hacking were not a Mormon, he wouldn't have killed his wife (I wonder, if Mark had been a member of some other religion, would religion have even been mentioned in the book?). Major portions of the book are filled with lies and half-truths about the Mormon church used, I'm sure, to create an even more sensational story (the author himself, in the foreword, admits he gathered his information on the Mormon church from disaffected former members. So much for journalistic honesty). There was also the inclusion of very sacred ceremonies and symbols from the Mormon faith that served no purpose to the story whatever...except to create controversy. Sadly, I guess we all know controversy sells books, even poorly written books like this one."
1,Not for iPhone,"The sound quality is good WHEN it works. Although easy to pair with Blue Tooth to the iPhone once I did it and tried it again at the gym I can't get the music to play and of course you probably already know the controls on the Sony Headset don't control the iPod/iphone? I thought it was really cool at first but after trying to get it to work at the gym for three days running it goes back. It is also worth mentioning that you can't use regular rechargeable batteries. It has a built in Sony battery that you have to use its own specific charger for. Oh goodie, something else to recharge and keep up with. Not worth the headaches."
1,Damaged goods,"I was disappointed with this product because the two that I received, in which one was sent back, did not work. It may be the problem of the packaging company, I'm not sure but all I know is the product (both of them) did not work."
1,The Downloads are HORRABLE!!,"I got all the songs on this CD except ""Embryo"" and when i downloaded the MP3, it skipped & mistracked, then it also counted that i downloaded 2 copies of the track and everytime i asked for help there was always an issue of payment which i already done, they said they opened it up for downloading again but that never happened and when i tried to email them back its ""you cant respond to this email"" all i wanted was a tech support number or something but no i dont even get that. I oughta put just 1 star for lousy service!"
1,Finicky,"The strip worked with two of my electrical set-ups and did not work with two others. It didn't like my laptop as the main device or my Energy Star TV. For the laptop, I did followed the adjustment instructions and it seemed to be working fine, but then just stopped working properly. I move the strip to a set-up with our flat screen TV and it worked fine. For the Energy Star TV, when I adjusted it so it would turn everything off, I couldn't turn my TV back on again. Only worth the money if you love hours trouble shooting. I'm going back to using a regular power strip and just turning it off myself when I'm not using it."
1,A concordance it's not!,This would be a good choice if you are seeking a compact dictionary. I made the mistake of thinking it would be a concordance. It's not. John
1,Very mediocre Brazilian music,"If you don't know anything about Brazilian music they might fool you. They are trying to do something cool, but they fail in the attempt because of the poor harmonic structure of their songs. The rhythms are OK, in the sense that the percussionists know what they are playing, but overall it is not very good music. At the end the album is not even cool, it's very mediocre. In Brazil they wouldn't get gigs. Maybe because they are from Europe they got this record contract.On the positive side, there are a couple of OK tunes, that have been remixed and sound much better, like Banda do Ile, but in the album they don't shine that much. I am sorry Banda Favela, nice try! Maybe in the next one..."
1,Bad Medicine Stay Away,I make no judgement but highly suggest that you do not attend these gatherings.Happy to provide more information upon request.
1,They rust!,"TheyChicago Cutlery Landmark 12-Piece Knife Block Setall have gotten full of rust spots. I have old wood-handled chicago cutlery, which doesn't rust. I received the brand new set as a gift, but I'm disappointed that they are covered with rust since the first time through the dishwasher. The company doesn't care, I called and they told me to get barkeeper's friend to remove the rust, and to wash and dry them by hand. Really!!! My old set goes through the DW perfectly!"
1,Tried 4 times to get one that would not run hot.,"I had one of these a few years ago and it cooked very nicely. Recently I had the ceramic crack on me, so I purchased a new one. The replacement actually boiled water on the WARM setting. I returned it and got a second one. This one did not run quite so hot, but cooking on the LOW setting still had the water boiling vigorously. I returned it again and got a third one. This one still ran hot such that cooking on low was what I expected from the High setting. After returning it yet again and having the fourth one also run too hot, I have given up on this brand. Such a shame that their quality is now so poor. If you normally cook on the HIGH setting this would probably be OK. If you normally cook on Low look elsewhere."
1,Not Quite The Showdown I Expected,"I was really disappointed by this book. I agree with some of the other reviews that commented how this book was long on fiction but short on Christianity. I was surprised by how graphic this book turned out to be. The love of Christ can be shown in fiction without writing about such evil. Ted Dekker is one of my favorite fiction writers, but Showdown wasn't the book I had hoped it would be. Spiritual warfare is alive and real in 2006 throughout the world, but we're not going to learn how to fight in such battles from reading books like this one. Hopefully, we will be entertained by this book and not disgusted. I'm glad others have enjoyed this book."
1,Avoid this Kindle edition!,"OK, this review is for the Kindle edition - the book itself is a classic and a must-read introduction to calculus. (five stars)However, this and any other edition based upon the Project Gutenberg one should be strictly avoided: none of the mathematical symbols, graphs, and formulas are preserved in any useful way. The one Kindle edition that can be recommended ishttp://www.amazon.com/Calculus-Made-Easy-ebook/dp/B003XYEAOW/ref=tmm_kin_title_2?ie=UTF8&m;=AG56TWVU5XWC2&qid;=1285861412&sr;=1-1That edition, the one priced at $3.00, is a scan of the original book so it is not a typical Kindle book (i.e., you can't changes font size, etc.). However, it preserves the original formulas and graphs.By the way, it should be noted that none of the Kindle editions are the version annotated by Martin Gardner."
1,Among Cultures,"Perhaps I shouldn't be entering a review, because I never received this book. I ordered it about a month and four days ago, and nothing. Hm, I should probably look into getting my money back. Word of advice: Don't order books from the UK unless you actually live there."
1,Outdated ideas,The first edition was in 1973. The 2nd was in 2000. It reads like a 1973 hippie idea of marriage.
1,Pretty Bad,I don't see how people could give 5 stars review for this flick. The whole time I though I was watching a Disney movie the humor was really bad and played out. The movie got ... boring and predictable fast ...
1,Not for those who prefer more traditional mass,"Not recommended for those who prefer more traditional, reverent type of mass. It is for those who like the mass more as a social gathering, and not as holy sacrifice, and want their kids to think that way. The priest starts mass by saying loud 'Good morning everyone', then choir performs with guitars, and Sign of Peace where everyone tries to hand shake as many people as possible."
1,Terrible Movie,"Accidentally rented this instead of Clint Eastwoods ""Flags of Our Fathers"" and after 10 minutes in I realized there was something wrong because the acting was awful and it was like a low budget soap opera. Do not watch because this was such a waste of 10 minutes."
1,"Read the book ""Bumfuzzle"" if you really want to sail around the world.","This book is about feelings and emotions.Read the book ""Bumfuzzle"" if you really want to sail around the world and enjoy the experience.You'll want to cast off tomorrow."
1,WHAT!?,I really wanted to get this but when I finally was about to get it they raised the price. Now I can't afford it! 50 more bucks isn't a drop in the bucket! IRRITATED!!!
1,A significant portion of this book is in French.,"Just FYI, a fair amount of the dialogue in this book is in French. I quit reading it as I felt I was missing too much of the story."
1,DECENT!,I recently purchased this book as a way for me to better improve my Math SAT score. So far I am very pleased with this purchase. I hope to raise my Math SAT score by 200 points for the next SAT. Satisfied so far...
1,Rated R for scenes of graphic violence,"I was horrified to discover that my 10 year old daughter had found this book in the juvenile section (under 12) of our public library. She was halfway through the book when I realized what it was about. I am upset with myself that I have not been more diligent to look at what she is reading. While well-written, honest, and thought-provoking this book has graphic scenes of rape and murder that even many adults would find troubling. There are also several references that the US Gov't had trained, armed, and basically knew but did nothing about these genocides and of American citizens one quote is ""Most Americans don't know what their government does. Most don't want to know."" I do believe that as citizens of a free & priviledged country we have a responsibility to find out about and try to right wrongs - however not all Americans are this callous. I could say more, but will leave it at that."
1,What's Driving This Author? Jealousy!,"This book is an over-the-top attack on Rick Warren. It seems Warren's success, both in terms of earthly recognition and spiritual fruit, is too much for Sundquist. The arguments are overblown and not based on reason. It seems he was out to do a smear attack on Warren from the start, and his agenda drives the ""facts"" he uncovers.I am not Warren's #1 fan, but let me say this: If I ever have 1% of the effectiveness that Rick Warren has had for the kingdom of God, I will be thrilled. Let me also say that Rick Warren ""reverse tithes""--that is, he GIVES 90% of his income, and LIVES on 10%. And, once his ""Purpose Driven Life"" book became such a bestseller, Warren actually gave all the salary he'd earned in 20-plus years back to his church. That's an example I can't argue with. Leave Rick Warren alone and get your own purpose, Mr. Sundquist!"
1,Begins well... but later on... ehhh...,"Well, here's the thing. I liked this mouse when I first got it. After all, its optical, it feels nice on my hand, and controls well.But later on down the road...The track ball has gotten stuck. Don't know how, don't know why, but when scrolling, it gets to a point and STICKS. This is extremely frustrating when playing online video games where speed is essential.This, in itself, wouldn't be much of a problem if there was a way to open it and clean it. But... there's none. No screws, nothing that pops off... its just one solid unit.So, if you're looking for a temporary mouse, then this might be for you. But if you want one that will last more than 3 months... look elsewhere."
1,Piece of crap.,"All of a sudden my iPod would not turn on. I looked and I had it plugged into the charger, which had worked just fine for 3 days. I thought my iPod was broken since it is one of the original ones. I almost ditched my device but then decided to try and plug it into the computer ISB charger. My iPod worked! Turns out this piece of junk charger wasn't working so the battery drained on my iPod. The red light goes on so you THINK it is working but all it is doing is draining your battery. Spend a little extra and get a better quality one. It will save you money in the long run and time."
1,Deceptive sizing,"I should have trusted the reviews I read regarding the size of the tent. I ordered the 10x10 and it measured about a foot smaller. I work at a lot of festivals where I set up a tent for my business. My tent was surrounded by other 10x10 tents and you can see where my tent was way smaller than the other tents. And when you have several people in the tent with you, the smaller size is very noticeable. I owned a 10x10 tent previously with no problem. I feel ripped off by the deceptive sizing of this tent."
1,Great Social Commentary but Third Rate Musical,"""No For An Answer"" is a meager musical with a great 1930's leftist message. If you're looking for social protest, the recording is mildly interesting. If you're looking for musical theater, go somewhere else. Marc Blitzstein has written some rather majestic orchestral works, but the music is thin here and what's there is too often just a snippet. Disappointing as entertainment."
1,Maybe I'm too old?,"I love comics. LOVE THEM. In fact, there are very few that I don't enjoy. This was one of them. I bought the first three on the recommendation of a friend, and was pretty disappointed I did. Sure, it's cute, but not cute enough (if that makes any sense). I wanted more to happen, I wanted some more background information about Scott and the other characters, but it was so slightly (and glibly) written. Just telling me that everyone loves Scott and how great Scott is doesn't actually make him lovable. I liked the manga style of drawing, and the pace, but didn't find myself engaged with either the story or the characters.Perhaps if I were younger I would have liked this more. Although I've read other ""teen"" comics that were great, likeAmerican Born ChineseorLa Perdida. That said, I'd like to encourage adults who read comics to look elsewhere. For a teen comic, this one is kind of boring."
1,Wow. Dismal,"I really wanted to enjoy this, but it just hit me as poorly-written amateur garbage, without enough twist or humor to save itself. The lyrics are awkward and awful; the music occasionally tried to start something, but just didn't go anywhere. Trying too hard to be horrifying without enough substance to make it worthwhile.Burn it and bury it."
1,Ham-handed directing and a paper thin screenplay,"This a movie-length version of an average quality STNG episode. Frakes ham-handed directing really shows in scenes like the silly silo launch, and the ending where the Vulcan ship arrives and we have a picnic. Spielberg and Zemeckis have nothing to worry about from this hack.I was a big fan of the Star Trek TV series, but have always felt the movies were pure pap with plots slapped together to maximize box office receipts. First Contact continues in this tradition with a little something for everyone. Its like eating a meal of creamed beef, mashed potatoes, boiled okra, and vanilla cream pie. You're full when it's over, but it's hard to remember exactly what you ate."
1,Disappointing,"I read the reviews and had high expectations. I like Costas on TV, and had been led to expect a meaningfully insightful discussion. The book disappoints. The book revolves around only a handful of observations and a handful of remedial suggestions that even a modest baseball fan (like me) will find fairly obvious.Here's the book: Big market teams have a lot more money, so they have bigger payrolls, thus better players, so they tend to win all the time. This isn't good for the game, since poor teams will not survive and there'll be no one left for the rich teams to play. Some sort of revenue-sharing would even things out somewhat and, in the end, help everyone.Save your money."
1,Not for Plasma TVs,"Not a bad set for the price, but they should put in bold letters ""NOT FOR PLASMA TVs"". The infra-red ""noise"" from the Plasma TV screen interferes with the IR signal to the headphones, creating a buzz. No way around it."
1,Buy another DVD. ANYTHING would be better,"Complete and utter trash. But it provided me with an opportunity to see what a DVD does when you put it in the microwave!The acting is really pretty awful - almost something you would expect to find in a cheap porn film. The plot is flimsy, predictable and uninteresting and the filmography is very poor.I am no expert however on other people's likes and dislikes. I personally can stand a poorly made film if there is something about it that takes my interest. I struggled, but found nothing to redeem this offering. In fact - I have never seen it right through and that's a first for me.Sorry folks - I really cannot say that this one is worth the money!"
1,Pants,"This album is a disgrace to the word ""music"". How anything so abysmally poor can be released to buy for the general public, let alone be recorded, is mystery to any half musically educated person on the planet. How the public is brain-washed into spending 14 pounds on this is beyond me. My message to the people of the world is ""Buy proper music!!"""
1,challengedonlinebuyer,"This review has only a negative reflection on myself but I would like to make aware of my mistake. I ordered 2 books online and the one in question I received turned out to be a miniature copy which is about a 2 x 2 book and I was too devastated to even try returning and reordering so I have it as a cautious reminder as to why I am leery when buying online.Seven Habits of Highly Effective People, Miniature Edition"
1,blood on the snow,"This early Stirling novel displays many of the things about his writing that critics have found fault with: the extremely violent and sex-crazed heroine reappears in *Saber and Shadow* in a more positive light. This is a post-nuclear holocaust tale which is a part of the ""Fifth Millennium"" series which Stirling created with Shirley Meier and Karen Wehrstein.As with many of Stirling's novels, an extremely militaristic culture takes on peaceful craftspeople and, of course, wins. I have not seen the earlier version of this, and this is a review of the later revision.Stirling's fans will enjoy this; others might avoid it."
1,They took all the science out.,"This season of sliders was not as good as the first two seasons. They took all the science out of it and replaced it with ridiculous stories. With the exception of a very few episodes (Murder most foul, slide like an Egyptian, the guardian and double cross) it was a very disappointing season. I don't think that either the director or producers know where they were going in season 3, because they made the biggest foul up of them all by killing off the professor (the father figure of the group).Season 3 is not worth the effort. The stories are just too dumb down."
1,Not worth your time,"I first got the chocolate about 6 months ago, I didn't have trouble with it until recently.My first lasted me about 5 months, and it just turned itself off, and wouldn't return on. It would just show the verizon wireless page, and then turn off, then on, then off. It had an internal malfunction in the hard drive, and wasn't my fault. I am very good with my phones mind you.My second now is freezing, and not turning on unless it's charging, which only happened once, but still.Someone I know who also has the phone is now going onto her fifth chocolate, you read that correctly FIFTH.LG needs to figure things out with their phones before they mass produce them, because this type of malfunctioning behavior is unacceptable for the price we pay for these phones.If you are going to get this phone, please reconsider. I would also be cautious about the newer model of the chocolate. I have been so infuriated with this phone, and the lack of care put into it's development."
1,****WARNING****,"Hirt's should have known better. They should know better than to send live nematodes through the USPS. They should have known better than to send it with a TINY cold pack during a heat wave. They should have known better than to send microscopic organisms that were doomed to die by their negligence and stupidity to a biologist, who can easily confirm that the organisms died. I will NEVER buy from Hirt's again. They charge high prices, they overcharge for shipping, and they are incompetent. They don't even know what nematodes are, referring to them as ""insects,"" which they are NOT.*update*To their credit, Hirt's did refund my money. I still will not buy from them due to their gross incompetence, overpriced products, slow shipping, and the fact that I will have to order this again from another company, putting me a week behind in stopping the life cycle of a few garden pests."
1,Not like comic violence,"The special effects of the movie were fine, but I'm afraid that I've become weary of the constant violence. It was one thing when it was in the comic books, but IMHO, the realism portrayed in movies is not good: to wit, the murders at its opening in Colorado."
1,Try Generous John's Gospel and Galatians to become a less unfinished Christian,"A catchall dumpster lacking its lid;A clueless crossword without a grid.Religious reveries so rotten,After encountered best forgotten."
1,Save your money - buy Flying Dutch,"Save your time and money - this book was a disappointment. I have always enjoyed the Holt books I have read - but Little People was a complete waste of time and money. An interesting idea, that is poorly executed; boring and tedious. Why, when there are so many good Holt books, was this the only one on the shelves of my local Border's."
1,Should have sent back,"The bag it self is of good quality. The zipper and location are horrible,you have to feel around and guess where the opening us on the top for the hanger to come out, if the zipper went up to the top it would be much easier to use. All I can say is it is very difficult to use."
1,Ghost radio,"I Bought this item for my son for christmas almost 2 yrs ago. After many nights of me complaining about his alarm going off at all hours of the night,and telling him to read the directions so he can set it correctly. I have found that there is a ghost in his unit. I have checked his alarm settings for both of the alarms and they appear to be ok. His alarm went off from 11:30pm until 1:30 am last night when we finally unplugged it. Now that I have done some research it appears we are not the only ones with the ghost in there unit.If you do not have a problem being up all night due to the alarm picking and choosing what time it wants to go off then this is the unit for you.I personally would not recommend this item to anyone. I doubt I will purchase any other RCA items as I should have learned from the last items purchased they are no good.A disappointed customer"
1,WASTE OF MONEY AND S&H CHARGE,"Absolutely misleading description! You turn the game on and CANNOT SEE ANYTHING! I thought i got a broken unit, went to Target got another one, returned the one I had and the new one was the same! Different buttons don't function properly on different units, on the first one the DEAL button would not respond. The second one pretty much as soon as I turned on and saw no light on the so-called LCD screen I new the hand-held game is a waste. And what a hassel to return to Amazon! Besides DON'T BUY THIS GAME, DON'T ORDER ON AMAZON. I got another game Tetris and that one just came broken, still trying to return it. IT'S A ""NO DEAL"" ON THE DEAL!"
1,Thought it would work for my short haired cat...,"One of our (many cats) has difficult to comb fur; his fur is too short to use a bristle brush, too silky to use a comb or pin brush (slips right through). Thought a curry brush would be the answer because a curry brush for our short haired, no undercoat dog, worked so well. Alas, it does not work at all. The pins are too close which seems to work against picking up the hair. And it's nearly impossible to clean the hair out if you do manage to pick up some hair. And kitty HATED the rubber brush, but that of course is just my psycho cat."
1,a little too country,this wasn't really what i expected. i bought it for 'paper wings' and was really disappointed that the rest of the cd didn't seem to follow that same style of music
1,"Will not rip into MP3's, no credits or lyrics","I was in a hurry when I ordered this and did not see the note about this not being the original product. We actually have the original 1989 product but had misplaced the disc, so I thought we'd just get another copy. When my wife tried to rip this into MP3 format for her portable player it generated a lot of errors and that's when we dicovered we had been sold something other than the original product.I'm disappointed that Amazon is selling this type of product, that resembles what most of us would have called a bootleg CD a few years ago, even if Sony has given them permission to do so. When you buy a CD you expect the lyrics, credits, recording information, and artwork. Others online vendors still list the original issue, UPC code 0746442282, ""Columbia 44228""."
1,Bait and Switch Supplier,"Abacus 24/7 did not ship the product they were advertising. The splitter is described as gold plated and pictured with the two outputs in a block configuration. What they shipped was a cheap knockoff, nothing resembling the splitter pictured. I expressed my dissatisfaction to the supplier's customer service who felt the appropriate solution to their rip-off was giving a 68 cent refund. I have since ordered this same item from another supplier and received exactly the splitter that was listed. This is an excellent item when received from an honest supplier. No more of my business for Abacus 24/7. Be aware of not only what you buy but where you buy it."
1,An absolute mess...both musically & lyrically,"This could have been so much better. When I heard the first single I was thrilled. However the album is a completely different story. Gwen said that this is her 80s tribute dance album. Well, she sure did a tribute to the 80s dance scene. In this disc she pays homage to every uninspired 80s dance tune out there. It's a disc full of those ""other"" songs on an album that you never listen to. Despite the talented producers they seem to contribute only their worst stuff. I wanted to like it, really I did but even after repeated listens I still shake my head in disappointment."
1,Biased book!,"A major historical work ?! I bought this book hoping for a new look at Jesse James to supplement Ted Yeatman's classic biography. The errors are extensive ! Many readers wouldn't recognize them, but someone who has read some of the true books on the border war and Jesse James will immediately notice them and be quickly revolted. If this author did his research, he left the notes at the library. By the way Stiles is a revesionist historian. He is a lier, omit facts and twist the truth to fit his lie!This is well the worst book about Jesse James I've read."
1,Lousy Product,"The hard drive went bad on this beast. I called their customer service to get some action taken to repair, tons of run-around, no solutions. HP/Compaq refuses to fix the problems. We've got family photos and movies trapped on the drive. Word of caution to always remember to back up files to a secondary drive or dvd's. Especially if you buy this computer!!"
1,A Poor attempt to bring these two worlds together at best!,"I am a fan of both the X-men and Star Trek, but I must admit I am very disappointed in this book. About half way through I contemplated about not finishing it, but it was a short book and I kept telling myself it would get better. Sadly however, it did not. I found the X-men characters poorly portrayed, and did not care at all for the romance between Storm and Picard. In addition, I believe several of the characters actions, both X-men and Starfleet, to be out of character and inaccurate according to their respective story lines. Finally, I must say I was expecting a little more depth to the story line as I found it very predictable and free of any twists. About the only good things I could say about the book would have to be the camaraderie between Worf and Wolverine, and the fact that the nook was in fact short!"
1,Tech review,The clarity was not so good. Mp3 version issues exists (only few version supported) The slide show mode is not playing music.
1,"Distant, Unlikeable Characters In Predator","I used to eagerly wait for the next Kay Scapetta mystery. No longer. Predator is a mean-spirited story populated with unlikeable, distant characters. The magic of earlier books inthis series is gone."
1,The Abridged Aeneid,"I knew before buying the abridged audio book that i would not be completely satisfied. The story jumped around without warning, and the book ended without closure. After listening to the discs twice now i can say that I did not understand much. In addition, the parts I did understand i thought were copied directly out of the Iliad. I purchased the actual book and started to read it, because i refuse to believe that the famous Virgil i heard so much about could write what i heard."
1,Piece of Junk,"Bought this unit in February of 2008. Out of the box the FM never worked but we decided to live with it as the picture and TV were okay. Now there is a terrible buzz in the speaker after the unit has been turned on for about an hour. No warranty left.Loses presets if the power even dips for an instance. They included round head screws for under the counter mounting. Terrible quality, no thought at all for installation and poor warranty. Never buy any thing from Audiovox.Audiovox VE927 9-Inch LCD Drop-Down TV with Built-In DVD Player and Clock Radio"
1,Wrong Size,This pan is advertised as 3 inches but is actually only 2 and 3 fourths inch high. I already had a pan this height. This pan is to be used for cheesecakes and I needed the extra quarter inch.
1,RESEARCH ON THE MAIN THEMES,"Iam looking for help to study the main themes (death, African influence,..) of The Cattle Killing. please help me."
1,Oh my goodness!!!!,"I just read Fern Michael's The Marriage Game. Golly! I have never been bombarded with such an unbelievable plot, poor writing, and forced romance EVER. Insult to injury? I bought this....EEEK! I just gave it to my co-worker so she can give me a second set of thumbs down for this number. Fern, her editor, and the publisher must have been deluded..."
1,Poor design-- plastic neck broke with light duty,"We have very light duty for this-- use it every other week for 10 min max. Unfortunately, it did not last more than 18 months before it design flaw was exposed: an all-plastic neck juncture that just cracked.Avoid this one!"
1,A Great Disappointment,"I too was forced to read this book for an AP English course. In fact, the only reason I finished reading the book was because it was required reading. Except for a few interesting stories and facts (emphasis on FEW), the book is incredibly boring. I live in an area similar to where the book is set, and I still found it uninteresting. A book only for hippies, environmentalists, and people looking to ""find themselves"". Save your money. There are a lot better books out there."
1,Grade School.,"Given the talent involved with this flick it's truly a shame how utterly bland OLD SCHOOL is. A superb cast is wasted on jokes that are unfunny and/or poorly executed. There are a dwarfs handfull of humerous scenes and they do not make up for the banality of the rest of the package. Do yourself a favor and watch ANIMAL HOUSE for the sixty-third time because I guarantee it will produce more laughs than this snoozer. Poor writing and direction drags a comedy dream cast to the Deans office, a damn shame."
1,All the deep emotion and refined sensibility of Liberace,"... and that's an insult to Liberace, whose maudlin treacle was at least technically competent. _Bridges_ is a stupendous failure on every conceivable level and probably some inconceivable ones. Its only redeeming value is its unintentional hilarity; otherwise, it's a sugar-frosted turd."
1,Lost power less than a year,"Is there a less than 1 star. After 5month, it just stopped working, How do i get my money back. Not worth it for the money. I have a smaller tv that I have had for 6 years and still works."
1,Wish I had read the reviews first!,"Now having scanned the reviews here, I wish I had read them before getting this book. This book is rambling...and I really, really mean rambling. It's like talking with a neighbor and hearing his opinion. In this case, having read about 200 pages worth of his opinions, this is a neighbor you would have tuned out after the first 15 minutes. What's Your Number? I don't freakin' have one man! I am trying to figure out how to make the most out of what I have and enjoy life more. This book didn't provide a lick of useful advice for that."
1,Not for me,"I guess I just can't jump onto the raw food bandwagon and actually, I have no reason to as I'm healthy. I read Carol Alt's awful book and then this one. This one is a little better than Alt's, so I gave it 2 stars, but frankly, I do not believe that fasting for what, 2 weeks, is good. Especially not for kids and definitely not for anyone who participates in athletics--I find it really hard to believe that her son could participate in marathons while fasting.It's just a little too much meditating and philosophizing on the wonders of the human body for me in this book and other raw food books. I'll stick to my fruit, salads and cooked potatoes & bread with my meat as a side dish."
1,"How about a revision, Mr. Lakein?","I found this book to be very outdated, especially in reference to women. The modern household and the roles of women in the workplace have changed dramatically in the decades since Lakein wrote this book. The men in my class LOVED the book, but we women found it to be irrelevant and, quite frankly, patronizing to women. To follow his extensive steps consistently in prioritizing life's responsibilities would take more time than actually DOING those things. Ladies, there has to be a better, more timely volume of advice out there for us on this subject. Mr. Lakein, I believe it's time for a revision."
1,Poor shipping performance,While the table itself is nice however it arrived in a box that looked like it had been in a train wreck. Table itself has a couple of minor dents. I'd certainly not buy from this company again.
1,embarassing,"I did not have great expectations upon watching this movie, but i did think that even if it was another predicatable ""chickflick"" it would still be fun to watch and make you feel good like most of that genre.This one just did not deliver in any way. The acting was so bad, i felt continously embarassed for Orlando Bloom...from his first narrative. I love Kirsten Dunst but she was stuck in a bad script so there was not much hope there. As for the plot itself, i did not become engrossed at all with the story and did not care if i saw the end or not.I could tell what i was supposed to be feeling in some of the scenes but i felt no emotion except embarassment.The movie apeared good; all the actors fit the part physically, the scenery was pretty, and the music was a great background. but it just did not do anything for me.Overall i would recommmend watching Almost Famous instead, that had a great soundtrack with a great movie."
1,Don't waste your money on this book!,"Don't bother to buy this book. David Adler merely collectsfacts about the life of Abraham Lincoln and connects them together. Alist of facts do not a story make! Lincoln was a fascinating man, with a sense of humor and a strong will and an honest character who seems to have truly cared for others. None of this comes out in Adler's books. Not even listed as facts in his boring way. I gave the book one star because the artist shouldn't be punished for illustrating the wrong book. But the people in the pictures are barely identifiable. Buy another biography, like Abraham Lincoln, which won a Caldicot award and has been around for decades. I doubt Adler's book will last that long."
1,Disappointment,"The order did not get to me within the range it was supposed to be to me. Once I recieved the product it was not even the correct product I ordered. It had no Blackberry anything on it...that was my whole purpose of getting this case. The leather case I received was very plastic looking and the swivel clip was not removeable, nor does it move easily. It is a struggle for me to even twist the clip."
1,You would have to be sick to enjoy this book,"It portrayed Karla as a helpless saint and transcribed the videotapes. I know what happened and can't imagine what the families must have thought, knowing this was done.He probably enjoyed watching them too."
1,Successful Franchising,Still have not received the book and have been waiting weeks.Where is it Amazon & how long do I have to wait before it arrives?
1,Danger Danger Danger,"This product should not be used for any type of work involving chemicals. These wooden test tube clamps snap easily into themselves leaving the test tube swirling through the air and consequently crashing on the table or floor. They are very poorly manufactured. I wonder whether people have already been seriously insured by a test tube filled with hot acid when this clamp catapulted it through the air. Definitely a possibility for a serious lawsuit here. If you have these contraptions, just pick up a test tube and shake it slightly. Of course, do not try this at home and only when the test tube is empty. - I found a use for these wooden clamps. They work well enough to hang up socks on a clothesline. But for this purpose you may be able to find much cheaper alternatives."
1,Hard to put on,"Fits my Glock 30 like a glove, But the snap on feature is very hard to apply to your belt with one hand. I wanted a easy on/off holster for my Glock 30, and the MX7 has bad reviews so I thought this would work. The snaps have to be lined under the belt, another snap over the belt and snap together, to hard to do while holster is loaded or unloaded. Back on the hunt I go!!!"
1,Fail!,The very introduction to the book is a perfect analogy of the exact opposite of the author's intention.The author describes his giddiness prior to an interview then pretends to be asking hard hitting questions. And finally he looses all credibility when he assists with breaking down his own question.This is clearly a commissioned work where the conclusion was reached prior to any interviews.Only theologians were interviews. No opposing points of view.Fail. Epic Fail!
1,Too many problems...,"I've owned this unit for almost a year. I have two major problems with it. First, DVD's start skipping, sticking, jumping, after about an hour of play. I'm talking pre-recorded movies, not home made stuff. I pull the CD out and play it in my 5 year old TV/VCR/DVD combo unit in the bedroom, (from Walmart), and the DVD plays just fine. I've used the standard DVD cleaners to see if that was the problem...nothing. Secondly, the remote control unit is horrible. The buttons are very small and I have to be, literally, 7-8 feet from the unit, standing up, and pointing it exactly at the unit to get it to work. I've changed the batteries many times just in case that was the problem. Basically, it's a worthless clunker of a unit. I'm shopping for a replacement today. I see that this unit has several nice reviews, but I cannot echo those sentimeents. Caveat emptor!"
1,A shade of what they used to be,"I'm really disappointed with my recent purchase. I just opened the bag to take out some silver and it's tarnished. Really a disappointment. I don't know if the bag was made in China as others have said, but I do know the product didn't work. I should return it. Very reluctant to buy more until they change manufacturers."
1,One doesn't return a gift...,"This book was a gift from a friend who thought I'd like it. And I appreciated the thought. In a way, I did like it. There were heart-wrenching moments and a nifty ending, but I just can't stand wading through the endlessness of the never-ending present-tense. Even in real life one does not live in the present tense. To me, this literary device, posing as great literature, is becoming all too common among gay writers. I'll be glad when writing an entire story in present tense is old hat and goes away."
1,Terrible!,"This product was advertised as having a metal grater. However, when I received the product, I found that the grater was actually made of plastic, which made grinding very difficult and even more trouble than it was worth. At times, I felt as though I was using my entire body weight to grind simple foods, such as rice and noodles - even after blending them in my food processor first! In the end, I sent it back. I would highly recommend all interested to avoid this product entirely!"
1,"Great idea, but needs work","We have two of these bath product dispensers and both have trouble dispensing conditioner. We primed it, according to directions, but conditioners that are thick don't work for long. In order to get enough conditioner to use, one has to push the pump about 40 times. We've emptied the chambers, soaked them for a while, cleaned out the holes that the conditioner comes through, but it still does not work properly. The other products (thinner ones like shampoo and liquid shower soap) work fine. I would have returned the product, but it stopped working a while after I'd thrown out the receipt. I think that there is an area, still clogged with conditioner that is impossible to reach and clean.Edited 10/7/2007 - I followed the directions on the product's web site to clean the nozzles, but the one that held conditioner still does not work. I'll probably order a new nozzle and report back to see if that solved the problem."
1,ROBO COP SUX 80 PERCENT,"This game has nothing to do with Robots and Cops. Besides, Robots and Cops do not mix. Plus, if it's a game, then it's a bad game. I hate getting taken by cops and I hate kiddish robot toys. And this is a flawy game."
1,Did NOT Work!,"My 8 month old Brittany frequently spends time at my parent's house. They live in a wooded area and when she's out there she runs around and gets a LOT of ticks. We purchased Frontline Plus hoping it would work. Well, it did NOT at all. We put it on her and after about a week, still no difference in the amount of ticks attached to her. Everyday, we were picking ticks off of her that were attached and feeding. What a waste of money. We are going to switch to a flea/tick collar. I'm hoping it works for her."
1,Gets Mt. Ararat wrong,"Halley uses 17,000 ft. high Mt. Ararat in eastern Turkey as Noah's Ark's final resting place when the Bible says mountains of ararat in the book of Genesis. Also, old traditions attribute the Ararat range to a different area than where Mt. Ararat (formerly Mt. Masis) is located.On other points he talks about humankind seemingly only 6,000 years old (as most Biblical versions claim if generations are taken literally in Genesis). Well, like another book written in the early 1960's (The Genesis Flood) this book is out of date badly on the age of humankind as DNA studies have since totally proven human life is much older than the few thousand years these books claim. Unlike the Genesis Flood this book seems to reflect the author's real genuine beliefs."
1,Awful historical fiction!,"The book is written in the first person, the narrator being a teenaged maid. Apart from the fact thtthte style is unconvincing (no teenager I know could think like this), the plot resembles a Victorian softcore s and m romance more than it does life in the 17th Ct. Netherlands. What is particualrly odd is that we're supposed to like the narrator, a thoroughly ungenerous, judgmental, superior, witholding, and smug character who is basically a Daddy's girl. She is happy to criticize the other women in the household in order to get Vermeer's attention, as if she were saying, ""Daddy, daddy, I can clean better than they can. Paint me (Guess what else) me too!"" The novel tells us next to nothing about Vermeer, his painting, or the process of painting them. Nor does it tell us anything about being a model. If you want to read good historical fiction, look elsewhere."
1,"Skips a lot, and consumes the batteries fast...","I had previously used a Rio Volt, that also had the same problems, and I had returned it. Then I saw this one at a very attractive price. But no, it isn't worth wasting your time on it. You should rather buy the next higher model, EXP 301/303. This model EXP 201/203 comes without belt clip, the Electronic Skip Protection is very delicate in beginning of each and every song, it cannot read directory structure if you created it with DirectCD, the batteries last only 8 to 10 hours rather than 15 as claimed by Philips on internet. After using it for a month, and getting very annoyed at the end, I returned it! (But don't dispair -- I bought the EXP 301/303 model and I am very glad about it. None of the problems I listed above exist in the newer model. I will buy a couple more for my family members.)"
1,Don't waste your money!,"Would not hold a charge and stalled out after about 10-15 seconds. This was the FIRST time that I used it after it charged over night. This is the second one that we purchased, the first one wouldn't even power up. It is USELESS and a total waste of money."
1,royal disappointment,"My 4 year old got this on his birthday in July. Already bored with it. First of all we found that if 2 children leaned on the same side, it tipped over. This was the most fun for my son. Other than that, he grew tired of it VERY quickly. It constantly needs to be reinflated as it tends to lose air quickly. One of the swords has had a leak in it since day 1. I consider it a waste of money. On the other hand my 2 year old nephew loves it. I would not recommend it for over 3 years of age."
1,"EXPECT TO GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR, AND NOTHING MORE.","The scissor is very stiff, because the blades rub against each other. Which makes it a little difficult to use. But what can you expect for $3? The best thing that I can say for it. Is that it is better than nothing. I am spending more to get a decent replacement."
1,Good intentions,"The Office is a mockumentary surrounding a group of typical office workers, where their workday consists of ego clashes, inappropriate behavior, and tedium. What worked so well in the BBC program fails to translate in the American version. The awkward silences, the confessionals, and the naturalism seem artificial. Unfortunately the majority of the actors seem overly in on the joke and preoccupied with trying to recreate what made the British version flow so well, causing the show to feel unnatural and forced. The subtle blink-and-you-miss-um jokes feel all too unsubtle and sometimes over the top. The only actor who manages to rise above this and slam dunk all of the jokes is Steve Carell, the star of the show. Somehow I feel the American version of ""The Office"" is worthy of a laugh-track, and that's never a good thing."
1,Cheap and it doesn't fit my tub,It definately is cheap plastic and it doesn't fit over my tub. Waste of money.
1,Mrs. Long,I bought this product for my son for Christmas and 2 days after Christmas it quit working altogether. I am so frustrated. For 30 bucks this thing should work better
1,One word to describe this movie - Horrible,"This movie is not worth watching. It's not scary, it has a dumb story line, and poor characters. The only good part was the look of the ghosts themselves. If someone took the ghosts in this movie and put them to another script, it would be much better. Lastly, the acting [stinks]! Rent, if you really want to see it -- buy, if you or a relative acted in this movie... because it might be the last one you/they are in."
1,"""Universal"" docking station did not work w/ my computer","I bought this docking station after doing some basic research. When the installation failed, I went to the manufacturer's website to download updated drivers. The new drivers gave an error message that this model did not work with 64 bit Windows 7. I contacted the seller and I was told that it was my fault for assuming that it would work with my system. I looked the docking station up by the model number, which I first found out from the driver disk included with the docking station, and I found out that the model that would work with 64 bit Windows 7 had a model number one digit from the one I received. The only advertised difference between the models was the model I received had a standard video port and the other one had a DVI port. In the future I will follow the advise of the seller and assume that nothing they sell will work with my computer. I will never purchase from this seller again"
1,"Love The Style And Feel, But Didn't Last","We have had this Kohler Forte faucet for about 2 years. I really love the looks of it and the way it feels in my hand when I pull out the sprayer to use it. The single handle is easy to use and to control the water temp, and generally I am very happy with it.Except - after about a year the swivel function froze up like other reviewers have mentioned. You could still turn it from side to side but it was a major effort. DH called Kohler and they sent him some free parts, which of course didn't fix anything. We held off on buying a new faucet because we wanted to remodel the kitchen and wanted to wait to make sure the new faucet matched the rest of the kitchen. Luckily the pullout works fine, because it was often easier to pull that out than to try to swivel the faucet.We are in the remodeling process now and I am shopping for a new faucet. I will NOT be buying this one again even though I love the form and function - I just don't trust it to last very long."
1,Spotty photo performance,"This printer works well sometimes if you use the costly Durabrite paper. Its nozzles clog frequently and Epson's drivers for Mac OS X are horrible. If you're patient enough and are willing to go through lots of supplies, this printer is capable of making good prints. However, next time, I will look for a more reliable and consistent printer from a company with better Mac support."
1,it was ok,"I, like many of the other reviewers, am a great fan of pride and prejudice. I have read the book like 5 times and watched the A&E movie at least 10 times. I adore the characters, plot, the whole novel. I read this book and well the I did noticed inconsistencies and the flaws. I was upset that she killed off Mr. Bennet, from whom it was obvisious where Lizzy got her wit. Yet, I did have a hard time putting it down. It does not do JA's characters justice. However, as a stand alone book it is not ""god awful"", it has its good points. However, by no means will it ever do pride and prejudice justice as a sequel."
1,I liked it bc it was about Mariah but could have been better,"I read this book for two reasons. One, I love Mariah Carey, and two becasue I had a book report due for a Rock 'n' Roll class. I did not like the begining of the book at all. It focused too much on her mother. It also did not say much of anything about her life in school, which really upset me. There were two points in which the author misspelled her name! I was so shocked I almost put the book down! The pictures were all old and none of them were in color. And after all the fuss about her mother there should have been a picture of her in there!!! I wouldn't recomend the book to a Mariah lover but maybe to someone who has just heard of Mariah. Over all the book was a flop! Sorry, Mariah!"
1,Boring!!!!,Though this book would be really good considering the reviews. Must say it was sooooo BORING! Don't get it. The whole thing is a big disapointment.
1,Smooth jazz ain't jazz.,"If you're thinking about buying this album because you heard him play with Ornette Coleman, DON'T --> I truly cannot understand how anyone who played with a true musical genious at the calliber of Coleman (and sounded pretty damn good, by the way) could sink so low. I bought this album (not from Amazon.com or I'd have heard the clips) and I was shocked. Despite the despite the stupid cover, I expected good music. If you want to hear a great JAZZ guitar player, check out Pat Metheney, 'cause if you think this is jazz, or even music (muzak more aptly) than maybe you'd better take another shot of morphine."
1,Disappointed,"I'm sorry, but I was truly disappointed in Mr Fenton'stranslation of the Bible. He brought up some good points, butwhat got me right away was his pulling out the word for ""image""in Genesis and making it ""shadow"" which really makes no sense.I still think the best translation is the KJV with a StrongsConcordance. And there is one called ""The Companion Bible""that is the KJV with a wide margin explaining the verse usingthe meaning of the words of the old Hebrew,Aramaic and Greeklanguages, which you can find in the Strongs Concordance. Thereis also something called the ""Interlinear Bible"" by J.P.Green,Sr. It is a set that gives you the English translation and theHebrew and Greek with numbers over the words that are codedwith the Strongs Concordance which makes it so much easier touse and understand.If you could add these books to your stock I would behappy to highly recommend them.Thank you for your time,Barbara"
1,Misogyny lives in Nabokov's Lolita,"Interestingly, the reviewers who boast that Lolita is ""The best novel I have ever read,"" are all male. Lolita is not about love--pedophilia never is and Lolita is 12 years old. As a professor of English and as a feminist (and the mother of a young girl), I have never been able to ignore the troubling content nor the blatent misogyny in this text to appreciate Nabokov's clever narrative structure. If men think this is a love story, then, goddess help us all."
1,Great Neck Bit Brace = Chinese Jink,"This bit brace was total junk. The ratchet worked poorly when I got it. When I put a 5/8"" auger bit in it, the entire chuck blew up within 5 minutes (6"" deep into the pole I was drilling). 2 of the 4 jaw teeth came out, and the square bore at the base that the auger drill bit fits into to transfer torque was completely ruined and rounded out. Ended up finishing the job with a pair of solid Craftsman Vice Grips. This is cheap Chinese junk - I think the red handles are a sign of the maker. I would rate it ZERO stars, but you must have at least one. Don't bu y this - you will be disappointed."
1,Not whats pictured,The pic shows the old round top can which i wanted because the new can doesn't smell the same.Highly disappointed please sell what you advertise!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Lasts less than a YEAR...,This initially was a great product and I loved it for many months. After 6 months the screen on the unit began to malfunction and there was no image coming thru. I replaced the handheld. In less than a year the screen did the same thing plus the screen stopped working altogether. I have two friends who also have the monitor and they have also had problems with the screen. The company will only replace it within a year of purchase. (why only within a year...becasue it will stop working after a while).I find there are so many other models out there and hopefully one that will last thru more than a baby's first year.I Do not recommend it at all.
1,sound quality is awful remastering makes sounds unnatural,i think murray perahia is a good pianist but this recording and remastering makes the performance intolerable to hearsounds like a pianoforte and in the bathroomvery unnatural compared to concert stagei would recommend new recordings made at 1980s and 1990splaying style is like gulda but gulda is better talented
1,Not worth watching,"This movie is HORRIBLE!! I got bored out of my mind after 10 minutes of the movie. Enough said. "":("
1,Live to Win,"Live to Win being Stanley's 2nd solo album and 2006 release has here created an ok hard rock album with good vocals and quite well-written lyrics. The first track ""Live to Win"" is a good track. Unfortunately the rest sounds like standard light hard rock music and gets a bit tedious after a while. Allmusic gave the album 2.5/5. All the lyrics are included in the booklet and for each track we get a list of whom plays what. 2/5."
1,"12"" French Skillet Disappointment","My wife and I bought several open stock Circulon pans as we read reviews that were favorable. At first we really liked this pan, however after a few month's use, we began to notice that it was becoming very difficult to clean. The high-low cooking area was no longer very non-stick and the ""lows"" or grooves were very difficult to get clean. We tried brushes and scouring pads but the longer we used this pan, the more difficult it was to clean. We spent nearly $100.00 on this pan, but we rarely use it any longer because it has become so difficult to clean. For light use I suppose it would be a good pan, but don't use it every day."
1,Pretentious Garbage,"I bought this DVD based on extremely inaccurate reviews on this website. I just wished I would have seen it before deciding to own it.I condone avant garde, experimental, or artistic films. But this movie is absolutely worthless. Uninteresting, plotless, and vainly attempting to be intellectual, i'm embarassed this DVD sits on my shelf. I can think of no reason to own this movie except to be able to say you like a movie that no one has seen before."
1,So loud it went straight in the attic,"This toy turned out to be so noisy that I never gave it to my child. It went straight in the attic. Frankly I was concerned it could damage my 10 month old daughter's hearing.It says that it is for children of all ages, well certainly not for babies and toddlers who have their toys up close (even licking them) all the time. Perhaps when she is 3-4 years old, but certainly not now.Why on earth did the manufacturer not put a simple little button on it to control the volume? I think this could have been a great toy, but as it is now it's useless."
1,Not 100% cotton or proper BDUs,"These are decent pant but if you're in the market for 100% cotton ripstop BDUs, these are not what you're looking for. If you're looking for Cotton/Poly blend you can generally get a better deal elsewhere.Description states: cotton which is misleading. Should read cotton/poly. I don't believe these are milspec. The other milspec BDUs I have all had button fly - these are zippered.These are made in China and the stitching is sloppy. Of course, that's not directly related to being made in China. Comparing to Propper brand BDUs these just don't compare.I suggest these instead:Olive Cotton Ripstop BDU PantsPropper also makes a poly/cotton blend which is more durable but less comfy than the all cotton and cheaper than these.I am returning mine."
1,So Unlike Alexandre Dumas!,"This is a terrible book. Having read many of Dumas' other books, I expected a story about a dashing young hero who would fight with the blood thirsty rabble in Paris to rescue the innocent victims of the revolution. Instead, I found an aimless and unbelievable plot that proceeded to kill off all the heros and heroines in the book. I was left totally perplexed about why Dumas bothered to write this awful book."
1,"Yes, They Are Bad","I just wanted to add to the negativity of those who have written before and perhaps save some poor soul the aggro of buying and attempting to use Sony CD-R's. In a word, they stink. I purchased several spindles, and they have been uniformly bad, with many bad discs in each spindle. Avoid them. A better alternative are the Memorex CD-R's which contain only one or two bad discs per spindle. Be kind to yourself and don't buy this brand until Sony makes some attempt at quality control."
1,Can your heart stand the shocking facts about grave robbers from outer space?,"This is the soundtrack to ""The Worst Film of All Time"". The CD features the audio track to the entire movie on one disc. Music, dialogue, sound effects, etc. Yes, the sound to the whole darn movie. And it's all on one 70 minute track, which is very annoying. You can't skip ahead to various scenes if you want to. Aside from that, why would you want to just listen to the movie on your CD player, when you could watch it on your TV? It loses a great deal of it's effect without the visual aspect."
1,Too small for an adult head,"I was looking for a round thin brush for travel. Unfortunately, this is not it.It is much too small and cumbersome to use on the average head of hair. It would workgreat on a doll, just not on an adult head. A positive is that it has high quality bristles."
1,Waste of money!,This product does not work at all! I have displayed the Lure in my back yard for a whole week and not one drop of Wolf Urine has appeared. What a ripoff!
1,Worst movie ever!,"This has been the worst movie ever, look at what the characters are eating in the movie. BEACON. What is bacon made of? PIG. One of the major rule of islam is never to digest anything with pig ingredits, if this movie was a comedy then WTF are the producers doing by dissing a major religin.Another aslpect of the movie was the idea of the screwed up family, the time frame isn't right for one thing if the first kid dropped the engagement then the whole family would have been thrown out of the community and shamed to harshly that would be looked on as a lowlife. There would be no way to set the second and the third wedding. This movie was a major turn off and a waste of time."
1,Too Scary Kitty,"I wish I had seen all of the reviews for this, before I purchased this video from Toys R' Us. This is the first video purchase I have been disappointed in buying. The other reviewer who noted the scary witch scene was right -- the witch sharpening the knife sequence was too scary!!! My daughter is still talking about how scary it was days later. While the other shorts on here were fine - the third one implied way too much violence for the age group that might normally purchase this -- I would not endorse this video for kids under six and/or kids who have not watched a lot of violence/scary scenes. The implied violence just seemed too inappropriate given the sweet, pleasant nature of the rest of the video."
1,Somewhat disapointed,Does not cut cleanly unless you attack a branch or stalk as near 90 degree angle. For the cost it is much inferior to my Fiskers Trimmer.
1,Terrible Packaging for Glue,"I guess this was a defective bottle I could not get any glue to come out until I trimmed all of the applicator nozzle away. I cut it back a little at a time until I was all the way to the base and yes I did use the supplied wire to attempt to poke holes as I went, in the end I decided to dispose of this poor product packaging glue and all rather than try to ship a big mess back. I recommend anyone seeking to buy this stuff to do so locally if you can, that way if this happens to you, you can return it."
1,WAY OVER PRICED,I HAVE BOUGHT MANY BOXES OF PAMPERS FOR 42 DOLLARS FROM AMAZON. TO SELL THEM FOR 59 IS HIGHWAY ROBBERY. SHAME ON YOU AMAZON
1,"With respect, but a poor work","I love Thomas Perry, who has written compelling and imaginative thrillers. Unfortunately, this is not one of them. The book seems to lift sections from his previous works, slaps them together with shallow, almost robotic characters and leaves me wanting. The ""Butcher Boy"" series, is in my opinion, now dead."
1,not worth it!,"I bought this movie as a gift because it was recommended as a movie that people who have bought the Whites of WV DVD have bought, so I thought it would be close to as funny as that DVD...no where near being similar to that documentary. It just begins and ends and most of the people on it aren't so much ""funny"" as they are just old and senile. My grandparents are more funny than those people. I wasn't impressed and I wouldn't recommend that you waste your money."
1,"A waste of money, in my opinion","Well, the cleanser is designed for athletes that are frequently on low-carb, high-protein diets, which I am. I've been hearing a lot about cleansers lately, and thought that I would give it a shot to see what all the fuss is about. The only difference that I noticed while taking this cleanse is painful bloating. Ultimately, this affected my athletic performance and even made me skip a few workouts, though I admit that I didn't last the entire 30 days. After three weeks I simply gave up, and have felt great ever since. Maybe it works for some, but not for me."
1,Looked better in the pitcure,"I received the item faster than I thought I would, and was excited about getting it, but was disappointed when I opened it because it looked better in the pitcure. I intend on returing it. Darn."
1,Pardonnez moi ...,"The strokes are NOT raw or edgy -- They are Pop rock, nor are they part of any ""revolution"". They have songs you can listen too but PLEASE PLEASE don't say they are the saviours of Rock Nad roll or compare them to any other band. This album is what it is -- nothing spectacular at all.gimme a break."
1,AeroBed Mattress Topper,"I am very disappointed in this product. It will not stay inflated on either side of the bed and I have searched and searched for leaks and can't find any. I have called AeroBed who has discontinued this product, so you can't look to them for support. I won't be purchasing any more products made by them."
1,Look good but very uncomfortable,"The shoes look great, but the leather is very stiff, which makes the whle shoe unflexible and the upper rim is actually cutting into my foot when walking. Tried wearing it in a bit, but doesn't help."
1,No resonance,"Sorry, but this album was a big disappointment! All the rave reviews here on Amazon inspired me to buy this album...but having listened to it very few of the songs in this album are anywhere near a 5 star rating. Most of the songs leave me cold somehow...they just don't resonate with my feelings. Buy e.g. Otis Redding instead."
1,Lots of names - Little information,"There are a lot of names here, but very little information - only one sentence on my family, which I already knew. I expected more information or at least a source to go to for more background. OK for generic research only for rare names."
1,No Battery!,The pedometer booklet says it includes a battery. All it included was a black rubber foam circle where the battery should be.Now I have to buy a battery! I definitely feel cheated by this company and do NOT recommend this product.
1,I enjoyed it but it wasn't as good as it could be,"This was a okay book but a lot of words were said about nothing, especially in the first 3rd. It was a bit fluffy and all over the place and Dumbledore is made out to be pretty dumb and it kind of shows how dumb he was in the other books. Hermione and Ron are pretty weird how they don't believe Harry's suspicions. It's not like he doesn't have a history with this sort of thing. So even though parts were more mature, parts were still very unrealistic and over drawn out for suspense."
1,Don't believe the product description.,"Product description states that the item ""includes a powerful ultraviolet LED penlight and a UV ink marker."" Product that was delivered stated that ""ink can only be seen with UV light sold separately."" Very poor value.Note: Product description has been amended after the date of the above review. My rating does not change, however, as the product is totally useless without the UV light which the vendor does not sell separately."
1,Absolutely Terrible.....,"The Linksys adapter is terrible. The sad thing is that it is the one that is listed on the Tivo website. I brought this product less than a year ago and unfortunately it stopped working. I wish that I would have read the reviews on it but I TRUSTED that the Tivo website would only endorse a good product.Although the door didn't break off, the adapter no longer picks up an internet connection from my ethernet cord but when I plugged the ethernet cord into my Mac it worked perfectly. I'm extremely upset because I am unable to record any shows until I get another adapter.I'm going to get the Belkin adapter and pray that it works.Word to the Wise.... DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT IT WILL BREAK!"
1,Total crap!,"Putting it together was no big deal, however, the flag decals look like they were cut out by a three year old. The edges were cut at terrible angles. I had to re-trim the edges to try and get them pretty straight! The dragon adornments were tacked on with little nails, right smack in the middle of the plaque, and not even at all. In fact they were quite crooked! They are made out of thin tin, and I had to bend them up slightly with the edge of a sharp knife so that I could tuck the edges of the crooked flags behind. They only included enough small black rubber bands for five belts. (I only used two per belt, to hold each side). They did include plenty of semi-clear strips of adhesive type tape to secure the rest of the belts on the slats. All in all, this product cost me about thirty dollars with the shipping. Probably worth about five bucks! The box says ""Made in China"", and I hate to sound stereotypical, but,.........FIGURES!"
1,Eh...not so good,"I bought this 3 months ago, always kept it on the lower oven rack, not on the bottom of my gas oven. I hand washed it when dirty. Now it is cracked, and a white color around the cracks, it has holes in it, looks horrible, and it's no longer protecting my oven floor. It's getting tossed out. The concept is good but it's a flimsy product, not worth the $$."
1,".....well,it is a B movie after all.....",It's everything one would expect from a B movie : bad special effects and horrible acting. Some of the minor characters did pretty good acting wise but unless one is a fan of Talisa Soto or Roger Daltrey or just vampires this is probably not the movie for you.
1,Morality matters,"Hmmm... ""Comics aren't necessarily for children."" That's what the comic book industry is saying nowadays. They were for kids though when we were kids. The comic industry has decided though that they aren't that way anymore. Therefore, nowadays, the Man of Steel isn't a pure hero anymore...he's a super strong guy who fathers a child out of wedlock. Green Lantern has one night stands that we get to take glimpses of. Wolverine drops F-bombs. The Human Torch's girlfriend gets to tell the world about her fireproof lingerie. Iron man gets to have a menage-a-quatre. Hmmm...Comics might not be for kids anymore...but these movies are movies that, honestly speaking, kids should be protected from.What happens when you don't? What happens when you teach all of the children to abandon morality? London comes to mind.Ladies and gentlemen. Please grow up."
1,No luck so far,"I've been following the instructions and so far no luck! I'm going to give it a few more weeks... after that if I have some babies I will up the star rating, it no babies I will change it to a one star."
1,Needs better engineering for the straps,This bra at first seem great. I liked the lift sling in the front and it was comfortable...for the first hour or so. Then I started to feel less and less comfy and less support. When I took it off I realized why. The metal piece attaching the strap to the back was sideways. it is like there is not enough material to fill the slot and it turns and just becomes uncomfortable. This is my last resort bra these days.
1,SCRABBLE DOES NOT WORK ON XP,This product and manufacturer do not disclose that at least Scrabble does not work on XP. Do not buy this version if you run XP.
1,Dated Information,"Don't waste your money on this 1989 video...poor visual, pc's with 5.25"" floppies, talk only...no graphics...dated information."
1,Too much advertising / too little sweating,"I don't like the fact that there is so much advertising for the brand of water they use in each of the workouts - it's pretty annoying. In one of the workouts, they actually take a break of several minutes while the instructor talks about how great this water is.I also felt that the workouts were more on the low impact side, and I didn't get that great of a workout from them. With most of them, I barely break a sweat. Also, some of the workouts spend too much time teaching the routines and then breaking in between - which amounts to too much down time for me.I might use this for a light workout or for days when I don't really feel like exercising, but it certainly won't be a regular for me."
1,Incredibly tedious and self-indulgent,"I rarely discard a book when I am finished reading it--but I want to save at least one other reader from wasting hours of precious reading time, and so I am recycling this one (or perhaps I will drive a wooden stake through it). I am a history buff, and a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of the literature program at UCSD--I am not a reader without patience. After the first 200 pages, it devolved into an endless travelogue--libraries and monasteries in country after country, blurring into each other to no purpose in either plot or character development. I kept going gamely for the next four hundred pages, and although I became increasingly bitter, I vowed to see it through. The last one hundred pages are interesting, but the suspense had been sucked dry long before."
1,Required Reading...For School,"I have had to read this book on two separate occassions, both in high school and college. I still wonder why. While it does give a somewhat humorous look into everyday life in communist Russia, the stories have seemingly very little significance (perhaps that is the point?). I have trouble finding this book's relevance to classes. I guess some literary works are timeless...this one is not."
1,Not what we wanted,"Looking for a can opener to match the Oster Metalic red - this looked like it the picture, but when it arrived, it is a plastic red and doesn't match the rest of the Oster line."
1,Not again!,"Always a dis-pleasure to know that the daughters of 2nd rate, over the hill pop wash-outs are at it again. Michelle Phillips' claim to fame is she was lucky enough to have slept with the guy who actually wrote the songs that made her famous, and the alure of the Beach Boys went out when people who surfed their lives away in the 60's actually found something to do with their lives. And now her daughter wants to carry that tradition on. God rest the soul of John Phillips.Flying high on only their family names, this trio of wanna-be's have proven with their latest effort, that they can only record covers of previously successful material rather than try something original."
1,There are MUCH better ways than this,"This product cost me $40 for 2 rolls, 4 hours 'install' time and 2 hours cleanup after the attempt ultimately failed. Gila film is very difficult to use, especially on larger windows. And good luck getting it off - hint - use paint thinner and a wide razor blade. I did 3 of 6 windows, gave up, took it all off and purchased spray-on frost instead to do all 6 windows. Save yourself some trouble and look for other options for getting privacy."
1,Talk about pressure,"As if things weren't stressful enough with a newborn in the house with all the expectations of the baby, the new mom and the family and friends hovering over....this book just makes things worse. I only give it one star because it is edited and all the words are spelled correctly. this book is a bust. don't waste your money."
1,Good concept but.........,I ordered these seaweed snacks thinking it was a neat idea with the packaging making it easier to take to work and munch on but not sure if my item was old or packaging compromised but it tasted old wasn't crisp.
1,The crappest Hits remixed,"Not good for 80s sound fans. The remixes are not the original ones and if I was a DJ I could not play any of these tracks.They're all rubbish, they sound absolutely awful even the whissing and the the more you live versions are an insult to the originals.What a waste of money!J.C"
1,"Good Movie, Terrible DVD Production","The movie itself is great. It's funny with some great performances from brilliant actors. The producers of the DVD however have ruined the picture with very poor image quality, the worst I have seen in any reproduction of movies from that era. In addition, the ""delta"" insignia flashes on and off the screen intermittantly, distracting you from the show. The introduction and end comments from Tony Curtis are poorly edited in to the movie itself taking from the movie experience. Get the movie but not this version!"
1,wish i'd bought this on amazon,"I also bought this on recommendation by CI. I don't know how many blenders they used to test this, but if it was more than 1 or 2, I cannot believe they had no problems with this thing. The noise should have been a tip off right away, especially after CI described it as ""ultra-quiet."" It may be time to consider some type of class-action suit against Kalorik based on their homicidal product. I was also assaulted by mega-hot flying ball bearings after only a few uses, and actually have little dents in my stainless steel fridg Perhaps Amazon needs to start their own ""test kitchen."" I'd LOVE that job!"
1,Very poor historical fiction,"This is a very poorly written book. If you are a reader of French history of this time period, or of Marie Antoinette, you will not like this book. It reads like a romance novel ""bodice ripper"". Writers of historical fiction of course get some leeway with facts, but this is overboard. The author has the young Antoinia having an affair with a stable boy!"
1,a bit short of the mark...,"Well, it's a good story that falls a bit short of the mark... This movie could have been so much better. The fight scene in the bar was awful... The ending plain crash was just stupid, my 15 year old daughter could do better with Lightwave 3D and Adobe... It's cool if you live in one of the cities to see some of the locations they filmed in. You can tell it's a movie because the cars did not fall into Spokane's bottomless potholes and the actors where not harassed by transients begging for money or cigarettes every 5 seconds."
1,"Lame, Lame, Lame!","I really was not impressed by this one. I am a huge Brown fan, but what was she thinking?The main heroine was boring and a little wierd if you ask me. The whole story was really annoying to me."
1,Not worth $40,"I might give it a star and a half, if it didn't suck so bad. It has to be in the PRECISE place in the car in order for it not to sound like complete static. Very annoying!!! I hoped it would work better than the piece of garbage I had before (one of those 2AAA battery types). Nope.Don't waste your money on this."
1,Cheaply Made,"I understand that you get what you pay for, but this is just awful. I was expecting cheap, thin material, but this flag is beyond defective. The blue portion is skewed and at an angle with the rest of the flag. Also, the white one the left side is virtually see through so you can see the dramatic angle of the blue material. The bottom red strip is also perpetually curled up, making it look thinner than the rest. I am not flying this flag, but hanging it on a wall. I imagine that it would last only a couple of hours if I flew it outside. The only reason I am giving it 2 instead of 1 stars is that it is cheap, so I have to expect some of this. The best comparison I can think of is Halloween costume quality.Although the flag is poor quality, this was delivered very promptly. It was folded and packaged well and fit into a small padded envelope."
1,Failed to deliver,"While having problems with my girlfriend during those 'intimate moments', she suggested that I should do something to increase my self worth and esteem. I remember watching football games and seeing the players get psyched up by the cheering fans, so I knew the route to go. Unfortunately, when the item arrived, I was disappointed to discover that cheering fans were absent. I have sent this item back. Would not buy again."
1,Disappointing,I thought this was going to be something COMPLETELY different than what it is.... The lady isn't even that hot and how is she getting facials? It wasn't at all what i thought it would be.
1,SUCKS,WORST PRODUCT EVER DONT BUY TRUST ME! IT RUINED MY BRAND NEW $40 SEGA GENESIS THAT DIDN'T HAVE AN A/C ADAPTER YOUR LUCKY PUNKS!!!
1,OK,"I felt that this book did not meet the ""hype"" that my professor created for this book. Both he and another professor at my school raved about how good it was, although both myself and more thank 12 other students (in a class of about 20) were disappointed.First, the book contained too many grammatical errors--I found this to be quite shocking, especially considering that the author's partner is an english prof. I also purchased the study guide from the publisher, and it too contained a few too many typographical errors. Further, I found some of the examples in the practice problems to be inappropriate, given the weak explanation in the preceding chapter section's lesson.One positive comment I do have is that the approach or theme that the author uses from the very start of the book (using the ""simple society"") definitely indicates that the author made a sincere effort to reach his less-experienced undergrad audience. Perhaps the subsequent edition will be an improvement?"
1,Disappointed,"I feel I missed something in addition to fifty dollars. I am a new swimmer with fears of the deep end. While the instructor's guidance on staying in your body is good and well taken, the rest of the video does nothing for someone who needs to overcome a fear of deep water. Had I been aware of the lack of content in this product I never would have spent the money. When it was over I could not believe it! I literally just stared at my computer screen in disbelief. What a pity. Wish I had my $$$ back. Oh well."
1,Latin America?,"This is basically Mexico's answer (tv azteca) to Operacion Triunfo/American Idol etc. Seems like every latinamerican country has its own talent contest going on so the ""latin american"" reference in the description is extremely misleading. Unlike Spain's Operacion Triunfo with David Bisbal, no real crossover star has emerged from this show, although the winners tend to be quite succesful in their own country."
1,A dismal book saved only by the last page,"I am very disappointed by Grisham's effort here. His writing has become completely droll and predictable. Am I the only person getting tired of the same downtrodden Mississippi lawyers fighting the same corrupt agencies while being completely perfect and omnipotent at the same time. His writing has become a complete bore. The only saving grace in this overly melodramatic sob story was the intriguing ending. My suggestion is that you read the dust jacket and the last ten pages, then go find a classic to convince yourself that good literature is still out there somewhere. Maybe even in Grisham's world"
1,Won't get fooled again,"As most of the other 2000+ readers have stated, we won't get fooled again. My post is a vote against the double dipping or duping by the studio in order to sell a movie twice. It looks like Avatar is doing the same thing. This is really insulting to the intelligence of the audience that made this movie a success. I won't buy the theatrical version which probably all of us already have sitting next to the extended version. I predict the Blu-ray extended version will be offered for Christmas explotation this fall."
1,Aweful! Buy this book instead:,"I downloaded Kevin Trudeau's book cures they don't want you to know about, and he doesn't give any cures in it. Not even suggestions. He just directs you to a website that wants you to pay every month. Can you say SCAM?If you're interested in naturally curing yourself I've found a better book written by a MD: Natural Health, Natural Medicine by Andrew Weil, MD. I'm to chapter 4 now, but the first chapter gives more information THAN KEVIN TRUDEAU'S BOOK IN ALL.Don't waste your money on this hack. He complains the whole book about the government and wines the whole time."
1,Dated Book - Best Options 10 Years Ago,"This book is so dated that it misses a lot of the best spots and (accordingly) can't possibly provide the Best and Most Romantic Weekends. The pictures are nice but, since this book is published in 2000 and most reviews then are from 1999 (at best!), the ratings are very dated and new establishments which own the local market are not eve mentioned."
1,"If I could give it 0 stars, I would.","Garden State was the most pretentious sack of crap I've ever seen. It is second only to Broken Flowers. I couldn't even finish watching it, it was so bad. I couldn't figure out if it was trying too hard or just not trying. It was thrown together by a group of people who just wanted to look clever. It didn't work. It's an hour and a half of your life you'll never get back."
1,Not at all satisfied,"I'm honestly puzzled that anyone could be happy with this case. First of all, it is very difficult to insert the iPod into the iSkin, and the iSkin does not fit tightly over the plastic insert. I cannot get it to stay wrapped around the iPod, the edges keep peeling back. Secondly, there is no hole in the iSkin to access the hold button, which I would assume many iPod owners make frequent use of. On the whole, this seems to me a poorly designed and overpriced product."
1,Could not proceed after one fourth of the book.,"I bought this book because of the subject matter, thinking it could be fascinating and if I could have gotten past the terrible language and the taking of diety's name in vain every sentence, I might have found some merit. Why could'nt the author just have told the story without the garbage. This book is going in the trash. Sorry."
1,Pete,"I thought the first two books of the series were great and the third was good, but this was a major disapointment. Almost the whole book is a flashback that has nothing to do with the main dark tower story. And it's a sappy lover story to boot."
1,Not worth it - try Barron's,"I used both this Princeton Review book and the Barron's ""How to Prepare for the GRE"" book. This book was much less helpful - having less example problems and less helpful hints/tips. The vocab section was small and didn't have any way to test yourself.Additionally, the practice CD (and 'online tests') are incredibly repetitive (of the example problems and themselves) and thus are much less helpful. I would NOT recommend this book - there are better ones out there."
1,"Basic, Commercial","I, for some reason related to my enthusiasm for the subject, was really excited to read this book. Unfortunately, it essentially reads like a compilation of promotional material about products and a number of artists. Nothing original here. If you're reading this, you obviously have an internet connection and access to much more information than is in this un-original text."
1,Ridiculous!,"I really don't care about whether the book has historical inaccuracies; that's why it's called ""FICTION"". But what I could not stand was the plot's complete lack of plausibility. The author is almost trying to mimic the formula of the success of the Da Vinci Code but fails miserably. Da Vinci Code succeeded because it was able to interwove the historical facts and fictional aspects and made them BELIEVABLE and entertaining at the same time. However, this book does neither. Characters are very stiff and shallow, often you don't understand why and what they're doing, and the interaction between the main character and his ex wife is so cheesy that it's like reading conversations between two junior high kids. Save yourself from wasting hours of your life by NOT reading this book."
1,Racist Propaganda,"Note the accents of the different animal races.Note the accents of the hyenas. (what ethnic groups do they represent?)What happens when the races are mixed? (devastation to the land)What happens when the races are again segregated? (happiness)The rabbit hole goes much deeper, this is just a small taste of the hidden messages in the film."
1,Crap,"This baton sucks so much, it breaks very easily, it broke the first day i had it when i firmly tapped it on a log. do not buy this or you will be very disappointed. WASTE OF MONEY, i am disappointed in amazon for having a crap item like this."
1,DID NOT ORDER THIS ITEM,I DIDNT ORDER THIS ITEM AND DONT KNOW HOW THIS PERSON GOT MY E-MAIL ARE CREDIT CARD INFORMATION
1,DISGUSTING!,"This was the most insulting book I ever read. The hero cheats on her constantly! He admits to it and tells Clara that he probably will do it again while he is confessing his love for her. The kicker is that she tells him she will keep forgiving him because she loves him! What kind of a stupid girl is that! Not only is she a cripple, she is also mentally insane as well. What a stupid story!"
1,Keep looking,"It's my first bluetooth, so I can't compare it. But I have several complaints:1. The blinking light. I shouldn't have to stare at it for 3 seconds to see if it's on. And it doesn't serve any useful purpose except to annoy others while it's in my ear - I can't see what the light is doing!2. I can't hear with it in the car without pressing it into my ear. So much for hands free - I might as well be holding the phone.3. Every one complains that they can't hear me and the sound is tinny.4. My first one died after six months. The replacement died in a few weeks. And even under warranty, this isn't much fun, since you have to sent it back and wait 5 to 7 business days for a replacement."
1,Too heavy,They are way too heavy. Don't think I can wear them ever. My ear looks like its carrying a lot of weight ...ears droop downward
1,These fell apart 2 months after I purchased them,"I have been a distance runner for 8 years, and I have always sworn by Asics running shoes. When I purchased these shoes, they were great for the first two months. Then, last night, I noticed the black treads on the bottom had started to peel off already. Now I have to buy a new pair of shoes as a result. I will never buy Asics again, and I don't suggest that you do either unless you enjoy spraining your ankles."
1,Outdated technology,"The hype surrounding these speakers is disturbing. Yes I actually own a pair of 901 Series VI Walnut finish speakers complete with stands and equalizer, so I know what I'm talking about.If you pay full price for these you will be disappointed. The low bass is almost nonexistent and the treble is also nonexistent. You will need to crank up your bass to extremely high levels to compensate, and the treble that is there is very harsh. The direct-reflecting 901 requires a wall positioning with no nearby clutter and the speakers are not shielded so keep them at least 3 feet away from the television. It does give an 'airy' sound but somehow manages to completely destroy the stereo imaging in the process.These would make good DJ speakers with a powerful amp, but are useless for any other music application I can think of."
1,How could this be made?,"Ok, the only thing good about this cd is the ""Why can't you free some time for me"" song. All the others were basically Armand being self-indulgent and making tracks for his friends and him to laugh at rather than for us to enjoy. LEts not even touch on how bad armand is at raping. Please Armand, lets just stick with what you do best, making house tunes. More ""You dont know me"" and Flowerz"" and Less ""Kentucky Fried Flow"". Please Spare us all. No one buy this cd, worst piece of [...] ever put on a disc."
1,Very disappointing,"In addition to requiring a $150 per hour computer specialist to load, the software removed the calulator function off my Blackberry.I'm sorry I bought it."
1,Misleading - package says 'does not treat nail fungus',"I should have done a little more research, but when I received this product, it clearly says that it is not effective on nail fungus. I just thought that a product called ""Fungi-Nail"" would work on FUNGUS on NAILS. Oh well. You live, you learn."
1,Shows potential,"""Based on a true story"" is no 5 star album, but I can't deny that it shows alot of promise. Unlike their previous record, which was a total punk-pop joke, TSL have matured and turned into real songwriters. At times, the ""mature"" listener may find themselves a little put off by the overall manufactured sound of BOATS, but it's easy to overlook with kenny's sweet, melodic voice. I couldn't really enjoy ""Based on a true story"" for more than two listens, and my guess is it'll (my copy) be up for sale within the next few days. I guess the easiest way to break it down is; Good Charlotte fans will give this 5 stars, while fans of The bravery and Coldplay will give it 1 or 2. It all just depends on what stage you're at musically. 2 solid stars."
1,Crashes and bugs.,"I had all kinds of errors with this game... you should buy it on the XBOX or some other system, not for the PC. I had problems installing it, installation takes very long with what, 4 CDs, and at the very end I had to repeat the whole installation process. Then I updated to the only patch available, and the game started, but the introduction cut scenes had major clipping problems, and, then, as soon as you get to the point where you are actually to start playing the game, it crashes to a blue screen, locking up the PC. I'm running Windows XP, and yes, I've been through all the troubleshooting steps, Atari is trying to pass the ball, all my drivers are updated, and every other DirectX game on my system runs flawlessly, but this one is seriously buggy. If you have to get if for the PC, wait a few months and hopefully Atari will come out with some more patches."
1,Terrible support!,"We have had a royal shredder for a few years now, and it is a huge dissapointment. It is not dependable, but the worst thing is the manufacturer is nowhere to be found! Forget service for it--forget Royal Shredders!!!!!"
1,"If you like to mime, buy this bluetooth","This bluetooth worked all of 2 - 3 minutes. After talking on it for a couple of minutes, the person on the other end could not hear you anymore. It happened on every call. I finally had to return it. I will not be purchasing another Jawbone bluetooth."
1,A dissenting opinion,"This is a mediocre album. Certainly Unchained, Mean Streets, and Sinner's Swing are exciting songs but the rest of the songs on this album are very poor by Van Halen standards. The guitar work is excellent, as always, but most of the songs are just not good enough to keep the interest going. Only for the hard-core Van Halen fan."
1,WORTHLESS!,Ripped immediately while trying to put on suitcase. Save yourself the trouble and dont buy this flimsy worthless piece of paper.
1,A Straight Up Piece of Junk!!!,"I should have read the description more carefully, I guess! This watch is a straight up piece of crap. I has all these functions that are so useless, unless you are really interested in the Sun, moon and tides. I basically bought this watch, because I thought it looked decent and was looking for the basic normal functions. I wore this watch a couple of times and I'd look at the watch to check for time and it is showing me some mess about degrees of the sun, tides or moon! I am then having to press buttons to get back to the basic time of the day function. I would definitely not recommend this watch to someone that is looking for a nice watch to keep and display normal time and date functions!! Mine now sits on a shelf or in a drawer useles!!!"
1,Fake,"Don't get me wrong, the film is real but edited; the audio is all overdubbed - a helicopter drones in the background the entire time while THE SAME TWO GUYS take turns alternately crying ""Oh no! He was just trying to get away there!"" ""The officer just struck him as he was running away!""Well not really - it always picks up with the second half of the chase, and for all the examples they show only 1 or 2 seem possibly legitimate. This is no ""Rodney King's Greatest Hits""...Obvious propaganda. I hoped it would at least be faked better than this."
1,Useless,"I took 4 of these on a trip to the sea - to surf and snorkel. NONE of the underwater shots turned out, and the above water photos were so grainy and washed out I tossed them into the trash.Very disappointing!"
1,Disappointing,"This movie was disappointing, especially since I normally like Steve Martin. The movie had some touching and funny moments, but all in all it was entirely unrealistic, and at times over-dramatic to the point of being corny. There was also a blatant stereotype of wealthy southerners, and the entire legal aspect of the movie was unbelievable to the point of becoming ridiculous. The child actress was noticeably less than convincing.Still, Steve Martin delivers a decent performance, and the film is ""charming"" in a strange sort of way. But this it definitely not a quality film."
1,Not bad... for what it is. But ultimately junk,"I give it 2 stars because the music and arrangements are above-average for the genre (Euro-Metal?). However, the individuals behind The Haggard don't actually play the instruments! The biggest problem here is the absolutely ridiculous vocals. Please...the 'roaring like a monster' is just SO BAD and so *SILLY*. This CD begins with some promising music & drama but quickly descends into some kind of cheap adolescent nightmare. I could have given it 4 stars if they avoided such obvious marketing gimmicks. Pass this one by."
1,Not the best taste in the world,Would not recommend this product - out of all the multiple brands of goose pate I've tried so far this one tasted the worst.
1,Do not Buy!,"Hello,I thought this would be an informative DVD to improve my Interviewing and Interrogating skills. As the other reviewer wrote, it looked like a poorly done old movie and they did not even finish the interviews or the investigation. The whole thing just ended as if there were a second part or another disc.HIGHLY NOT recommended."

1,So this is Comedy?,This is not a comedy. Do friends really talk so nasty? The story could have been very funny and did have some soul touching moments. The end was predictable and but the dialogue was a epic let down.
1,Waste of Money,"This wheel/tire cleaner didn't do any more than what a sponge, water and car wash soap would do. I have a lot of brake dust on the rims of my front tires (Lexus) - that accumulates quickly in less than a week or twos time. We had to use nearly the entire bottle, let it soak for 10 minutes, and after rinsing, still had to use a rag to wipe away the rest of the brake dust. It burned my boyfriends eyes and he had to leave the car outside for 30 minutes to avoid being poisoned by the toxic fumes. WASTE OF MONEY!."
1,Punk World Magazine editor Spikey Joe,"""Monotnous drogeny should be the name of this Avail effort"". Unlike such bands as Dillinger 4, Jesus Scuad, Early Warning, this band sucks. It goes for the obvious bass line and unriveting guitar hooks. The secret track ( an accoustic ballad which expresses Beau-Beau's homosexual tendencies towards the bass player Brian.)sets the tone for the entire album. I meen come on homosexuality went out in the 80's along with slinkys."
1,Don't waste your money!,"If you want to hear your baby's heart, find another product. I'm sure there are uses for this device but, listening to a developing fetus' heart is not one of them. By the time this product becomes effective, your baby will be big enough to produce kicks that you can feel and you'll forget all about those early months of pregnancy where you wanted to hear your baby's new beating heart."

1,Texas Lily,This book just drags. I can't get through it. The plot is very tedious. How many bad things can happen to one family.
1,How can I put this delicately?,"I really wanted to read this book. I saw it while grocery shopping and was intrigued by the cover; I really love stories involving creepy kids and the cat looked cute in an evil way, of course. When I got home with my purchase, I started reading it and soon discovered I just couldn't continue. Why, you ask? Well, I'll tell you - Johnstone's writing style is atrocious and I just couldn't bring myself to feign interest in it. He writes in small, simple, annoyingly terse sentences, making it very hard for me to get involved in the story. I enjoy rich imagery and his style does absolutely nothing for me in this regard. I almost feel bad writing such a harsh review for a book I didn't fully read, and any other time I might *briefly* consider trying again if I didn't think it'd be too painful. Maybe I'll pass this book on to my little brother if he can even stand it. I'd advise anyone NOT to buy this book until you actually get a look at it because the style is that awful."
1,Rock-a-bye Farm,"I have an earlier published book by the same author, different illustrator. This boardbook was disappointing. I liked the original illustrations and ending much better . This newer one might appeal more if I hadn't seen the earlier version."
1,Not so good..,"Foam does not bounce back. It collapses after several uses. For the price they are ""ok"" slippers."
1,Dont waste your money - Very Dissappointing,"I purchased this pump a month and a half ago and it is barely working. When i first started pumping it worked really well and i would get at least 20 ounces a day. Now it takes at least two hours for 4 ounces to be pumped.I believe the problem is either with the suction (tubing to flimsy and narrow) or the small size of motor that cannot handle even average capacity of pumping. For the amount of money spent is certaintly is a dissappointment. I intended to breastfeed my baby exclusively using the pump as my backup when i return to work and now after spending all that money i also have to buy formula for my baby in these hard economic times.The manufacturers need to revisit this product or reduce the price and its false claims. This is a legitimate review. I am from Trinidad, West Indies. If you know of any other more reliable pump please contact i am desparately in need of one. Please dont make the same mistake i made. Save your hard earned money!"
1,hard drive Damaged factory: (,"buy this hard drive, waiting to update, and came damaged, making click, click, click, and nothing, not recognized by the BIOS or LESS to want to format with windows 7"
1,$8 per use,"This thing goes through a spool every time I use it. I ended up throwing it in the trash. The auto feed doesn't know when to quit. As it gets near the end it starts spewing out too much and ends up shooting the remaining string out at high velocity. Useless, and dangerous."
1,Don't waste your money,Not quite as bas as attack of the killer tomatoes but close. Bad continuity and even worse sound track. Worse thanthe usual sci-fi sludge.
1,Out fo date,"My choice of this item was my fault. I knew the product was no long being widely sold and the model I selected was out of date and technical assistance was no longer being offered by the company, which is now HP. Also, I had not noticed that the product was primarily for PCs and I have a MAC. The sellers were very gracious about accepting my return, fortunately."
1,"Bought it got zapped, brought it back!",I bought this heater at Walmart for 12.99 pluged it in grabed it at the top to hold it while i turned it on and got a nice long jolt..... Needless to say its back at the store. The Lady behind the counter didn't beleave me dispite my plea and well now she does. Not a good buy..
1,Dangerous toy for hamsters and gerbils! NOT ADVISED!,"This and other brand similar plastic logs are dangerous.Our gerbil got his head (past his ears) caught in one of the small holes today (terrifying until we got him out).We almost had a major disaster. When I alerted people I know, one man told us his hamster also had gotten caught in one of these logs a while ago.They are good for mice and fish- that's about it. Too dangerous for gerbils and hamsters."
1,"Oh, come on!","I obviously missed the point of A Fine Balance. Other readers here have raved about how this novel captures ""that fine balance between hope and sorrow,"" etc., but what I read was an incredibly depressing story about a few characters with hopeless lives who are subject to endless acts of pain. In the beginning it wasn't so bad -- I thought, ""Okay, here are a few nasty things that these characters have to deal with. It's all part of the character and plot development."" But IT NEVER ENDS, and eventually any progress that the characters or the story actually achieve comes crumbling down under the weight of the ridiculous events that the characters are made to endure. Near the end, I started skipping the acts of torture out of sheer annoyance. I wish someone would enlighten me about what really makes this book so wonderful."
1,Ear Plugs,"I am not a big AI fan, and neither of the AI 3 finalists are that great either. Listening to Fantasia screech her vocals makes me want to grap ear plugs. She sounds just as bad as Macy Gray. Both have no talent and have horrible voices. On the other side we have Diana. She also has a lot of work to do on her vocals. She is to nasal and is hard to listen to. Given a choice between the two, I would have to go with Diana, who has a softer calmer voice. And I dont feel the need to reach for the ear plugs. Diana is to nasal, and Fantasia sounds like a cat about to die schreeching! Kids today have little to no talent, can not write or play their own music. Some can not even sing their own music. These kids need to graduate first before singing."
1,Really? From the most Ancient Text?,"I purchased Holy Bible from the Ancient Eastern Text with the understanding that the translation was from the most ancient text and therefore would be more accurate in interpretation than modern day Bibles. To my great disappointment and utter surprise, I find that this Bible includes passages that were added by later writers and scribes, texts that would definitely not have been found in the earliest of manuscripts. Note examples:Mark 16 is believed to have been added in the 2nd CenturyMatthew 6: 13B was added in the King James version around 1611 AD!Luke 22:43-44 was also most likely added in the 2nd CenturyMr. Lamsa, do you have an explanation?"
1,what a shame,"i can go and pull out all my cd's and come up with over 80 minutes of music that would easily be a reasonable greatest hits album, but they cheepshotted us. Why? I don't know, other then to try and make a profit by having a couple new songs. I love Cypress Hill, but HATE this tactic.Only reason i gave this cd 2 stars and not one is because i love the songs on here. Even though i have played each and every one to death before this cd came out, i was glad (previous to seeing the lacking track list) to see them finally release a greatest hits album. With efforts like this, they wonder why the music industry is suffering. give people what they pay for, a full cd, especially for those who had invested in all the prior cd's that allowed to make a greatest hits."
1,Only the score - not a soundtrack!,"I had hoped that this CD would contain all the wonderful songs that were in the movie - songs from the '70s, and of course Trisha Yearwood's hit, ""How Can I Live"". I was disappointed to find that the entire CD is instrumental - a score, if you will. Then I tried to find an actual soundtrack, but I don't think one was ever made. Too bad. It would have made great listening."
1,one star is even too much,Please please please Jenny STOP writing! Your style is AWEFUL for one... And you are misleading women into thinking pregnancy and birth is terrible... and painful. You didn't give birth you had surgery! This book is STUPID. don't spend your money.I felt offended when you said: epidurals why anyone would'nt get one? Do you get it now? You ended up with a C section and a blue baby! and not breastfeeding? You'd rather give COW milk to your baby (that you say you LOVE) then mommy milk... give me a break and get OUT!T.
1,"Few of the pages are funny + I totally agree when he said ""a real man knows there's no substitute for good help, support..""","Only a few of the pages are funny although most of them are below-the-belt jokes. For examples from page 5 to 19, he described humorous situations that happened because his last name was Dick.What I like the most about this book is one of Tim's philosophies. In Acknowledgments section, he said ""All men like to think they can do it alone, but a real man knows there's no substitute for good help, support, encouragement, or a pit crew"". I totally agree.Besides the two advantages listed above, the rest of the book is bland."

1,"ALGAEFIX kILLS KOI, DO NOT USE!!","If you want to KILL YOUR FISH, feel free to use PONDCARE ALGAEFIX. I followed the instructions to the letter with plenty of aeration in my 1,000 gal pond. The first three days went ok and the algae was down by half and the fish were not as active but ok. I hesitated to put in any more but waited for two and a half weeks instead of the recommended weekly dosage. Had plenty of aeration. Two days after applying second Algaefix my fish were listless and at the water's surface. I quickly did a water change but it was too late. Algaefix kills the big fish first because they require more oxygen. This company does not care about your fish, just your money. Why won't they change their label and say DO NOT USE ON FISH!"
1,Sporadically engaging film,"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest did it much, much better. Girl Interrupted drags up too many cliches and only managed intermittently to retain interest for me. It begins well, and I was genuinely fascinated by the way the film pulled us into Winona Ryder's mind, but after an hour I found myself looking at my watch and praying for it to end: None of the characters managed to keep much more than a slender hold on my sympathy; and I got the uneasy impression that we were supposed to look up to Whoopi Goldberg as some sort of strong, admirable maternal figure simply because it WAS Whoopi Goldberg, in the absence of any real depth to her character. The central character's emergence from the brink of insanity into a mature, upstanding young role model of a woman at the end of the film was rather too sudden to be believable.A nice soundtrack helped, but ultimately Girl Interrupted was far too patchy."
1,Better to rent it... than to buy it if you really want to.,"In comparison to Joan of Arc (1999):Starring: LeeLee Sobieski, Jacqueline BissetDirector: Christian DuguayThis movie doesn't even rate close to it. I give the above one I listed, a FIVE STAR rating. It was made for TV but it is definately worth the purchase. More so than The Messenger."
1,Stereo-RCA Male Cable,"Get yourself a3.5mm to Stereo-RCA Male Cable - 12 ft., available in 3ft or 6ft also, and then plug your ipod into a wall socket with your usb cable for a fraction of the price."
1,Ehhhh...,"Unfortunately this book failed to excite me at all. It wasn't wonderful, it wasn't terrible - it was just... average. The plot was straightforward and without any complexities, despite some strange elements to the murders themselves. I had hoped that the title character of this series would stand out in some way, but I did not find him to be particularly sympathetic at all. His obsessive nature was off-putting, and it was difficult to muster up any positive emotion for him whatsoever. The cartoonish ending - complete with the villains full explanation of motive! - fell flat for me and added to the rather inauthentic vive I received from the entire book. It never felt ""real"" or even all that difficult to solve the mystery. For a debut to a series, it simply failed to intrigue me to continue on with it."
1,No good,"This book is insightful but is not very well organized. Pauling jumps around from thought to thought in almost every chapter. The information is not outdated, but too many of his references are. So much so that it makes it unenjoyable to read. I wouldn't advise anyone purchase this book, here in the year 2000. I would go for one of his later books."
1,Gooble-Gobble......,"This book was one of many that heralded the insidious rise of the dreaded ""New Age Movement"" that never materialized. It's a bit humorous to see the author report as genuine nonsense such as ""psychic surgeries"", which have been thoroughly debunked. Her credulity is striking and colors the entire book. The 1980's were permeated with similar paranoid and ignorant thinking (""subliminal advertising""?, ""backward masking""?) A better purchase would be Michael Shermer's ""Why People Believe Weird Things""!"
1,Unusable DVD's,"The first and so far the only pack of 25 Maxwell DVD-RW's I have opened contained DVD's that were unusable. The DVD blanks would not record, over fifteen of them had to be thrown away. I have not contacted the vendor since I no longer have that info handy, but I will research it and contact him (or her). So far the few DVD's that did record, when played back, the DVD froze ever few minutes, making it unwatchable and so unusable. I have not opened the other three packs of 25 Maxwell DVD's I purchased, but anticipate the identical thing happening with them. Something is very wrong here. Aren't DVD's tested before being sent from the factory?Dr. J.W. Durrah"
1,boring..porkys was better,i had heard how funny this movie was and rushed to buy it on its release date. now i wish i could return it and get my money back. this was the biggest disappointment of 1999!

1,The pirate alphabet...,"ARRH!, AYE!, (spits) TEA?!: If you would like to see a Disney (read: children and pre-teens) version of pirates, by all means see this with the aforementioned--however, if you want to see something with an actual plot, with actual suspense and with an actual idea of who the heroes and who the villians are, instead of pandering to the actors/audience's idea of who they should be, stick with the Harryhausen ""Sinbad"" movies--also, Depp was much better, more believable and less ""quirky"" in the new ""Once Upon A Time In Mexico"" movie--THAT one deserves a spin-off with his character, not this hold of bilgewater!"
1,great concept but doesnt last,"INTEX SIT AND FLOAT purchased 4 of them for my trip to aruba for the lazy river..one broke the second day. bought home the next two broke, down to one. the problem is the piece you place your legs on it breaks. tube is unless afer that. WE ARE ALL NORMAL weight..if your heavier i dont suggest this tub."
1,Not so funny after all,"I was really disappointed in this book. The letters from all the made-up committees and organizations were so clever and funny, but the overall feel of the book was depressing. Teenagers with mixed-up, messed-up and dysfunctional lives. I was also offended by the amount of swearing in this book. I think the lady that wrote this had a great idea with all of her notes and letters, but I gave up on the book about half-way through and returned it very disappointed."
1,Support for This Product Is Very Bad,"I installed this product under Windows 98 and immediately had aproblem. When running the check mail feature, it would slowlyeat up virtual memory until the swap file was >1GB andI had to kill the process.. This could, of course, be a configuration issuerather than a problem with the product but the real problem started when I tried to get help. Barring paying their supportline to get their product to work, the only recourse appears to be a chat line. I spent an hour on the chat line performing steps which it was obvious to me weren't the problem. The mostannoying part was that some of these steps required a reboot and thus reconnect to the chat and when I did that, I was told the person I spoke to a minute earlier was ""gone for the day"". This happened twice in an hour forcing me to start all over and describe the problem and what had been tried,etc. until I finally gave up on them and the product."
1,Ho Hum,"Change the names, dates, and add a few characters. Then extrapolate a tiny bit. This is all in Thomas Hobbes who said it better, more completely, and more profoundly."
1,Slow moving predictable story,"The story is a very simple one but the action, so to speak, doesn't really happen until the final third of the book. It was a battle to get through the dry middle!Unfortunately the story is also exceptionally easy to guessand the turns of the story are not surprising in the least.On the plus side, the book gives a good glimpse at life in Puritan early American communities and their moral strucutres."
1,Silly Conjecture...,"How can you say that there is a bible code when it gets things wrong? Drosnin says Netanyahu would get assinated while still in office. the fact that ""Benny"" is still alive and kicking should be your first clue that this is not the word of God. What did Jeremiah say? The true test of a prophet is if his words come to pass. Drosnin's did not so there you have it!"
1,History of Rock & Roll Review,"This is not what I thought it would be, alot of talking and not enough music. They only play small exerpts of songs but never a whole song. It wasn't worth the money I paid for it. I bought it for my husband as a gift, he had seen an advertisement for a product like this on tv and wanted it because it had alot of old footage of rock bands and their music. This has too much talking and interviews."
1,Cheap packaging and no extended cut!,"Unlike the Ultimate Editions for the first 2 films, this just contains the exact same version of the film as the other editions of this movie. Sure it has some great extra docs, but after creating ultimate editions that include extended editions of the film with the great docs, this is a total let down and a rip off for the price. You should just be able to buy the extra documentaries for a much lower price since anyone who is buying this already has the film on blu-ray.After this debacle I will not purchasing any more ultimate editions, and these, unlike the first 2 films are not ultimate editions at all."

1,"Soap Itself is Nice, but Yet Another Shipping Problem","The soap itself is great, but I see that I'm not the only person to get a sopping wet shipping box with at least one now-empty bottle inside. It's not worth the hassle of sending it back to deal with, so I recommend just not buying it (from Amazon) in the first place."
1,"Fettuccini shape, inedible texture and taste.","I can't believe this was made and packaged for human consumption. I am still reeling from my attempt at eating it- spare yourself.Open the package and breath in the heady scent of... ammonia. But wait, they warn you of the authentic scent of Shirataki, and recommend that you parbroil the noodles to reduce the stench, excuse me, aroma.Once cooked you can enjoy pseudonoodles with the scent and consistancy of overcooked squid. Mmmm, so difficult to chew.Described as the perfect diet food for good reason. You won't be able to finish more than two forkfulls."
1,Expect the expected,"In a word, tepid. Record labels and big-time publishers spend tons of money to tell us who to like. You'd think they could afford to find the best of the best, but instead we get a halcion cover act like Norah Jones pushed on us in every outlet store, every bank, dentist office, funeral home, you name it.As expected of a multiple Grammy-winning debut phenomenon, Jones is joined on her sophmore release by a bunch of hacks (including one of my former heroes, Dolly Parton) who for whatever reason are routinely convinced to latch on to the new so-and-so like so many algae to so many fungi.The result? A dreary, mid-tempo exhalation of dead hits, re-worked in the style of wonder bread soul. I have nothing against Norah Jones' music, save its Big Brotherly pervasiveness and its exhausting lack of originality and charm."

1,"The kids might like it, but adults will see its stupidity","Frank Muniz comes back as Cody Banks in this lackluster sequel in which he comes out of kids spy school to track down a hispanic Dictator named Diaz who used to be in the Cia.Lame jokes are abound in this sequel as the jokes will pass you by without making you laugh, although kids might get them (like the chocolate surprise joke and millions of James Bond references)One aspect I didn't like in this sequel are the numerous racial insults and stereotypes in the film ranging from a middle eastern with a bad accent to a black Muslim who plays a trumpet!! Man I don't know how this on screen, it also explains why Roger Ebert gave this film a thumbs down.Still if you like dumb entertainment check it out.PS: Speaking of dumb racial stereotypes that girl who plays the blonde dumb bimbo who belives the lies of Cody is a near riot, at the expense of dumb blonde stereotypes.A few laughs yes, but is the movie good? No."
1,Terrible reliability; two failures after nine months,"I bought three of these mice and liked the price, as well as the ergonomics. However, two of them have completely failed after seven and nine months. Either the transmitter or the receiver gives up the ghost. I will be getting Logitech V220 as replacements for these pieces of crap and will never buy them again."

1,Horrible!!!,"This bootcamp is WAY too strict. I was following both the diet and exercise plan to the ""t"" for only two days before I got sick and threw up at the gym and nearly passed out! I am not an overweight or out of shape person. I already considered myself to be a healthy eater and I exercise regularly. I am 5'8"" and a healthy 125 lbs (size 2). For my size one packet of oatmeal, 10 cashews, and 1/2 can of tuna is not enough nurishment to keep me going while also exercising strenuously. The gym employees were ready to call the fire department, but luckily my fiance, a firefighter/paramedic, was there to check my vitals and get me back on my feet. The only positive thing I can say about this book is that the exercise program is effective. I think I'll be switching to Buff Brides in the future. I hope no one gets seriously injured from following this book too closely!"
1,More suited for a TV Show,"The acting was below average and the main character was none to bright, but there was some decent parts in the middle. This ""movie"" would have been much better cut down to about 44 minutes and shown on TV. Not as bad it is being made out to be, but liberal use of fast forward through the filler scences will increase your watching pleasure."
1,this book is out of date,"I think that most of schaum's series are out of date. In particular, Schaum's ""abstract algebra"" is not an exception. I bougut this book to prepare my course, Abstract Algebra 1. But this book was full of stuff which is not relevant to the subject. For example, it deals in matix and boolen algebra, which are excluded in most of Alstract Algebra courses in universities. And it doesn't contains stuff about Galois' Theory. Galois' theory can be called the aim to learn Abstract Algebra. I cannot help confessing that to read this book is to waste time. It would confuse you rather than help. You cannout build the outline of Abstract Algebra with this book. I think that it is becase this book was too old-fashioned."
1,NOT Laurie Patton's translation,"While it says that this is Laurie Patton's translation on the main Amazon page, this is actually Juan Mascaro's translation, done back in the late 1960's. This should be corrected immediately."
1,This is not the musical that Stephen Sondheim wrote,"Regardless of how much one might like this movie, it is not the musical that Stephen Sondheim wrote or even an approximation of what was performed on Broadway under the direction of Harold Prince. This movie might have some of the same stars and the same title as the Broadway show, but like so many Hollywood adaptions, the heart was cut out. In this case most of the songs were cut, subplots added and the focus misdirected. Buster Keaton's role, for example, was trivialized compared to the stage play. You might enjoy the movie but do not think that you are watching what was shown on Broadway. With respect to the technical qualities of the DVD -- the sound is fine, the images clear, the color is good. There are no extras"
1,don't buy this!!,"I love the Suicide Machines and the Rudiments, but restrain from buying this cd! This cd is really on Beach Records, but the guy who runs it used to work at Dill so he slapped that label on. The Beach guy is notorious for ripping off bands, and the suicide Machines have asked people to please not buy this cd. Don't support this fiendish scoundrel, and abstain from purchasing this cd!"
1,Very disappointed,"Well, this thing started out great and left me very frustrated. I have had it for 18 months and initially I was able to manage my schedule very well, although it was slow to put in new appointments. the trouble came when i tried to hook it up to Outlook, which I rely on heavily. ""No connection detected"" or something like that, was all I could get. So, the unit quickly became a paperweight when I couldn't back it up or update it from Outlook. Why should I enter all my appointments and contacts twice?I struggled for a while and still have lots of addresses in it, which really sucks because the screens ( I have TWO of these) both developed vertical lines that made my phone numbers indistinguishable.My son will be using these things for target practice as soon as I get my new Palm Z22. My advice: fine for basics, but don't rely too heavily on this thing, and it's not very durable."
1,The Royal Suckenbaums,"I'm going to spare the wrath on this one cause it's not worth my time, or yours. This thing just landed in my top 10 worst of all time list and is closer to the top than Billy the Kid Meets Dracula. I'm still looking for the humor in this pig, subtle as it may be. My girlfriend was relieved to find a family as dysfunctional as her's so she thought it was funny. My son was humored by the painted face mescalined-out Austin Healey crashing thing. I was mostly irritated by it all.If the popularity of this movie is not proof positive that Armageddon is near then Jackass surely is! And Gene, why the hell would you care that you might lose Anjelica Houston? Seems cause for celebration to me. 1 Prozac"
1,Muslim Born Confused Gay Writing about Islam?,"It was a great disappointed to see an ""educated"" Muslim Woman criticize her faith in such a primitive level of writing and lack of Koranic knowledge. I feel sorry for all her childhood disturbances with a violent father and a submissive mother, but instead of blaming her identity crisis on Islam (just because she was born a Muslim) why does not she go to therapy instead? This book is a clear supporter of the Anti-Muslim campaign in the Western World, no wonder Manji loves to defend the powerful Jewish Community. What a disappointment! Manji has trouble with her faith, her ethnicity and her sexuality. People from all religions have the right to question them, but if she is so ignorantly perplexed about Islam, why does not she convert to something else? Islam is never forced on anybody, and by now she should know it. Also, how could anybody trust a Muslim who dares to speak so badly about her own family? That just shows her rotten spirit."
1,Only one of the movies in set!!!,"Unfortunately, I purchased this earlier this year but did not open it until a couple of days ago! To my surprise and displeasure, the disc labeled ""Cornbread, Earl and Me"" is a recorded program for children (Thomas The Train) I am a movie collector in the process of upgrading old movies from vhs to dvd. Often, I don't actually watch the movies right away. That being said, I have had very good experiences with my purchases, and this is the first time this has happened!"
1,Avoid the English Version,"I'm not even really sure how great this game is. I generally enjoy the sci-fi type games, and I tend to lean toward strategy/role playing, so this title attracted me.I could get past the grammar and spelling mistakes in the translation, and the ridiculous character names and voices (obviously translation mistakes), but the game was nearly impossible. I can't tell if perhaps it is because there is something I should be doing differently due to the fact that the game was originally not written in English. Some of the controls don't seem to make sense, certain attacks don't seem to do anything at all, etc. etc.All in all, this ended up being a waste of money for someone who generally enjoys these types of games. When I bought it, I was expecting something like the two original Fallout RPG's, but what I ended up with I'm not exactly sure. Perhaps I'll try it again someday, but my first experience with this game was enough to keep me away from it for a good long time."
1,Ai...not that good,"These earrings are pretty and all, but they are way too tiny. Noone will be able to see them expecially if you have long hair. The earrings are a bit smaller than one of my fingernails. If they were a whole lot bigger i would of liked them but as of now it was just a waste...I wouldnt suggest buying these earrings unless they are for a little toddler."
1,Drew Peterson:Untouchable,"Even though Rob Lowe did a nice job in his role, overall I thought the movie was pretty poor. It definitely seemed like a ""made for TV"" movie. If you're bored, it may be something to watch, but I think there a lot of better movies out there."
1,Not what the picture says,It does not come in a case just a tin box and there are no wooden pieces nor does it have Chinese checkers.Pretty much not worth the money.
1,The most stinkiest Perfume Ever,"I bought this from Amazon about a week ago! I'm sure this came from a merchant through Amazon! Well I purchased this based on previous reviews by others. Well, when I sprayed this on, it reminded of a floor cleaner? It was very strong, loud, with a dry down of rose?? Eeeewwww! I had a hard time washing it off. Never again will I buy a fragrance from here!! Buyer beware! In the trash can it went!"
1,NOT as pictured,"I purchased this ""doodle pad"" for someone who likes to scribble while on the phone. As pictured and described it seemed like a great gift. Unfortunately, I should have been weary of the product name - ""Pro/Con"" - as that was what came in the mail. An ugly pea green color with two columns for, you guessed it, pros and cons about a situation.This seller needs to update their product information so that it accurately details that which they are selling."
1,Pure crap!,"I am generally a huge fan of hack and slash games but this one is the worst i have ever played. I payed like 7$ for it and that was a complete rip off. This game isn't even worth renting. If you want a good hack n slash try dynasty warriors, samurai warriors, crimson sea, or even nightshade(which is not much better). Avoid this game at all costs."
1,Unuseable,"This is a large book containing dozens of poems and stories. Unfortunately, since the table of contents is a flat file and doesn't link to the stories it is not possible to easily navigate through the book to find the item you want.Frustrating. I am deleting this book from my Kindle. I can't use it."
1,CAUTION: VAN DAMMES'S WORST MOVIE EVER !,"Van Damme is like one of those old rock bands with a legion of fans. The band is finished, their creativity gone, but, with every new release, the fans hope this will be their come back, but nothing happens: the new CD is worst than ever. This is what is happening with Van Damme, altough he made better movies than ""CYBORG"" after shooting this garbage. The movie is so horrible that defies analysis."
1,Not happy,Bought 2 and they just do not work very good. Sometimes it works sometimes it does not. Even when being careful to park the same way. My garage is not large so I cannot park more than 6 inches left or right of center. I have not even put the 2nd one up since the first was not working very good.
1,Nothing but problems,"I received a 12 ounce Brown Betty teapot instead of the Tea for One with the cup. I was informed that the tea for one presentation as described - with the cup - is no longer available, (so they just substitute without asking???) but British Delights could get one for me when I returned the teapot. Then why didn't they just send what I'd ordered in the first place? Color me confused.Well, I found out - the Tea for One they sent was beyond horrible. The teapot had a deformed spout which caused it to pour off to the side (seriously, it poured to 10 o'clock instead of 12 o'clock) and either the cup or the base of the pot was not properly round because they did not fit together as a tea for one should. Wouldn't surprise me a bit to find out this particular Tea for One set has been returned more than once.Needless to say, it was also returned."
1,Tori is a sellout,"This album was largely a disappointment. Tori Amos has lost her fire and her style, these songs sound as though they could have been written by any middle aged pop artist. Sounds as though the infamous ""piano humping"" days are over. The songs on the album are divided in the liner notes into ""gardens,"" which is a poor and fabricated attempt at giving the album unity. I wonder how much money Epic Records paid her for her soul."
1,Old London Melba,"The item that was shown was not what I received, I have been looking for the garlic melba, not roasted garlic, which is what I received.. There was nothing wrong with the product, not what I wanted though....there was a mixup on the website which has since been corrected.Amazon was great to deal with through the whole process.!!!!"
1,Chelby,Too much history and extra information. I was looking for basic information to understand numerology. This wasn't it. Greatly disappointed.
1,Clerical error,"Reading this book I could not get past the fact that my own parents stories are far more compelling. My father fleeing the communist Rushkies and my mother joining him from Italy. Proud hard working people who embraced America. Learning to read, write and work here as well as teaching themselves to drive. Both have told me that they would never have come here illegally. My father fled Lithuania due to persecution under threat of imprisonment but still would not have come here illegally. How could he flee lawlessness only to enter a country by breaking the law? The writer and readers of these books can't grasp this type of character and courage.They hide from the truth by using terms like undocumented workers. Leaving the incorrect impression that their lack of citizenship is only a clerical error. Decieving only themselves. My parents are the real thing and those who enter under a cloak of darkness are mere law breakers no matter how you spin the truth."
1,Very Loose Fit,It is a very loose fit. I'm going to have to shim it to keep it from moving a lot. This is a very poor design - try a different brand.
1,Not so good.....,"I am a really big fan of Lemony Snicket so when I saw that the game was 30 bucks, I immediately bought it and played it when I went home. I was very dissapointed since I beat the game in like five hours! It is very short and the replay value isn't that good. One part that is actually good is that you can build the machines, but, no offense, but they have kind of ghetto names. I mean seriously! The Levitating Loafers? The Baby Booster? Sure it kind of sounds cool when you first hear it but seriously! If you just got a Gamecube, this could be a good game to practice on, but if you've been playing a Gamecube for a LONG time, then I suggest you skip this game like I wish I had."
1,What kind of retarded name is that? huh?,"This book, bieng a member of Oprah's Book Club, is only suitable for starting fires. I would not read it if you paid me. Oprah should go away and never come back. So there. (Feel free to sent all kinds of nasty hate mail. I like it.)"
1,Not as great as it looks,"I have a very careful 3-yr-old who loves this book, and even he has managed to wrinkle and/or lose pieces of it. It's not a fun book for the adult. It has a few good aspects, but way too many pieces that are easily lost or ruined. The button page has odd-shaped buttons that are a pain even for adults to do and undo; the vinyl faces and house have way too many pieces which are stored in packets that make them all stick together in one horrible ball of plastic. The creators of this book had some fun ideas that don't seem to work that well in real life. I know a lot of people like these, but I don't really see why. It's a huge pain for the parent, and frustrating for kids under 5."
1,2 and a half actually,"I could really care less if a band ""sold out"" because music should sell well if it is good. Now Significant Other was fairly good and a hell of a lot better than 3db, but CSF.. really has some just terrible things happening to it. 1. Fred Durst, you know you don't have to use the f word every 3 seconds to be considered cool. 2. The band has gotten lazy, they know damn well that their album will sell well and it seems that this whole album sounds like a demo tape. 3. The ego has grown...and grown...and grown...and grown...4. Hotdog, sorry but NIN is one of my favorite bands and I don't really consider it funny at all.All in all it could've used some more time and some better songwriting."
1,Thermos Review,"I made this purchase to replace one that belonged to someone else that I broke during my first use. Drinks stay plenty hot, but the pump, handle, hinge, and lid are very cheap plastic, poorly designed, and easily broken. I can only imagine how bad it would get damaged if dropped."
1,What LA is that?,"Whenever I read a book set in ""LA"" I ask myself-- who are these horrible, sick, twisted people??? As a Los Angeles native, I've never had the misfortune to meet anyone as disgusting as the Clarissa-types. While I knew the book wasn't exactly going to be literature, I got tired of the mean spirited, shallow, self-serving ""humor"" and profanity. A spoof or a satire might make an amusing short story, but page after page after page after page of the same snotty, rude and ""not-funny jokes"" are not only tiresome, but aren't a good substitute for a good, entertaining story. As I said-- what horrible, sick, twisted characters."
1,I Hate this Vahki Vorakh.,I hate this vahki Vorakh because one day I was playing with my vahki vorakh then it's weapon broke. The same thing happned to my brothers white Vahki.
1,Dialer Defective,"The Dialer unit AD-433S went out in 6 months. Skylink sent a replacement, now the replacement has gone out (absolutely no power/dead in the water) and Skylink says ""our replacement units do not come with any warranty"". Be warned."
1,Don't Even Bother,I bought this camera as a replacement for my stolen Sony. I figured Olympus was a good brand and for the price the camera seemed to be a great value- even having 6 MP. But it proved to be a mistake as the camera can not focus and well and takes horrible night shots. Also the camera takes pictures so slowly that you may miss the action you are trying to photo!
1,Very disappointed - got robbed in this purchase!,"I used this product only for 30 seconds.I have been using my Braun for over 3 years now. In this period I replaced the blade only once and I was really happy with the replacement. The first replacement, if not better than the original, could not be told apart - shiny high quality material, durable and long lasting. To my surprise though, this time, I received a blade which was made from the lowest possible metal quality, was already broken ""in the package"". I thought I had to assemble them myself. Once I got it in a shape which looked ok, I used it and I was about to break my glasses with the flying parts. I am a 6-year frequently returning customer of Amazon, but regrettably, I feel like Amazon or whoever else sold this product to me has robbed $30 of my money. Very disappointed!"
1,Outdated,"David Kibbe's book should no longer be on the shelf, unfortunately. The fashions are outdated and the ideas no longer apply. I recently went to his studio, haering about his expertise, and realized first hand that what was good in the 80's is no longer applicable in the 21st century. I think David's a bit of a fake too - he promised to send me and my sisters brushes and make up that we paid for up front, and it's now been over 6 months and we're without them. He also refuses to return any calls. Maybe he went back to 1984 and got stuck there?"
1,Buy it but don't expect Andrew Lloyd Webber,Elizabeth Walsh as Christine has the potential of a fine singer but in this production has very little material to work with. David Staller as the Phantom again has great possibilities but as before the material was in my view difinitely not Andrew Lloyd Webber.However in its favour the mirror scene was excellent but downhill after that.
1,Stinks.,"This pad works. Has great response too. Durability: no. This pad will rip and tear and fall apart. I was using socks and it teraed after awile! Not worth 20 bucks. I used socks on this pad and still it has ripps and tears all over. Now it is covered with scotch tape! This pad is crappy. Don't buy. After 2 months a couple ripps. 5 months, it's getting pretty bad.After 8 months it won't even be a pad! It will be covered with scotch tape! Don't go buy a dance pad for 100 bucks, but don't do the other extreme and buy this. Get a good pad for about 50 bucks."
1,EVER PLAY A GAME OF BLOODY MURDER?,"You'll wish someone had murdered you if you waisted your time with this movie. If I could give it no stars I would.Bad acting, stupid story, and just about every idea from other more sucsessful teen slasher films has been ripped off and used here.The picture quality on the DVD was clear, nothing special. The sound quailty had some background noise in it, I dont think that it had anything to do with the DVD, more so just from the low budget original recording on the film."
1,"Do research, find the truth","I was very disappointed to discover that most of this movie is unscientific fluff. I can't remember his name, but the professor from Columbia was shocked after seeing the finished film. He said he would have never agreed to it if he knew what the producers had in mind.The woman channeling the ghost from Atlantis (I wish I was kidding) is using it to drive a marketing campaign for her products.Do some research on the water labeling experiment. It turns out he only selected the ones that reflected what he was looking for. Meaning, he labeled 50 bottles of water with ""love"" and only used the ones that worked.I can go on, but you just need to research for yourself or talk to a real quantum scientist. If you like a feel good fictional movie, this is for you. If you're looking for real quantum science and it's impact on real life, look elsewhere."
1,Simply awful,"Now, I love pretension as much as anyone, but this was ridiculous! Most of the the ""filmmakers"" (if making a single short film can qualify you as filmmaker) are a bunch of unproven shmos who have no idea what they're talking about. They offer no relevant information whatsoever, unless you happen to have a lot of money already, or your parents will happy give you the tens of thousands of dollars you want to make you ""art"". A bunch of nonsense. Quiet frankly, if the book hadn't made me laugh so hard, I probably would have thrown it away after the first chapter."
1,More detailed information needed,"The first thing that I needed this book for was to replace a broken belt. The belt is in a difficult place to get at in the engine. This book does not even address HOW or The STEPS to replace this belt. I was dissapointed; however, the rest of the information in the book looks helful should I need to use it in the future."
1,"Pretty, but too fragile","I really like the way these earrings look, but it took about a half hour to figure out how to put them in and then the wires bent and broke within a couple of days."
1,Good story (fairy tale?),"I liked the book. I am a former member of a Special Forces Unit (not the SAS) and can say that many details of military conduct are correct. The author has knowledge about this specific topic. The book is entertaining, regardless of the question whether the story is true or faked."
1,Smiling Maniacs,"This is a typical awful Alpha Home Video disaster. SMILING MANIACS is one of several wide-screen Euro thrillers that Franco Nero and Martin Balsam made together. It was entertaining if lowbrow. Alpha's ""presentation"" is a muddy full-frame print with stone age sound. It's a disgrace overall."
1,Not worth the money!,"I bought it after reading very good reviews from users, but wish I could get my money back! I have tried all the FM radio frequencies and could not find one that is good enough to listen to my MP3 players. The background noise was deafening.Do not waste your money on it!!!"
1,"what's all the hubbub, bub?","I don't know what all the hubbub is about, really.The book took a neat idea that vampires are so beautiful they must shun the sun or be found out and then moved into a generic tale of romance that I never fully believed. I kept thinking that Bella got angry far too often over things that really would be mildly annoying.However, this is a YA novel, and I applaud the author for knowing her audience and writing with them in mind. This is every young girl's romance ideal: a strong man who finds a plain girl more beautiful and entrancing than anything he has seen. he's ready to die for her.How many romance readers are looking for exactly that kind of escape.It was a quick read despite it's breadth, which says a lot for the writing style."
1,Static constantly present,"In short, I'm disappointed with the quality of sound. Maybe Texas has too many stations, so it's hard for me to find a decent transmission of sound. Even 88.1 is an actual station in my part of TX. I tried several other stations; none where void of static, even though some had a lesser undertone than others. The hint of static was consistently present.It's kind of frustrating because I have a sports car and I don't want a bulky transmitter, so stylish wise this was the most suitable. I even read several of the reviews that were favorable, but it did not work for me. I guess its back to the drawing board."
1,"Great product design/layout, horrible functionality","As mentioned, the layout of the keyboard is great... It's comfortable, has most the shortcut's I'd want, however it's designed for Media Center, and Media Center only. No IE/Internet shortcuts are present, which in my opinion is a bad design. Everyone that has a Media Center PC, also has Windows XP ""professional"", which could use those short-cuts.My largest gripe about this product is the mouse. Why Microsoft makes you press downward, in addition to the direction of the mouse is beyond me. We've had it about a month now, and despite other users saying it gets better with time, ours has not. I was expecting a laptop-like fingermouse, and that's not what this keyboard has."
1,Glory in Death,"As most of the J.D. Robb books I have read are excellent reading, I am just now starting to read ""Glory in Death). So far so good.More later."
1,Not entirely as advertised...,"The curtains are satiny, they are very lightweight- those are true. The full product description says ""Each square piece measures 84 by 84 inches..."".The actual fact is, EACH panel measures 42 x 84. I purchased 2 pair for my 90yr Grandmother, whom is very dissapointed at this time. Because of the very misleading description, I must now purchase 2 more pair because they are so scimpy."
1,This was the only book I brought on vacation and I was miserable,I really wanted to like this book but simply could not! Forced myself because this was all I had with me over a weeks vacation but was a horrible read. I could not get interested in this book at all. The only time the book was at all engaging to me was during a conversation (at the end!) between Lottie and Cam. SKIP THIS and read her other books.
1,Perfume: HAPPY by Clinque,Did not smell in any way similar to magazine samples. Almost no scent. Very weak!!! Would not purchase from this perfume source again.
1,"mucho potential, but overhyped","I heard a lot about this guy and I really wanted to like this one, and yes, Wiley definitely has talent. But from the retro-hep cover design to the atmospheric but static arrangements and (over) production to the stiff vocal phrasing and show of affectlessness this is a disk that just sits there waiting for you to like it, or think its cool. There's not enough conviction/credibility, on the one hand, or pop grab for your eardrum on the other. The lyrics are fairly pretentious as well. Comparisons to Tom Waits and Bob Dylan are completely laughable. Potential is there, but might need to rethink where he's going with this. He's got some good ingredients but seems to be overreaching at this point."
1,Do not do either well,"Its sort of a vacuum and it's sort of a broom, but it does not do either well. The instructions tell you to use it as a broom to sweep the dirt together in a pile and then use the vacuum feature to pick it all up. But the broom is awkward to use, the bristles are too short to sweep normally, and it's too big and bulky for large sweeping motions. I would rate the vacuum power medium. It picks up light dust, but does not do well with large particles or hair. I gave up on the sweeping and just used it as a vac, but since its not made to be used this way, the battery dies very quickly. I'm off to return it and will try something else."
1,Not Worth The Money,"While this product does heat up as advertised, the fact that only the very tip does so makes it inadequate for my purposes at least. I have lousy circulation and wanted the socks for overall foot warmth at night."
1,Brutal war time,"The acting was good and it is a well made movie, but I really don't think all those brutal killing scenes were necessary to get the point across of how savage and inhumane the Japanese were in Asia, especially China. No wonder the Chinese still hold a grudge towards the Japanese and its goverment."
1,The perks of being a wallflower,This book was amazing. I cried when I finished 2 hours after I bought it! I encourage everyone to read this heartfelt book. Best book ever. Such a great story and I'm going to read this again and again. I loved Charlie and him explaining his life. 5 stars!!!
1,Not so hot!,Thought that I would love this product...did for about 3 days then the main zipper broke! Not worth the money I paid! Very disappointed!
1,Waste of money,It is truly flimsy and useless. Two cheap pieces of plastic that don't fit well are slapped together and sold for $30+shipping. It is completely useless - buyers beware. Mine is sitting on the shelf gathering dust..
1,"Avoid WRT54G it has be ""re-engineered""","If you are lucky enough to own an earlier model, then you no doubt feel it's a great product, and it was. That was before Cisco decided to ""re-engineer"" it and turn it into a pancake.WiFi router, hardly. I had one that worked for about a week. Then the speed dropped off to 125K and went even farther down from there.It was exchanged for one that lasted almost two months. It also dropped and dropped in speed until a tin-can-and-string would have been better.The third unit was dead right out of the box!Version 8.X is the re-engineered fiasco. Version 4.0 was the best.If you can't get a version 4, avoid this Cisco farce. They re-engineered it, let them keep it."
1,I love this charger when it isn't broken.,"This charger worked great for the most part. I have had the problem where it gets stuck at 85% and keeps running. When I disconnect it and reconnect it it reads 100%.Lately it started looking like it was charging but it wasn't charging. There is a relay internally that is undersized for 15 A and it had a burned out lead. I repaired it and now it works like it used to. It is really sad that this potentially great product is cripled by some cheap componenents.I also have had the fan problem with it being really noisy. I peeled the sticker off the fan and put some Lube-One lubricant in it and now it works fine.Like I said, this is a great charger when it isn't broken."
1,Didn't even work for 2 weeks,"This microwave was a replacement for a Sharp that we had for 15 years. This one didn't even last for 2 weeks with limited use reheating items. It started working intermittently, timer would count down and after a while the microwave unit would finally kick in. Finally the same day the microwave unit would not run at all.Tried unplugging it to reset the electronics but no luck.I'm very disappointed in the quality of the current Sharp microwaves. Would have given it a zero but that isn't possible. I will be buying another brand locally."
1,This book sucks don't buy it.,They should probably burn these. It's that bad. The title alone is probably why they have continued to sucker people over the years into purchasing this book. Get it off the market.
1,me,Didn't work as expected for my dog. Still seemed to slip on the floor. He is quite old and maybe nothing will help.
1,Flush,I liked this book but it does contain a few swears so I don't think you should be 10 to read it.
1,Non-stop mist only to wet surrounding area,"This unit lacks a fan or moisture control, it just continues to spray moisture and makes the immediate area wet. I don't think they should sell this item given the poor design."
1,tie my shoe[ in collectors condition],"This is an old book and was suposed to be in collectors condition. The spine was broken, the pages yellowed, and the cover has some staines. I was dissapointed in the condition of this book."
1,Couldn't get into it,"I very rarely stop reading a book in the middle, but this one gives you little reason to see it through. The characers are so poorly developed that each time I picked up the book, I would totally forget what was happening, and have to read two pages back. Don't waste your money. If you like the series, go to the library."
1,Milking fans for all their worth,"So Lucas yet AGAIN (the 4th time by my count) changes special effects in his fantasy saga in order to ""fix"" problems that were never really a problem in the first place (and to milk a bit more cash out of the die-hard fans). It would be cool, I admit, to see the deleted scenes from the original trilogy that he's been sitting on for so long, until such time as most people would balk at the idea of paying for yet another blatant cash grab. No thanks."
1,DEPUTY BILLY AND HIS MAGIC HAT,"AFTER SUNDOWN is one bad horror flick trying to mix the vampire and zombie genres to no avail. The acting, editing, script and effects show how small their budget was. And just how many bodies are in this darned morgue anyway? And what is it with Deputy Billy's way too large hat? At one minute, he's got it on; next it mysteriously vanishes; then in the next scene, there's the twenty gallon monster again. This movie offers nothing new for horror fans, same old jerky slow moving zombies, a vampire with no bite..a really awful movie."
1,Gary,"Print head problems, print head problems, print head problems. The whole reason for this printer was to reduce ink costs. The Kodak idea was to sell ink reservoirs and the print head remains in the printer. The problem with the concept is that the print heads wear out. Kodak, at the present time, does not sell replacement print heads. If you go through the laborious process of contacting customer service they will send you a new one along with some replacement ink ""cartridges"". They've done this for me 3 or 4 times. My question to them was why not sell the print heads as expendable supplies but they do not acknowledge that it is an expendable and don't have plans to sell them. I wanted to find out if, in fact, I would be saving money on ink if I had to buy the print heads.Saving money on ink would be the only reason to buy this printer. My $25 Lexmark has better print quality.In summary: it is poorly engineered and poorly executed. Buy something else."
1,Faulty and Dangerous,This is not a bargain. The brushes are cheaply made and quickly develop a gap between the brushing head and the head retainer. The gap can pinch (has pinched my lip) your lip and bruise it.
1,Couldn't leave well enough alone.,"Disappointing sequels are nothing new, but I have a hard time coming up with an example in any medium where the disparity between an original's quality and the follow-up's is so incredibly wide. Dark Knight Returns was Miller at his peak, Strikes Again is like a 13-year-old's idea of making fun of it. The dialogue is laughable, the drama is boring at best, the art gives no reason why it should stretch over expansive full pages the way it does. I'm an optimistic, forgiving person, but really there's almost no excusing such overindulgent, ill-advised trash as this.I'm a huge fan of the original, and even other work by Miller, but don't waste a nickel on this. His awful ""All-Star Batman & Robin"" run really shouldn't have been a surprise after this. Heck, if nothing else, Batman fans should stay away because he's hardly even a character in the book."
1,BEAUTIFUL EMPTINESS,"TRON LEGACY is certainly a stylish beautiful movie--so are many video games. But TRON LEGACY has about as much substance as cotton candy. We've seen the plot all too many times--good guy goes bad, turns into a megalomaniac wanting to take over the world. The acting is merely posturing and programmed. I just didn't get into it!"
1,Wrong Model,"I bought this item for my girlfriend who has a cannon video camera, and had lost the battery charger that came with it. I looked up the specs of chargers on the internet, found this battery charger, and bought it. However, when I went to put the battery in the charger it wouldn't fit. I was greatly disappointed that the charger did not fit our model. I'm sure it is a good item, IF it works with your battery."
1,Among the long-winded,"I should preface my review by making it clear that I am not generally a fan of hyper-descriptive, verbose writers in the vein of Hemingway. That said/understood, I found Among the Russians to be so long-winded and detail oriented (in terms of describing places, buildings, forests, etc) that it was difficult to get a sense of the people. He interjects tales of his human interactions sparingly and a bit chaotically, so it isn't the type of book that I enjoy. A balance of description, history, and on-the-ground human interaction is key in making a book like this readable and entertaining. His style misses this by quite a bit. That said, it is an interesting account of 1980's Soviet Russia. It is what it is, but it's definitely not my favorite."
1,Product NO SHOW.,Never have recieved this shipment. Wrote asking what happened to it and never got a reply... NOT a good experiance. Qouldn't allow me to do zero stars...
1,Publishing Industry Smiles,"Young man with thesaurus writes ""funny"" Holocaust novel. Gullible public, eager for ""prodigy,"" obediently follows publishing industry prompts. Book is not funny. Book is fatuous. Very little is illuminated. Gullible public, having been instructed that book is ""brilliant,"" leaps to defend its assigned genius. Outcry and debate only increase sales. Publishing industry smiles"
1,Dangerous item,"Hard to believe a toothbrush head can be dangerous, but these are. I didn't know these were not built by Braun. If they are, someone really dropped the ball at the QC station. The brush heads become loose very quickly. Aside from pinching parts of your mouth in the loosened gap, they will eventually disintegrate in your mouth. I have just ordered the Braun labeled heads and hopefully, they are up to the excellent quality of the originals. These replacements however should be avoided until the quality concerns are addressed. That's my opinion anyway."
1,Was great at first... but garbage now!,"When I first purchased this laptop from Future Shop I was overjoyed with the performance.It has been 3 months since, and now it gets extremely hot, the casing has warped all over the place from the heat, and anytime I open any application other than Internet Explorer or try to play music, everything grinds to a halt and then the laptop just turns off! What a waste of money!"
1,NOT FOR EXTERNAL HARDDRIVE ON WIN2K,"I have an older PC and I wanted USB 2.0 for quicker access to 1 TB EXTERNAL HARDDRIVE. The card works with other peripheral (such as Webcam, etc), but locks up and/or causes read errors with HD, which frankly stinks, since that was my primary reason for the purchase. FYI: I also had to do a Windows Update to hotfix WIN2K OS for USB 2.0. If you are not a bit technically savvy, stay away folks."
1,"The Real Story Behind ""The Star Wars""","The real George Lucas died many years ago in a galaxy not so far away. He was then replaced by a clone George Lucas. Sometime in the early to mid 1990's, the clone Lucas received a holographic message from Palpatine. ""It is time Mr. Lucas,"" Palpatine said, ""execute order 66."" The clone then looked into the hologram and said ""It will be done my lord."" And starting in 1997 we received the special edition vhs tapes, followed by three prequels.....then 2004 special edition dvds and now.............the complete saga. The circle is now complete, STAR WARS IS DEAD."
1,throw it out,"Once you start, you come to this village.you can't leave it until you have visited every shop and that takes awhile. When you get back to the farm, you can't find anything because you don't know your way around and you can't find the farm map and even if you can find the map, you can't get places cause it is out of order in comparision to the map.you tire out yourself just by walking around and cutting up plants. you can't do anything else. my opinion is don't buy the game. it is a waste of money. very disappointing."
1,Over simplifying...,"I bought that book on the previous ""don't buy this book"" review. I feel like should have listened to it.In my opinion, the analysis is oversimplyfing the problem so the whole thing has not much theoretical meaning nor practical use.Only my opinion."
1,Workout Shorts,"Bought these shorts for a basic pair to wear and workout at a sports club. The price was good, but the quality of the shorts is lacking. Very light cotton material - not much to them, and the elastic waist string doesn't have any strength or elasticity... wouldn't buy them again.... sorry :("
1,Don't bother,I did everything exactly as stated and couldn't get even one of the herbs to grow at all...They came up but quickly died.
1,Ugh,"I wish I could give it 0 stars. Very flimsy, horrible...unfortunately there is no way I can dismantle it and pack it back to return, ...what a waste"
1,Both have some growing up to do,"It's pretty simple: Justice and Kelly are a typical Linz pair, and if you've liked her couples in general, you'll probably like them too.I didn't, partly because I found them both tremendously self-absorbed. Justice never once thinks of the family whose child he saved, or even of the child himself; he is too hung up in his own guilty dilemma. Kelly takes ages to even consider putting herself in her father's or sister's place, or even Justice's after he hurts her.Get over yourselves, folks."
1,Outrageous Shipping!!!,"Roughly $6 each for shipping? That's not right. I ordered 6 of these and got billed more for shipping than the product. They don't bother to tell you they consider each card an item. Really, how much more does it really cost to ship 6 cards instead of 1? ORDER CANCELLED!"
1,the hardest book to read,While the book is informative there is absolutely no order to any of it. It makes for difficult reading at best. Try instead The Black Death by Gottried...a truly well written and highly informative book. Also flows in great order!!
1,floppy end of fin,"I'm not very pleased with my fins and perhaps I didn't read that the floppy ends of the fins would be hard plastic, but because they are there is not much ability to move me in the water. If this was mentioned at their site I missed it."
1,Does not work with Windows 2003 Server,"This product does not work with Windows 2003 Server, and it doesn't call that out on the box. This is 3 or 4 years after 2003's release and they need to indicate it on the box or customers like me will bring it home and it won't work."
1,Pure hogwash / so darn selfish author,"pure drivel... why this even made it on the bestseller list is beyond me...I'd rather read a teenagers diary, they don't sound as selfish and petty as Ms Gilbert usually. Don't waste your money or time."
1,Remastering Botch job in Haydn Variations,"Warning...The Haydn Variations omits a repeat in the Theme that is present in the ""Essential Classics"" version. This version runs 17:02 and the EC versions runs 17:30. Download that version if you want the whole thing!"
1,Disappointing,"I had the same experience as the previous poster. The belt is too thin to work with my buckle. I'll use the belts I got, but I won't buy from these folks again."
1,My Ghetto Report Card is not that good.,"My Ghetto Report 2 1/2 starsMy Ghetto report card is not that bad of an album, but it's not that great, E-40 Does his usual humor and antics, but it gets way too thing, although I Love some songs on the album and his writing if effective, but the lyrics are too heavy handed and too stilted, the production is decent, but what is the album trying to say?"
1,Perfectly dreadful book NO STARS DESERVED !!!,"If you loved Jane Eyre and Rebecca, avoid this book. It's hackneyed, poorly written, boring, full of overused cliches. Going by the rave reviews, I bought a hardback copy when it first came out and was really disappointed. Of course, I didn't care for Deep End of the Ocean or Lovely Bones so that may give you an idea of my tastes.However, if you like Nora Roberts and Danielle Steel, this is right up your alley."
1,No safety seal,"The bottles that arrive most likely won't look like the picture. I recieved bottles and lids losely in a box. If this was something for myself I might not care, but every baby item I purchase I have always made sure it is sealed for sanitary reasons - most of the items I purchase are Medela and they have the safety seal stating that if the seal is broken, the item cannot be returned, which i like - it makes me feel safer about the products I am purchasing. However, if I use the bottles, it will be helpful that I can freeze then un-freeze and feed without having to transfer from a bag to a bottle."
1,Did Amazons Ans Aliens design this game?,"This game is a Real Time Strategy Game. You know, the basics. Build a town, gather food, gather gold and stone, buil an army, build alliances, fight wars. But it has a few flaws. If you like to just start out and blow the smithereens out of your opponents early on, you won't like this game. And if you don't like hard management of your town and armys, you won't like this game. Also a few flaws like workers don't automatically take time off getting stone for building. Also u need a lot of free not needed workers to ""transport"" the supplies to the building site. It is not like command and conquer where you just click where you want it and it pops up. Or where just one truck or person builds it. For a large building you need 20 workers. And with workers you need houses. But you need wokers to build houses."
1,not satisfactory,"I used the probes for 2 plants while I was out of town. The water tubes didn't stay in the water properly. One plant completely dried out, the other plant had some moisture, but not as much as it needed."
1,"Nice idea, poor execution","Salvatore's blatant lifting of names and characters from various sources, most notably Tolkien, makes it difficult indeed for me to take this novel seriously. Perhaps it's not intended to be completely serious, but Salvatore's calling his main male character Luthien (a very important *female* character in Tolkien's mythology) and his native land Eriador (the western part of Tolkien's Middle-earth), not to mention Oliver deBurrows, a ""halfling"" thief whose dialogue is almost lifted from ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" really did me in, even though the story itself is not inherently flawed."
1,A Wanna Be Hero,"Zlotnick comes accross as some kind of Superman, Truely a wanna be hero. The whole Viet nam War revolves around him and his superhuman exploits.... Even has Generals asking his Lt. grade advice.He can't talk the talk and he definitely didn't walk the walk..Don't Buy It... Try Dr. Zuess, you'll get more out of it."
1,BEWARE PHONY SONY BALONEY ABOUT SXRD LAMP LIFE,"The lamp for my SXRD 60A2000 last just one week longer than the 1-yr warranty period. Without warning it just went Phht. So much for the lamp warning message Sony so proudly yaks about it the manual. BALONEY.4 hrs a day should have gotten me 3_ years. But reality is just 1 yr of service per lamp and then you have to spend 10-percent plus of original sale price to replace each year. I would never have bought this TV if I knew I would have to do that.PLUS, the phoney sony baloney people at sony style said my extended warranty would cover lamp replacements...but now of course they do not cover ""consummables"" (i.e. lamp replacements)Run away as fast as you can fgrom PHONY SONY BALONEYYes I am a disgruntled customer and you will be too!"
1,A Book That was the biggest disappointment I've ever read,"How could Thomas Harris have done this? For once in my life, I can actually understand what the main character in 'Misery' felt like when her favorite author killed off her favorite character. This book was a good read, until the end, which was an utter and complete let down. Yes, Thomas Harris has found new and interesting ways to scare, gross-out and disgust, and so if you are curious, then this book will satisfy some of that curiosity. Read this book only if you have nothing else to read."
1,Watch out Canada,"Supposedly America worries about other regional powers, because these might in the future promote a potential regional rival. Since Mearsheimer clearly worries about the rise of China, the appriopriate response for the US would clearly be not so much a strategy of rivalry with China, trying to hold back its economic growth, but, rather ..... take over Canada or Mexico now!"
1,Does not show forms,"I just received and installed TurboTax Deluxe 2004. When I went to view forms, all that showed was the data entry--no other info.When I went to customer support, there was only ""pay"" phone help or preselected topics--none of which address the problem. This looks like a coding problem with software that has not been properly/fully tested, and the consumer has no way to either infom Intuit about the problem or to get help except to ""pay"".The program needs to be tested fully before release, and if there are problems that are Intuit's fault, there needs to be resonable ways to get things fixed.As is, the program is unuable, the only recourse is to return it."
1,Contender's review,"A story about a high-school dropout whose best friend is sinking deeper and deeper into drug adiction. Alfred Brook, the main character in this story, was determined to help his friend by becoming a contender, no, a champion boxer."
1,Does not hold up in actual use,"I had high hopes for the Sanyo Eneloop batteries. They got good reviews here on Amazon and Consumer Reports gave them a reasonably high rating, and yet my own experience with them is that they are little better than your average AA when it comes to lasting in a digital point and shoot camera. I got maybe a dozen shots out of a pair of batteries before my camera, a Canon A590, gave up the ghost. Compared to the Duracell Power Pixes I was using, and which I can highly recommend, these Sanyos are a poor imitation of a battery."
1,NeverKinks kinked right away,"wow, what a poor product. First time i used it, it kinked. This hose is the worst hose i have ever had. Wanted it because it was drinking water safe but it was the poorest quality hose ever."
1,Poorly make hatha yoga video,All I can see is that this DVD was over priced for a poor hatha yoga video. I have tons of yoga DVDs. I was hoping this DVD would have some special stuff in here. Once I put this DVD in and started watching it I noticed that it had NO sound at all.No sound and poorly produced. I feel ripped out. Please don't waste your time or money.
1,I remember when this was popular,"There once was a day when I would have given the sickness 4 stars. But long since purchasing this, my music collection has grown considerably and I no longer consider Disturbed to be as great as I once thought of them. My despise for them probably came with my complete disappointment with Believe, that record sucked. As for the Sickness I find tracks 1-5, 10 and 11 to be listenable. Everything else is boring. The song Down with the Sickness is the heaviest song here, which was one thing that disappointed me when I first listened to it and has been featured in so many movies that its lost all meaning. Sorry kiddies, but if you want great metal, then you have to look elsewhere, Disturbed only live to disappoint. Check out bands like Malevolent Creation, Slayer, Sepultura (Old), and Vader instead for some real metal."
1,TERRIBLE MOVIE!!!,"I thought that this movie was going to be good based on the review everybody had left here, but holy crap! I was seriously mistaken! Im not sure if it was awful due to the poor filming, Kristen Stuart, or just the movie as a whole. I hated it. I regret buying it. It had SOOOO much potential to be a great movie, but it failed miserably.So, do unlike I did. If you think you want to buy it... Watch the freakin trailer on youtube first! I accidentally forgot to. And now Im going to have to either through this movie away or sell it for 1/8th the price I paid for it at a garage sell.Thanks for reading my review and I hope it was more helpful than all the other ones that were clearly written by people that had never seen the movie.Ps: I bought it ""new"" and there wasnt even any shrink wrap on it and there was a yard sale sticker on it. So to top it off I payed for a new movie (at the time costing $8) and it was used...Badly!"
1,sizes run very small,the 35 in. waist that I ordered were smaller then the 34's that I am currently wearing (Both Wrangler and same style)
1,Not My Favorite,"I like action movies BUT I do not like films that are dubbed. This package contained films made in Chinese and dubbed in English. If I had known they were not all English, I would not have purchased. There should really be a notice or disclaimer on such films so people know what they are buying."
1,No userful information,"Yes, ORDB does recommend this book for server administrators with open relay. However, this server administrator found no information in the book that would be helpful in closing an open relay. Complete waste of money and time."
1,Aside from a few piano solos this is drek!,"overloaded with soulless synth noise,this score gets it's two stars for the few moody solo piano cues included..One wonders if,in this new century,film-makers now go out of thier way to hire""composers"",like Armstong,who define""music""as being a few computer keyboard taps rather than something written for humans with both talent and real instruments,to actually play?I,for one,long for more John Williams,more James Horner,More James Newton-Howard,guys who write REAL MUSIC!I cannot,for the life of me,imagine why ANYONE would want to sit around FOR ALMOST AN HOUR,and listen to an album of""music""which,aside from a few piano solos,consists mainly of BUZZING COMPUTER SOUNDS ,all sounding very much alike...."
1,Expected more than I get,"I have expected more from this book. I was especially interested in HR section (ABAP query for this module is slightly different than for others), but there was nothing more than just basic staff. If you don't know anything or very little about ABAP query you can buy it. There is just little bit about reporting tree, how to create, change, etc it, nothing about interesting reports you may use. Few paragraphs are just for SAP beginners and few about staff like creating form letters in Word or about add-ons reporting tools like ARGUS. I think that just half of this book is useful somehow - this is a part about ABAP query."
1,Where's David Lean When We Really Need Him?,"Aside from all the historical and mythological errata, Wolfgang Petersen can't seem to handle actors very well. Most performances were over the top - it's a wonder any scenery was left after this bunch got through chewing it. With the exception of Mr. O'Toole and Ms. Christie (both alumni of David Lean directed epic films and both of whom had very brief moments of dialogue/monologue), the other actors could have used a circus ringmaster to keep them in line.To use the most improper English I can - ""Troy"" ain't no ""Lawrence Of Arabia"" and Wolfgang Petersen t'ain't no David Lean!"
1,pretty bad,Jennifer Anison's and Colin Ferrell's worst role to date. Digusting and foul. Don't waste your time or money. Pitiful excuse for a movie.
1,Not as good as expected from Weller,"It has the same problem all piezo lighters have, the striker goes out after a short time. I suppose if you used it once a month it would last a long time, I use mine many times a day."
1,tatoly dezaponted,"I fought this cdd was goinna roack simplee becauz this band is got the ferst word spelled wrong... its lookes koolr lake thet do not't get me wroung... Linkin lakes so much better than Lincoln... the ""L"" doesnt even make noise... I meen come oun... thats just stopid... Lincoln is dumb... but anyway I think the L should be taken out... but Linkin Park was a godly bend until Chester turned into the bad side of musik hestoree.... thank about it... he just isnt that grey... he looks more green to me."
1,Room for improvement,"I feel like I need a magnifying glass to read this dictionary. I appreciate the fact that it has thousands of useful words, but could we make the font just a little larger. Also, it would be nice to have indented letter tabs for quick reference since there are so many words. I feel like it takes forever to just find the letter..."
1,ditto on the 'big disappointment',I agree that the fictional character in the book (Sam Constant) distracts from any revelation or insight into criminology.
1,Second edition of an entertaining and informative book,"This book appeared first in 1996 under the title ""Witch Doctor of Wall Street"" and it turns out to be exactly the same book with an ""epilogue"" added yet neither the book nor the advertising suggest this. The book forms the basis of Professor Parks' course in Capital Markets and Investment at Pace University. The tone of the book is critical and curmudgeonly yet some interesting points are made and it makes a useful accompaniment to the standard finance text book (Sharpe, Brealy & Meyers, etc.). The first edition was full of misprints and errors which, I hope, have been corrected in this second edition."
1,Not a good representation of LGBT NY,"This film is not a good representative of LGBT New York. NYC is very diverse. This film is not. I would have liked this film a lot better if I felt it was realistic. New York is nearly 70% ethnic, of very diverse backgrounds. This film is not diverse at all. Even the extras are not ethnic. It's too bad that filmmakers don't pay attention to their demographics, or choose to deny the reality. Part of the experience from film is to feel it's realistic and this one failed miserably."
1,defective,product does not work at all. Changed with brand new batteries just to make sure...and nothing. It is difficult to write at least 20 words when a produce you purchase....does not work at all.
1,Don't Buy this card!!!,"Repeated savings over files on this card lead to the games being corrupted. I've only had this card for two weeks now and i've had five save files go corrupt. Having to restart ffx when you're almost to the end is a real pain and i'm very disappointed in this card. If you can't find a sony card, buy one of the other 3rd party cards, this should be a last resort!!!"
1,Doesn't last,Works great while the controller lasted. I bought two and the first one died after a couple of months then the second controller died a few months later.
1,kinda expected more,"Kinda expected more from this...... our 9 year old didn't even like it. The accents made it hard to follow a weak/boring plot. We've watched a lot of animated movies in the past 6 years, usually multiple times ;-) this one gotta say not again."
1,weird taste...like lemony artificial sweetener,"The texture of this is beautiful...the taste is, frankly, yucky. At first I thought it tasted a little like artificial lemon flavoring rather than ""cheesecake"" but then the aftertaste is really unpleasant very artificial. Bummer."
1,crap,Blue Tarp had a hole in the middle plugged by some yellow putty substance; wasn't worth the effort of returning the item.
1,A second rate collection of horror fragments.,"The characters in every story are just about the same; dirt poor teenage-young adult southern goth musicians, complete with homosexual lovers and no place to go. Some die, some don't, but who really cares. The couple things I did enjoy out of Wormwood were grizzly death scenes and well established, disturbing settings. A little black humor here and there at least contributed something towards overall enjoyment, but no enough. Variety would have helped out considerably, as would plots. Brite isn't a terrible writer, but dosen't do anything her pal Caitlin R. Kiernan couldn't do a hell of a lot better."
1,The lock itself is not bad just the way of changing the combo,The problem I have with this is not the lock itself but how you change the combo. I had one I was changing the combo on and I apparently let the key slip during the change when I tried the lock the combo I thought I had set did not work and there is no recovering from that. I have been using the Sesame lock which came out before this. It's damn near impossible for that to happen on that lock as you stick a pin in a hole not a key in a keyhole held in place by friction. The key can shift and mess up the process not so with the original. SO I have bought my last Master Lock knock off of the one that works. OH for the critic out there I did not buy them on Amazon but from Lowes.
1,The worst album this year,"I liked Mindy's work since the beginning with ""Ten Thousand Angels"" You would expect an artist to get better with each new album. This is not the case with Mindy McCready. I have tried listening to CD over and over and can not get into it. I don't understand how she pick such awful songs. Her voice is gorgeous and should be used on better songs."
1,Why Can't The Students Do Anything right?,"It seems that Jeremy Silman's students can't do ANYTHING right. No matter what they do, it is wrong. Maybe that says something about Silman as a teacher."
1,Can not use it,I could NOT install it as it did not fit. User's manual tells you to go get an adapter from a plumber. Eh...

1,Junk,"Are you kidding I know it's only a few bucks but the extreamly poor quality is beyond what I would call cheap! Tried to mount the damn thing with the screws they provided -- Ha, all 4 snapped in half when trying to screw them in, I even drilled pilot holes. Honestly I am getting really tired of the ""Made in China"" thing. Can't these companies spend a penny per 10,000 screws and get something a little better than diecast.I give this company a -1 on a whole for quality!!! I will never buy another one of their products. I could do a better job with tinfoil and duct tape."
1,The WORST user experience ever,"This is the single hardest to use appliance I have ever purchased. The controls and alarm set are cryptic at best. You'd think since I have a Master's in Human Factors I could figure this thing out, but it's just terrible. I plan on smashing it as soon as I buy a new one.In additon, the display is so bright you have to turn the clock away to sleep.Look elsewere folk, because this think is bad."
1,If your buying a lawnmower don't buy this one.,"If your thinking of buying a new lawnmower I would suggest you save your money and don't buy this one. If you like to cut your grass early in the morning when the grass is even a little wet you will have nothing but problems, all that will happen is that the grass will stick to the side of the lawnmower and plug the exit shoot.If you want to multch don't even think about doing it with this lawnmower, there is barely enough power to cut the grass never mind multch."
1,Tough stuff!,"I'm no yoga beginner, I've been doing it for a few years, and Crunch's first yoga tape (The Joy of Yoga) is still one of my favorites, I love the style and the instructor (who also does this video too). This tape is only recommended for those who are advanced in their yoga practice or just naturally very flexible. I did make it through the whole tape, but I was miserable for the next two days, my back and hips were killing me. This is probably a good tape for the advanced, but if you're a beginner, leave this one alone, there are better ones to start with that will help you to stick with yoga."
1,ILL!,"What's this? The BSB singing in Italian?!? Now I've seen EVERYTHING! I've heard the Italian version, in this case, of Quit Playing Games With My Heart, and it doesn't sound like them AT ALL."
1,"McCandless is a strange, strange man.","Jon Krakauer's book Into the Wild is a wonderous story about a mans ability to do what ever his heart desires. The main character Chris McCandless was an adventurer that too often didn't think before his actions, he went on impulse, whick lead to his death in the wilderness north of Mt. McKinley. Krakauer's writing and organization in this book was confusing. It is very jumppy and hard which made it hard to keep interest. The book was not only about the McCandless story but what type of person Krakauer thought him to be. McCadless was definately had a screwed up head. Why in the world would anyone throw away all their money, and roam the world. What is even weirder is that he thought that what he did was noble in his own sence. Krakauer points out some instences in his childhood that could have contributed to his mental state. McCadless was mentally deranged to do what he did. He should have done more smart planning."
1,S-9888 safety fuse purchased from Amazon,"This item arrived timely but, I had a problem. To install this item I very carefully turned it backwards until it clicked into the threads properly. Then I turned it in about one turn with my fingers when it stopped. I thought it was an NPT thread, so I put a wrench on it. Before it penetrated the lid fully, it became very difficult to turn. Thinking there was something wrong, I backed it out and discovered the aluminum threads of the pressure cooker lid stuck tightly in the threads of the fuse. Now I'm not certain if the fuse threads were different than those in the cooker lid or, if after being as careful as I was, I somehow got the fuse cross threaded."
1,Not for iWork 8,"Keynote 2 for Mac OS X (Visual QuickStart Guide)I guess I was expecting info on the latest version of Keynote. Under chapter 1, ""Installing Kenote"". It says Installing ""iWork 5"". Too bad it doesn't say somewhere in the description that it's for iWork 05, not iWork 08. I'm sure it will give me a good start anyway."
2,questioning the nature of matter,"We are scientistically smug about the nature of the ""inanimate world."" We KNOW all about matter/energy, and KNOW that it is just a matter of time before the natural sciences, the disciplines dealing with the inert world, can explain the up-to-now mysterious leap from neurobiology to awareness. Read this excellent book to find out that an alternative view has been available all along--for at least 2500 years in Western thought-- and that it is a credible, interesting, generative option that many major thinkers, old and new, have seriously promulgated."
2,Great value,This is a great value w/ decent quality accessories. Definitely better than paying 20 bucks a piece for each thing. Don't really use the ear bud though.
2,Great Birthday Gift!!,"I got a pair of fun slides for my nephew's birthday. He is 7 years old. He wasn't really excited at first, because he had never seen a pair of funslides before. However, I was told that he and his younger brother, ag 5, both quickly fell in love with them. In fact I plan to get my younger nephew his own pair when his birthday rolls around."
2,I can finally use a GPS unit!,"I think I have owned two GPS units in the past...but, needed a new one to help navigate the backcountry while snowmachining here in Alaska. After purchasing the Topo map series, learning how to save the maps to my unit via the flash card, I am so in love with this unit. Once you install the Topo map software, you will need to update from Garmin and then you can export your routes in a variety of forms; i.e. pdf for email sharing, file extension .gpx for other users and to layer over Google Earth. Great unit and package!"
2,"Sweet, escapist and vaguely romantic","Slow News Day is about escapism, but does so in a graceful way. Katherine is a San Francisco native, doing an internship in Wheatstone, England (as rural and remote as it may sound). Ostensibly there to learn a bit about small-town journalism, Katherine is also doing some sneaky research for a sitcom she's writing.Slow News Day smells of romantic wish-fulfillment: Katherine manages to be successful at everything she does (journalism, television writing, a weekly column for the Times...) except for romance. And even that comes eventually. Slow News Day, however, does this in a less painfully self-conscious way. Andi Watson is telling a good, self-contained story with amusing, empathetic characters. The art - although not packed with detail - is an interesting, indicative style that helps keep things moving at a good pace."
2,"Mystery, Romance, and Satisfaction","Could Dark Desire live up to the first book of the series..Dark Prince. Could it be possible? A resounding YES! is heard. Ms. Feehan made the perfect sequel. This tale is full of all the ingredients that make a novel stand out. Not least of all a scrumptuous leading male character, Jacques. How can she keep pulling these great books out of her sleeve? I don't know but i can't wait for more!"
2,this is a classic.,"This album is a classic. The pixies changed musicians view of music forever. They have inspired many modern day bands. This is the most famous of their albums, mostly because it contains the popular ""here comes your man"". If you have never heard the pixies before, you will be very surprised. They are incredibly unique and seem to be able to create the most amazing sounds which will make you go ""I didnt know a guitair could do that"".Their is a strong punk influence here as well as some other strong 70s influences, like David Bowie. 15 years after it's original release and it still sounds fresh, if you like grunge, you'll probably like the pixies, they were a sort of ""pre-grunge"" band.The pixies was the high point in both black francis' (now frank black) and kim deal's (of the breeders) career and neither have them has since topped it and probably never will. If you are a fan of the breeders or frank black, you will love this CD."
2,"Essential, If Not Complete","""10 More Actual, Official LSAT Preptests"" is absolutely essential to studying for the big exam. I've been working with Arco and Kaplan's books, which both feature sample tests and some exercises. However, they're inadequate in preparing you for the nature of the real test questions. ""10 More...Preptests,"" being actual LSATs, actually do give you a feel for the test's real questions.The only complaint I have is that there is no explanation key but it's a minor complaint, since I have had to look over my answers and figure out for myself why my answers were wrong. Of course, this helps, as it forces you to examine the questions more thoroughly than you normally would.My recommendation is to use this book in conjunction with a study guide (Kaplan has a good one). Study the test-taking techniques and do the exercises in the study guide, THEN test your skills with this book."
2,"Absolutely brilliant, but...","-Okay, while i absolutely adore Justine Waddell as an actor, and especially in this movie, i cannot help but think while reading these reviews that the other actors in this wonderful movie are being dismissed rather undeservingly. yes, Justine Waddell is perfect as Tess, but what of Oliver Milburn who was brilliant as Angel Clare or Jason Flemyng who was also great as Alec? The performances those two turned in at least warrant a mention, i think, so there it is. Okay, so far this has been more rave than review, but here it goes... This movie was a brilliant and sparkling portrayal of Hardy's classic. The scenes, especially those between Angel and Tess are played in a vein Hardy would have been proud of, and although i agree Jason Flemyng makes Alec rather too likeable all other changes and/or ommissions in the plot never detract from the enjoyability of the story. All in all a decidedly worthwhile film."
2,A Good Game,The most realistic pinball released for the Game Boy Advance up to now. I really like the different tables and it plays just like an arcade version.
2,Powerful and Romantic,"Wonderful period drama/romance. It reminded me of Far From the Madding Crowd mixed with a dash of Pride & Prejudice - all set in rural early 20th Century Ireland. Mossie Sheehan is every inch the devoted Gabriel Oak; and when he hunts down and returns the silly step-daughter who has run off with a lover, it's reminiscent of Darcy's search and delivery of Lydia. That said, it isn't a five-star series. The wigs are horrific. Elizabeth settles a little too easily and quickly into the role of mother (particularly to another woman's children) and adjusts a little too happily into rural life for a woman who was raised in the city as solicitor's daughter. But all faults are forgiven on my part when Mossie Sheehan declares his love - twice (sort of). My knees buckled and I had to get a drink of water to recover my senses. All in all, the most romantic series I've seen in a long while (not counting Gaskell's incomparable North & South). You won't be disappointed."
2,Conception of Ideas,Good material for the avid writer or the devoted Harry Potter fan who can't get enough background research on J.K. Rowling.
2,Great Movie,"Takes place in France. Two college students are going to study for school in one of the girl's home. The first night a strange car drives to the house and kills the whole, abducting one of the girls. The second girls chases after her friend and tries to figure out a way to save her.Withou giving out the whole story, this movie makes you think things that aren't really what you think that it is. Killing scenes are really good! Must see!"
2,NEW BODY,"This is a continuation (part 2) of New Body! Pilates . This is for the intermediate level. The menu choices are: the mat workout (36 mins.) and the sculpting series (9 mins). Equipment used were a mat and very lightweight dumbbells. Jennifer continues with the mat workout for the intermediate level in which the pace is a bit quicker, but she explains and directs each movement to give the viewer a better understanding of the Pilates method. The second workout uses (or without) very lightweight dumbbells (1-2 lbs) and exercises are done standing. Very simple, short reps of arm exercises."
2,"Great, roomy pack","Bought this as a Christmas gift for my parents and they love it! Very good quality, and the perfect size for 2 people."
2,Easily one of their best CDs EVER,"I never understood why this CD got overlooked and everybody raves about ""Destroyer"", which is a good CD but not nearly as dead on as this CD. Since Ace is on the cover, it would have been interesting to see how different this CD might have been if Ace actuallhy PLAYED on it. Best songs: ""Saint & Sinner"", ""War Machine"", ""Danger"" ""I Love It Loud"" & ""Creatures Of The Night"" The only clunker is ""Keep Me Comin'"""
2,This is the best book for kosher & non-kosher cooks alike,"There are a wide variety of dishes in this book. They range from empanadas to stir fry to couscous with the traditional (matzah balls, cholent, etc.) thrown in for good measure. The instructions are clear. Even a new bride can manage making exotic creations. For the observant or newly-observant, Jewish law is included to help the process of meal creation for every day, Shabbat, Festivals or other occasions (your in-laws first dinner at your house or the boss coming home for example). I have the Settlement Cookbook, Joy of Cooking and many other classics but, this one is the best. I love this book!!!!!!!"
2,Decent for the Price,"I've had the t-shirt/sweatshirt combination for a couple of months, and they are holding up well to use. The sweatshirt appears to be good weight, but the t-shirt is a little light.I would buy these again."
2,Uppity women unite!,"First, it's great blues. Second, it's great that it's women singing/playing the blues. Third it's great for ""middle-aged"" women; women breaking up/divorcing and feeling their oats; married women tired of the daily grind... OK you're getting the picture."
2,Well made. Excellent value.,This chair is well made with good attention to detail. It rolls easily and can be maneuvered by a smaller person. Seat is comfortable.
2,No big surprise here. I KNEW this CD would ROCK!!!,"After I heard Flaming Pie, I knew Paul was heading back into a different musical direction. His music has made a drastic change, and a change for the better. Now, after more than 30 years after the Beatles, Paul is back to do the music he became famous for. This is why I was not surprised of the quality of Run Devil Run. Paul, like the Beatles once did with covers, reinvents songs like Blue Jean Bop, Shake a Hand, I Got Stung, and the rocking She Said Yeah. I am just looking forward to his next album. Remember, he did say this is a good place to start.Note, my review would actually be 4 1/2."
2,Most helpful,"This book is most helpful when starting out and you need guidance on understanding this deck of cards, the layout of book is easy to follow and understand."
2,Top notch,"Amon at his best, absolutely stonkin, great mix of heavy bass warped jazz and electronic fusion, mixed with more jazzy downtemp numbers, huge track is sordid, big nasty bass. Love it (i own all his albums, and am awaiting the delivery of my foley room CD)"
2,Pretty good - though flavor not all I had hoped,"These are, like all LaraBars, flavorful, filling, and made of simple ingredients. The flavor wasn't all I'd hoped, given some of the reviews - they're cherry pie LaraBars with chopped peanuts added - a little peanut taste as you bite into them, and a peanut aftertaste. What I loved about peanut butter sandwiches was the way the richness of the peanut butter contrasted with the fruitiness of the jelly.These bars don't do it for me, since they lack the rich peanut butter taste I love. However, they're not at all bad in themselves (just not so good that they'd make my favorites list, where apple pie remains at the top, though I've never tried a LaraBar I really didn't like)."
2,How much we miss,"Normally we build our library on the classics and the buy another version, and another.That is fine, it allows you to compare lectures and is very interesting.On the down side we miss music like the one in this CD. It is a jewel. Sometimes is difficult to remember that you are hearing Respighi.The perfomance and recording are first rate, after hearing it 3 times in one day, it still grows.Get it!"
2,Wonderful (Maravilloso),I have read other reviews and they all indicate that John is not CCR. Boys .... enjoy what there is no more. Talented people and that vibrates with the Rock 'N Roll like Fogerty are few. CCR already. We left him with a super live sound refined and blowing people out of their seats.A great CD. Possibly one of the best I've heard recorded live.
2,Love it!,"I really like this product, is fragance and oil free so is really good for the skin, and the color was just the same of my skin so every time I wear it have a natural look that I just love. I use it with foundation before it, so I dont know if it does work as good without foundation. 5 stars"
2,Better Than the First,"I actually thought this one was better than the first EGs book, simply because it was less over the top as far as outlandish life instructions (I mean really, who is going to buy a classic Jaguar convertible for their road trip to the Grand Canyon?) but definitely relevant today. I too am sick to death of annoying song cell phone rings. And many people have not figured out how to be polite with a cell phone to begin with. Definitely still has signature EG wit and humor."
2,It's alright...,"Since I'm more of a pessimistic person,The cons.. (at least with mine)-The speakers will fade out. Sometimes one side doesn't work or then the other side doesn't work. Then it'll turn on and blast me with volume all of the sudden.-After a year of owning it the keyboard started having weird problems. It needed replaced but the warantee was already up.-As some have stated before it does go really slow because it doesn't have a lot of memory...The pros...-I can watch a whole movie and a half with the battery. :)-Burns cds nicelyOverall, it's a good little computer and the problems I had might just be mine and you wouldn't experience them at all. Guess whenever you buy something man-made you have to gamble a little bit. :)"
2,RHCP Maturation,"It is important for all the hardcore 1980's fans to know that the red hot chili peppers needed to change once slovak died. When John came, they overtook a much more mellow sound. It is almost as if they are a different band using the same name. But, when people say there is nothing of their old roots in this album, just listen to Can't Sop and By The Way. Both of these songs are NON-BALLADS, and both contain the rap rock element of their past. The reason why i give this four stars is that I DO agree with past reviewers saying that Anthony tries to rhyme far to many lines. There needs to be more funk as well. But there are still memorable songs on this album."
2,Anchovite Delight!,"When it comes to anchovies, it is worth the few extra cents to buy Crown Prince. They are consistently dependable in flavor and never mushy.Buying them by case at Amazon saves frustration at the store when they are out of stock and only carry an inferior brand. Crown Prince delivers to even the pickiest anchovite and Amazon delivers in product, price and service."
2,still deciding,This is a good night cream and is not greasy or heavy at all. Would like to use more of it before deciding if it's making any difference. However I do like it and will continue to use it. I have used the Robanda products before and like the ingredients that they contain. Good so far and will need more time to evaluate any difference in skin.
2,great for an occasion,i love that it came in a pack of 5 worked perfectly to get monogrammed for a friends first CD release. the top sticks a little the first few times you screw/unscrew it but its really fine other than that.
2,Retro keyboard adventure!,"Former beastie boy keyboard player money mark (mark ramos nishta), brings more than just bits and pieces of keyboard and guitar rifs to his second album,push the button envokes a blur of emotions and retro senses. Money mark prooves once again that he is truely the master of moog."
2,Ubuntu 6.10 (64-bit PC Edition),I needed it for my new computer. It loaded up like a champ and has been working well ever since.
2,Rockport Mens World Tour Classic Walking Shoes... GREAT!!,"This is the third pair of Rockport Mens World Tour Classic Walking Shoes that I have purchased, purely because I find them the most comfortable shoes for travelling and their looks allow for daily casual tramping as well as looking formal for evening wear. Will keep buying these shoes whilst they are available."
2,A classic for men and women,"Norwood offers uncommon insight into why people develop unhealthy thinking and behavior patterns within relationships. Equally interesting are the stories of people who may alternately develop intense and unhealthy attachments to food, sex, alcohol, work, shopping, or any other external ""thing"" as a way to relieve deep emotional pain. If that sounds like you or someone you know, it's likely you will find comfort in this book. Solid guidance and concrete steps for those who are ready to move beyond these behaviors to a more healthy way of life - or support someone else who makes such a choice."
2,an emensely thrilling horror flick,"This movie is definitly one of the best B-movie horror flicks of all time. 5 friends in a lonely cabin in the middle of nowhere, what better scenario for a blood and guts classic. the bottom line is that this movie is GREAT, a must see. If you like it you should also check out the sequel Evil Dead 2 and Army of Darkness."
2,"Some problems, but overall great.","I have a love-hate relationship with this book. It is very useful in editing, others and your own writing, but there is one main thing I hate about this book.As I have read other books (including HARRY POTTER, classics such as THE THREE MUSKETEERS) I have noticed that whoever worked on those books plainly did not read SELF-EDITING FOR FICTION WRITERS. They break all the rules of the book. And if some of the best books break the rules, why should everyone else follow those rules? It bugs me, because I've read and loved those books, and now I don't get to enjoy them as much because I see what's wrong about them. But I never noticied it before.So if these things need to be followed to get published, why are there so many books out there that don't follow them?On the other hand, a lot of things in this book are relavent and are useful when editing and writing, and for those that can forgive the above mentioned problem, it's a great book."
2,"My 5-, 4-, and 1-year old LOVE these videos!","I got these because my 5-year old is improving his reading, my 4-year-old still needs to master his letters, and my 1-year old can always use a head start. Within a week or two, my 4-year-old is saying ""C, like C-C-Cold!"" I also wondered how to introduce the simple math, and Math Circus is awesome. I totally recommend these for just about any age (my 10-year-old nephew is also entertained by them), and they're well worth the price!"
2,Tasty Nutriton,"Having bounced around a few times between this and EASs Whey protein powder products,I give a nod to Gold Standard. Its lower cholesterol content combined with less sugars, tips the scale, at least for me. I do have to pay attention to my cholesterol levels; despite what some would have you believe, dietary cholesterol intake does influence those levels (it's not simply related to saturated fats in many cases). That said, EAS's chocolate flavored whey protein powder has a slightly sweeter chocolate taste, something I actually prefer, but overall, Gold Standard's the product I consume most often."
2,*N Sync: All Grown Up?,"In the land of boy bands and pop music, *N Sync is red hot. And with their new cd, ""Celebrity,"" they show no signs of stopping. I have respect for all types of music, but I am not a paticular fan of pop. But I was shocked and amazed on hearing ""Celebrity"". This cd ranges from pop to R&B to hip-hop to borderline techno. These guys have a new found attitude - this cd is wonderfully lacking the lovesick whiny ballads, in exchange for rhythm and blues. And with Justin and JC writing 10 out of the 13 tracks on the CD, I have found an all new respect for these boys. I recommend this cd to those who love pop, and even to those who hate it. You may just change your mind."
2,Great time and gas saving but more update needs,"The device has my satisfaction with its 80% accuracy of the acquisition. It is employed to lead out of the maze. There are times that it made the ways to obsolete or non-existence places, but like every thing in life, there is always room for improvement.For that: (1) detour from the route only works when it is on the route, not before, so user has to be actually on the non-desired route before it can guide to the alternatives, (2) non-existence places need to be updated, (3)the GPS car holder is too stiff, hard to pull the device out without breaking the adhesive that hold the holder to the dash board, (4) the car charger cable when charging the device makes it very fragile to break, here the device is supposed to be used daily so more stable and robustness should be factored in the design.Other than these, it is good to let the 350 be a guidance with human sense."
2,Works great and cheap,"There really isnt much to say about this product, it does what its supposed to do and at a great price. I got it a few days after ordering it, pulled it out its box, then removed it from its plastic bag and attached it to a hdmi cable. I hooked it up to my video card and then to my tv and it worked perfectly. Great product at an awesome price"
2,The reference guide that never fails to impress,"I purchased this Item for myself as my older copy was 10 yrs old and looking a little tired and worn. I gift this book to friends also as its an amazing reference guide, that has it all. I love this book and use it as the basic guide to expand my knowledge of the mineral kingdom, and to truly appreciate what these gifts from the earth can help, heal and communicate to us. WOW... This IS a ""MUST HAVE"" in my collection and should be in yours too. Highly recommended."
2,2 out of 2 ain't bad,"I stumbled over Rahsaan Patterson's first album a couple of years ago when I thought the cover looked interesting. I was rewarded with a great honest r'n'b album and eagerly awaited his follow-up. It doesn't disappoint. While it doesn't have any of the fantastic string arrangements that were a highlight of the first album, it's probably a bit tighter and funkier overall. And while it is steeped in traditional r'n'b, the album avoids an obvious retro feel. Here's an album full of strong songs, well played and well sung. Unfortunately that's not what's fashionable in what passes for r'n'b these days and that, coupled with his record company's apparent unwillingness to promote him, means that Rahsaan Patterson doesn't sell anywhere near the numbers he deserves to."
2,good job,"i like this album a lot, but i still think evol is the better choice...it is a more ""mellow"" albumm than evol. well anyway get both of them. the trilogy is awesome!"
2,Weigh Me,"Overall a good digital scale.Pros:sleek, good looking, will fit any decor and weigh-ins fairly accurate.Cons/Watch out for:make sure you use scale on smooth leveled surfaces or your weigh-ins will certainly be off."
2,"Great band, buy the album!","I saw Antelope play in Atlanta a few months ago, and was very impressed. If you like your music loop-heavy, minimal and artfully arranged, I'd heavily recommend that you check out this record. The end."
2,one of the better contemporary rock bands,janes addiction have something that not too many bands out there today have. Good writing good vocal performance and good guitar playing.Dave navarro plays some mighty fine licks that are reminiscent of Led Zepplin along with perry farrell's vocal treatment. their writing is poetic and thoughtful. They rock hard but with taste and true talent
2,My son really loves it,"I gave a lower rating for durability because ours always seems to get stuck in the numbers,colors position even when the page is turned to the music side. My 8 month old doesn't seem to care. He loves to flip the page back and forth and it has more stability for him to stand against than his other toys. Overall, I am happy with it and don't regret spending the money on it."
2,Works great!,"We got these headphones for our 2 year old son and they work great! On a long plane ride, we just plug them into our iPod Touch and let him watch cartoons. They were just the right size for his toddler-sized head."
2,Great.,Great show! Always a twist at the end i didn't see coming! Look forward to buying the next seasons.
2,better than stuntman,after playing stuntman and withstanding the torture of my... purchase i was relieved that Chase was not another such mistake. I thouroughly enjoyed the game as it has a much better stunt system than Stuntman aswell as loading times that werent as annoying. If you like arcade driving games and want something different then your average racing game then I highly recommend Chase.
2,A lot of fun,Single player was ok. It was the online multiplayer that allowed you to blow holes through walls and create new entrances that was awesome!
2,So far it's been OK.,"This USB to PS/2 converter allows me to use my old KVM switch. It turned out that the model I ordered had been replaced by a new model. The delivery company emailed me to make sure that I was OK with receiving the new model before they shipped it to me. Very good customer service. So far everything has been great with one exception. This device seems to have a little trouble in a KVM environment. It will occasionally (once every few days) lose connectivity when plugged into my laptop's docking station, which is connected to my KVM switch. The USB port stops recognizing the device for some reason. However, if I plug the device directly into my laptop, it works consistently, without any issues. Would I buy this item again, sure. For the price, the occasional inconvenience can be tolerated."
2,I actually liked this movie,A lot of people seem to think it's a dumb movie but I liked it. It had a few cute references to the original. The graphics are pretty impressive and the cast is brilliant.
2,Oldie but Goody,"I read this book when it was first released in 1972, and recently reread it. In my opinion, it help up well over the last 40 years."
2,Randolph Scott movies,Always enjoy Randolph Scott movies. These are terrific. Highly watchable. No extreme violence as in more modern films. These are relaxed evening types.
2,good support,"Bought this for my elderly dad, and it's quite supportive and soft on his bones. He usually can't sit on a regular wood chair without it hurting him, and this cushion solves all the problems, plus it makes the seat taller and therefore easier for him to get up"
2,The Best,This CD is a must have if you are a jazz lover like me. The precision of this group is so amazing that sometimes you even think that you are listening to one trombone. They harmonize so nicely. If you like jazz then buy this CD right now.
2,Warm and Comforting,"My son, who has Aspergers, feels very safe with this blanket on him. It is very, very soft, comfortable, and the perfect size for a twin bed.The picture of the praying hands is just like you see in the picture.I recommend this product for its comfort and quality."
2,One for the Money,"One for the Money takes place in the ""burg"" located n New Jersey. The main character, Stephanie Plum, is in trouble with debt when her car gets impounded because she has been lacking on her payments. She starts to get cut off from the world when she doesn't pay her bills and she loses her phone and she almost loses her electricity. She ends up buying a car with a microwave and some other appliances. It is a truly fun book to read. She takes a jog from her cousin and becomes a bounty hunter. She will get $10,000 if she catches someone but that someone is an ex-cop and the book has some weird twists. Read it NOW!!!"
2,Do I really have to put a title?,"I'm satisfied with it. I needed a steering wheel cover(obviously), because the steering wheel in my truck was starting to wear, & this was perfect for the job. The delivery time was great, & (as the instructions say) after letting it warm up in the sun for a bit was fairly easy to install (it's really difficult though if you just try to slap it on right when you get it).There is one small complaint I have about it, but it's more the design of my steering wheel than the product itself."
2,Great product! Great value!,"My daughter got the DS Lite from Mr. HO HO for Christmas. She is 11 and I was worried that it might be too ""young"" in comparison to the PSP, which my 9 yr. old had requested. She was very happy with the game selections and played it all day on Christmas, and required me to ""wean"" her in the days following. It has been flawless and half the price of Sony's competing system"
2,One Of Greatest Of 1990s...,"Along with Aimee Mann's solo debut Whatever, this is my favorite album of the 1990s. Great magery, especially in the title track. A must have for any MCC fan."
2,Hatchico,An easy read but a little short. Would make a great read-along story for kids! Now I want to see the movie.
2,nice book,I think its more for an older child than 7 but will see how it goes. Maybe a book to share with Mom.
2,Blood Test Kit Worked Great!!,"One kit contains two tests. I ordered two kits, so four of us tested our blood. It was painless, clean, saved the time and expense of going to the doctor, and fun to do it yourself!!Would highly recommend this product."
2,very user friendly,The rubberized bottom and comfortable handle on this bowl make it a pleasure to use. It is light in weight and easy to clean.
2,great classic,"I have enjoyed this movie over the years whenever I catch on TV, so I finally bought it. It's just one of those you like to pop in on a rainy day and curl up with your cat to watch. The story line is good, the actors are great. I love the transformation in Shirley MacLaine from headstrong actress to selfless Geisha. Movie is nicely done. Basic DVD, no extras, No documentation in the case, just a DVD. I miss the little pamphlets and pictures they used to put in them. Pop some popcorn and ENJOY the movie though!"
2,Great Value for Long Level,"I am a remodeling contractor and needed an accurate long level for hanging doors and framing walls. My other levels are all Johnson's and they have been accurate and trouble free. Would prefer to have a magnetic edge like my partner's Stabila level, but for the money I can't complain."
2,This ribbon will give you a place in life,"I never thought my life amounted to anything. I thought I was totally insignificant in this world, driving myself to ending my life and stop being a burden on everyone else so they can get on with their lives without dragging me down.Until I got this ribbon. Then I realized life wasn't so bad."
2,Highly recommended!,"I just got this cooler, and since I had been running my notebook for 5 days straight, I plugged it in as soon as I got it. Simply put, VERY quick cooling, light, and quiet. There are no warm spots across the board. I do admit the power plug on the cooler does come off a bit too easily, but I don't carry the cooler around anyways, and I'm carrying my notebook around my house. Well designed and fits perfectly with my 13-inch notebook. When mounted, it will give you an elevation of just uder an inch, and produces adequate airflow underneath the notebook. Plus, it has a neat little blue LED light on the fan speed selection switch. I will point out that my notebook is relatively thin, thus making the cooler work better, so if your notebook ranges to about 1 inch thick, this is definately your choice."
2,It looks great,"I don't cook, but i set this on my stove and it looks neat. and yes, i know i am an idiot."
2,Inconfundible,"This album is right there with ""A Pesar de Todo"" as Victor's best. The album brings some new sounds and ideas to the music but keeps with the basic style of the previous two productions. This is simply just awesome music that is great to listen and dance to. It's the great music we've grown accustomed to from Victor Manuelle and is an album that anyone who likes salsa should consider buying."
2,Not a problem here,"Over Christmas I drove cross country and this device worked the entire way with the same station the whole way to and around L.A. (the default station). As long as your ipod is in a secure spot that doesn't move around a lot, I found the reception and sound quality to be great. There were a few times when I did have to move the ipod around a little and then the reception would work well."
2,My 2nd favorite RTS Game,"When i first played Age of empires i knew the 2nd one would be a hell of alot better than the first. It was so much better. The resolution was better, the castle age and imperial age are an excellent add on.(The dark age and fudel are just like the ones in age of empires 1.) The new weapons, buildings, castles are my favorite. This game has no end to the limits. Multiplayer is so much fun except when there is lag. This game deserves to be honored with 4 stars because of its authentic gameplay."
2,A Must For Every Married or Hoped to Be Married Couple,"When my husband and I viewed these video's I know it's redundant to say, but it was life changing! Light bulbs kept going off with both of us. We said, ""if only"" we had known this years ago. But today is a new day and His mercies are new and fresh every morning and Great is His faithfulness. We look forward to spending our retirement with these principles more and more firmly entrenched in our lives. Thank you Emerson and Sarah for sharing these God given time held truths to that s generation that so desperately needs it."
2,Eternal Rain Fountain,"I LOVE IT! I bought 2 and I am glad I did because the first one developed mineral deposits in the rain spout holes. After some brisk cleaning, it was just like new. I have one at work and one at home. Every kid at school asks me if it is ""real rain""!"
2,tight cut,happy birthday to one of the baddest musicians to ever do it. his grooves and vamps alone leave a lasting impact on the human ear drum. dug his build up and arrangements. the extra feel of tribal drums and counter rhythms are something else to the soul and ear.
2,VERY NICE RING!!,THIS RING LOOK JUST LIKE IT DID IN THE PICTURE!I AM VERY GLAD TO HAVE THIS RING.IT WEARS AND FITS VERY GOOD ! I WILL BUY FROM THIS SELLER AGAIN!
2,BUY IT NOW!!!,"I underestimated the power of this game....I thought it was going to be just another dull movie game....I was wrong...The force corrected me. Have you ever tried to imagine what a Jedi Battle will look like?....this game will take you right in the middle of a Jedi battle, lightsabers and FORCE powers included. Awesome movie like graphics and details. Plus several of the best gaming moments of your life!!! It is a bit long and Quake2 style but gradually you as you start mastering the Force it will deliver pure gamong pleasure!!! I will not spoil the surprises on all the cool stuff you get to blow up, throw, pull, and so on!! great FPS and TPS too. Multiplayer action is great as well!...Just buy it, my young Padawan learner!!!....."
2,Dream Healer,A fascinating book. This slow reader couldnt put it down! I read it in 1/2 a day. A Must to read.
2,It has changed my life,What a look at the three persons in the parable and how we are all of them! I have never experienced a book that so magnificently gave me the message of being God's Beloved and being welcomed into His light and home. Nouwen's images are powerful as usual.
2,Prettiest cookie jar ever,I bought this handbag cookie jar for my mother and she loved it. It is very different and everyone admires it.
2,So happy!!,"I fell in love with Lyle when I was a kid, and this one and ""Lyle, Lyle Crocodile"" are still my favorites. I was so happy to find these books again! I hope ""The House on East 88th Street"" will be available on DVD one day very soon. I highly recommend these feel-good stories for any child or nostalgic adult."
2,"For fans of ska, punk, reggae, and swing. Great CD!","I really love this cd, even though I've only had it a few days(it's so new), but I can already tell I'm gonna be listening to it for a long time. The songs are fast paced. The horns and guitar sound very good. Great ska band, you get a good 55 minutes. I definitely recommend this cd. Like my title says and like the cd says on it, for fans of ska, punk, reggae, and swing."
2,3 out of 4 ain't bad,"When the box set arrived, I didn't even bother taking ""Kingdom of the Crtstal Skul"" out of its plastic. Straight to the Goodwill box went that piece I garbage. With that chore done, I was free to enjoy Indiana Jones in all of its original trilogy glory. I'm happy to have the three originals on BluRay. This would have been a five star review if the fourt ""film"" had not been included."
2,The Wii is fun for everyone.,"Most of my friends and I are not ""gamers,"" but we've all been able to find something fun about the Wii. That what I like about it so much, I'm not wasting my time trying to memorize which buttons do what, I just just play some fun games. It's quite intuitive."
2,"""Hugga Bunch"" -- Excellent kid video!","This movie is absolutely fabulous! I grew up watching this movie and I'm about to invest in another copy of it ... in just a few minutes! The G & PG rated movies now are not at all what they were back in 1985. If you have a small child and are looking for a TRUE ""G"" movie, ""Hugga Bunch"" is a very good choice. It's cute, humorous, and may even add a little spark to your child's imagination! I highly recommend this movie!"
2,Great show,"Great to have in your library when you need a fast 30-minute pickup and like to laugh outloud.If you have seen it, you know. If you have not, you should!"
2,Cold war era ennui,"Delillo, in his fashion, has written a vaulting piece of historical hyperbole. Perhaps his opus, the best of this novel is in the mordant descriptions, the evocations of family life, and the volleying conversations. However, there is little of a standard plot, and the rewards of a thorough reading may only come for those with an interest in the craft of fiction."
2,ERUPTION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"What a great effort by VAN HALEN!Great songs like ""ain't talking 'bout love"" and ""little dreamer"" and great guitar works by EVH.Eddie was not only a great guitar player but the one who affected many other rock and metal musicians.I believe that this is their greatest alboum.The only negative things are the short lenght of the songs (that's too american for me)and the mediocre performance of David roth."
2,Dark and Erotic,"Ms. Hart knows how to spin a tale from everyday situations. There is the politician - well his settled with his picture perfect family until the arrival of a woman - the woman who his son loves..he falls for her and then begins the destruction...Quoting one of the lines in the book, ""damaged people know how to survive"". This is the thread of this richly deep poignant tale of love, lust and destruction.I read this book at a stage of depression so I really could not relate to it as it makes you feel all the more vulnerable and bare. This book tells things like it is. Well done Ms. Hart!!"
2,Super,I ordered and received this product very quickly with no glitches...I would be happy to do business with tis merchant again in the future.
2,classic,I wish I have found out about these guys earlier. Too bad the lead singer passed away. May his soul rest in peace.
2,"Not actually about Venus, but still a great read",This was the first Sarah Dunant book that I had read. It kept me interested throughout the whole book and am looking forward to reading more of her novels.
2,In her daughter's eyes,This books was awesome.. it gave you a perspective of what her life was like and it showed the willigness of two young brave girls growing up very rapedly. The things that they did were veryt courageous somethings i would have never eve thought possible. Just the thought of my younger sister delivering my baby gives me the chills. i recommend this book to everyone.Every chapter has a suspence to it and its very clear with its words.
2,Checked for Lead,"My son loves this tool set. He wants to help dad all the time. I did check the box and there is no longer a warning about lead. I figure with all the regulations concerning lead, that they have made changes."
2,A Good Read,"The Libertarians don't have me convinced on every issue, but they sure make a lot more sense than most pundits out there. This book is down to earth, easy to understand, and straightforward. It does an excellent job pointing out the fallacies of that insidious slippery slope we put ourselves on when we ask government to do for us that which we can and should do for ourselves. This book takes a good look at many issues from an angle which is usually overlooked in the media and in politics. It's one of those books that every American would do well to read."
2,The Left is Frightened of the Truth.,This is a great read. Mr. Hannity is Right on. The Left is so frightened of an opinion other than theirs that they resort to hate speech and slurs. It becomes clear who the Lying Liars are and how they are the intolerant left. Just look at how they review this book and get a clear view of their hate. Get this book if you want a clear vision of the way things are and the way the liberals portray them on their way to destroy the morality of this great country!
2,Sylvania 9005SU UHP Hi Beam Bulbs,I have installed a set in a Camry and a 4 Runner. Installation was easy. On a normal reasonably well lit street there is no significant difference as expected. However out on country roads there is a significant difference lighting up the sides of the road. My purpose for purchasing this item was to see animals on the roadsides when traveling.JS
2,"well done, fellas",This album manages one of the things I like best about recorded music... it covers a variety of emotions with its different songs while at the same time staying true to the band's overall sound and coming to a resolution at the end. I'm looking forward to seeing what happens to this band.
2,Camedia Pro 4.0,It was my fault with the purchase because it doesn't work with windows 7. That is very odd because 2.5 works well with 7. regardless the seller held up his end of the bargain. the shipping was excellent and the package arrived undamaged. Good Job to the seller
2,A Little Short Video From Sunday Shows,"This is a short video, about 45 minutes. It's from a his Sunday shows; it's not a weeknight Tonight Show.It has most of the regulars, Don Knots, Louis Nye, Tom Poston. And it has the best: The crazy sportscaster guy with Allen breaking up when he sees himself in the monitor.Considering that I cannot find any other video than this, I was glad to find it. I wish there would be a real way-back machine that we could see episodes from the original Tonight show."
2,African safari journal,"Book was sold as used, however it was in brand-new condition. Also received in 2 days...excellent.Also a GREAT item to take on a safari!"
2,Hooked!,"I recently became hooked on PPL. This season is amazing. I rushed home from social events and such just to watch as many episodes as I could until 2am. The story line is amazing. It flows incredibly well together which each upcoming episode,never feels as if they had to add something to pass the time. The girls you get to know as well as their relationships,its like you are in their group feeling all the emotions and drama as well. Recommend to all my friends because this show is awesome and suspenseful."
2,Amazing,"these are amazing headphones, i am on my second pair. the experience of listening to oa song with the bass on full blast, is an experience that cannot be copied by any other headphone. these are simply amazing headphones. however, the folding hinge is pretty flimsy, and can break pretty easilyi should also add, that music is not the o nly thing that sounds amazing,movies and games with anykind of gunplay are made even more intense.... it feels like somone's firing a handgun right next to your head everytime a gun is fired."
2,Mazda6 2003,Got this and it is perfectly matching. very good price and it's been there not for long (one month almost) but its working just fine
2,Refreshing! What a perspective!,"This is such a refreshing way to take a look at yourself, your intimate relationships and most importantly: you in the context of your intimate relationship. There is A LOT to think about--how you deal with fear, your identities, your childhood programming, your center, the list goes on. This book is easy and hard to read at the same time! It gets to the core of so many of the tough issues we all face in life. Stay open to yourself and read this book if you have any questions or concerns about where you're at. Most of all, have lots of compassion as you read!"
2,The future is your present thinking made manifest.,"""Liquidate the past and never dwell on old grievances or grudges. The future is your present thinking made manifest.""(37) ""I'm born to succeed; the Infinite within me can't fail. Divine law and order govern my life, Divine peace fills my soul, Divine love saturates my mind.""(70) ""If you do not choose to do your own thinking, the mass mind and the propaganda of the world will make choices for you. There is no such thing as indecision. It simply means you have decided not to decide.""(132) Just a few of the pearls to be mined from this astonishing Miracle Power that can release a flood-tide of abundance into your life. Dr. Joseph Murphy was an internationally known author, teacher, lecturer and Vice-President of the International New Thought Alliance. I have several of his books and love them all. This book is a never-ending source of inspiration and help."
2,"It's alright, but I've seen better and worse.","This isn't nearly as bad as Jason X, Halloween: Ressurection, 8 Legged Freaks, or Resident Evil. People actually jumped in this movie, but it's not as good as The Ring."
2,Clay Aiken is The Way with Solitaire,The Way/Solitaire single is a must for everyone. Clay has a voice that is flawless. He shows his emotions through his voice and leaves you wanting more. Solitaire is powerful and Clay sings with love and passion. Clay is needed in this day of such turmoil and hatred and I believe if we recognize his integrity and love through his songs and voice we will smile and understand why he is here to sing to us. Mr Neil Sedaka should be very proud to have Clay sing his song. Thank you Mr Sedaka and a special thank you to Mr Clay Aiken.
2,hoiday express train set,"I was totally happy with this product, it operated as I expected it would, Totally satisfied with the product, and it arrived on the expected date."
2,Mitford's best cooks!,Jan Karon cooks up a selection of recipes that are as delightful as her Mitford characters. This reads with familiar insights from her novels. You will want to share both tidpits and large portions with friends
2,Eleven Days In August,"This book has been touted as being Faulkner's most accessible. Although a bit easier to follow having less stream of consciousness it still requires some patience and appreciation for nuance. Further, if you take the story at face value you will be missing out on 90% of what it has to offer. The themes run deep and the characters symbolic. I'd recommend reading exerpts from One Matchless Time by Jay Parini who provides some good insights into Faulkner's life and his writings. I'd also read the review written by A.Mason (below). This was one of the more violent and sexual books that I have read of Faulkner. Although I was surprised, I was in awe of his tact and style in portraying these events in a subtly gruesome way that takes the reader off gaurd. The climactic scene of Joe Christmas's undoing was Faulkner at his best. I'd recommend this book to anyone who loves good writing and is fascinated with the tragedy of the post-Civil War southerner."
2,OCProducts printer ink cartridges,Was not happy when the printer ink cartridges arrived and would not print/printer did not recognize cartridges. OCProducts sent replacement ink cartridges and those worked. Thank you to OCProducts for resolving my issues in a timely manners.
2,Excellent addition to the Star Wars lore.,"The Lando Calrissian stories contained in this book were wonderful. While the book does have certain ""inconsistencies"" that are apparent in other early Star Wars books, it does not detract from the stories. If you are sick of the Jedi/Fett/Solo stories that pervade the Star Wars book series and you enjoy the essentially forgotten character of Lando Calrissian, then pick of ""The Adventures of Lando Calrissian,"" you won't be disappointed."
2,No Short Shrift Here,"On the heels of Henry's Wars and Shakespeare's Laws comes yet another brilliant collection from that pint-sized ball of fire, Professor Meron. Whether reading your official version of Shakespeare or another version, Meron offers insight into the chivalric themes present in these brilliant plays. Or something like that. Whether its Troilus and Cressida or Henry V, Meron is better at 8:30 in the morning than the New York Times."
2,Cool curls,"I love curls rock! This is a great product that gives you excellent curls! It is a tad pricey, but worth every penny!"
2,Vishnupuran,"Really good series, the only thing is that the sound doesn't work on couple of the DVDs. Besides that it's fine."
2,Still relevant,"The Sonic not-so-Youth are still relevant. ""Mature"" isn't the right word, as they hit the ground running eons ago; ""refined"" is more accurate here. With the exception of ""Kim Gordon and the Arthur Doyle Hand Cream,"" this album is even and mid-tempo, with the usual SY signatures: alternate tunings, controlled feedback, the occasional tribal tattoo. Some of the earlier cuts, particularly the gorgeous ""Unmade Bed,"" bear a curious resemblance to Neil Young (or is it Neil Young that sounds like Sonic Youth?) Kim Gordon's mewling on the aforementioned clunker would have been more appropriate on earlier albums. But Sonic Youth aren't about teenage riots anymore. Here they're just being themselves, and that's a good thing."
2,A modern parable with surprising depth,"Anyone who enjoys books filled with suspense, and has had some past aspirations for working with large, unpredictable animals should definitely read this book. It opens up a world of twisted imagination and offers the reader vivid characters who provide witty and often meaningful dialogue. For those who desire a quick fix of fear, yet also yearn for the powerful characteristics of a masterpiece, Jurassic Park is the book for you."
2,One of the best ever,"I am not the only one who thinks this is one of the Top 100 Albums ever made! Harry's performance is amazing on every song. And the remastering is outstanding. Good bonus tracks, too.Buy this CD now!"
2,The best adaptation by far,"The complaints by the purists miss the point that the Potter books are a little too crowded and disorganized. The first 2 movies followed the books closely and, no surprise, were too crowded and disorganized. Cuaron edits and streamlines in a way that Rowling seems unable to do: he's a better storyteller. I'm glad he didn't include endless boring quidditch scenes, etc. etc. He did fail to explain a couple of small details, but overall this is an example of superior directing."
2,The best price!,"I had been taking Megafood supplements for a while and the price of those is outrageous (can be twice the price of these, depending where you get them). These multis do not cause stomach upset or burping of any kind and they are just packed with nutrients and vitamins. Best of all, because these are whole food supplements, they are more readily absorbed and used by the body and you can also take them on an empty stomach--again--with no upset.I also love that these have spirulina and bee pollen in them!"
2,Naami's PC,"Great and clear picture, easy installation, and so many other great features for this product. The screen size makes it so much easier to see the data. Words, graphics, etc., really come alive on this beautiful monitor."
2,Book,Was recently able to go to a Studor group seminar. Am thoroughly enjoying the book. Very easy to read.
2,My son has cerebral palsy.,"As the parent of a son with cerebral palsy, I always believed all the things about mindset Dr. Dweck says, yet in my commitment to helping him be all he could be, unintentionally helped him develop a fixed mindset by telling him he was smart. Since reading Mindset, I'm helping him develop a growth mindset. In less than a week, he has changed from someone who ""stunk"" in math to someone who is learning math."
2,A Must Have If You're Trying To Conceive!,"It took my husband and I 6 years to become pregnant. I found out about this book around year 4 and was so amazed at all of the things I never knew about my body and my fertility. I can't say enough wonderful things about this book. I think every woman should own a copy whether she is trying to conceive or not. The information in it is for every woman to know. There were things I learned that I had never been told in a doctor's office, and many ""mysteries"" that were explained to me in plain, simple language. I copied and used the chart she provides in the book for several months, and because of the information they provided my OB/GYN was able to properly diagnose my ""infertility"" problem. I'm now the mother of a very precious baby boy!"
2,Great Cards / Need a box,"The cards just came and they're great. Great pictures, hints on how to make the signs and a good size for small children. I got these as my daughter is learning sign language in school and i don't know it. Figured it's a good way to reinforce what she's learning there and for me to learn as well.I'll laminate them as another reviewer recommended (thanks). but would be great if they had come in some sort of box so they can be stored when not being used.I'll find something to hold them in for sure but I was surprised when the loose cards came in shrink wrap.I would definitely recommend them to others."
2,Best of the best...,"It's not my favorite expansion but it is very fun throwing parties. I found this expansion to be the most ""social"" than any other expantion, besides Sims Hot Date (Which is my favorite expansion.) Whenever your Sim is socialy deprived you can easily throw a party. There are also More than 80 new objects, including a dance cage, mechanical bull, etc. Also there is new characters, costumes, and music. This game is a must buy and will expand it a lot."
2,"Great sound, new ear bud design","There are a great replacement for any stock ear bud you might get with your media player. The last pair I bought broke in about a month, but this new set has a redesigned ear bud and I don't think they will be breaking anytime soon. Very comfortable in-ear headphone. I use mine at the gym and on the Metro. They block out the world."
2,IT GETS THIS SLUG BUG MOVING!!!!!,"Thanks to Billy Blanks I am no longer a slug bug, I started tae-bo in february a little more than a month ago and I have gotten more compliments on my body toning, starting after the first week!...I used to sit around all day and watch TV about at least eight hours straight in one day, I popped in the tape saw billy and the crew do the moves and I was like ""That looks easy,"" I tried it, I am addicted to getting in shape the tae-bo way, and it's not too fast or too slow...it's given me energy and sometimes on impulse I find myself throwing out a right hook...I'm telling you people...it is well worth money and with the eight minute work out tape well worth the time...GET IT! I am not in any way getting paid for this I am just a regular person living a normal lifestyle, and now thanks to Billy, I am more energized...and to those who thinks Tae-Bo is overrated...I challenge you to put your fitness where your mouth is and TRY IT!!! Much love Billy..."
2,Another Fine Glucerna Product for Diabetics,"The similar Kellogg's products are only slightly lower in total carbohydrates than Glucerna's. More importantly, one must evaluate how those carbs affect diabetics. I cannot determine for anyone else, what their glucose response is; however, for me, the initial glucose spike from Kellogg's product was significantly higher--nearly double--that for Glucerna's over the next three hours.I suggest that all diabetics do similar tests before you settle on any cereal, including Glucerna's."
2,Awesomely comedic!,"I never was a Chris Rock fan until I saw ""Bring the Pain"" on HBO. Every opportunity I get to watch it I anxioulsy take. ""Saturday Night Live"" never gave just deserts to Chris's style of comedy. And he has yet to be duplicated. I find myself actually quoting his sayings and takes on life because...oh, it is so true. END"
2,ProAccurate Quick Tip Thermometer,I'm happy with this product for the most part. I only wish it would calculate the temperature faster but for the price it's great.
2,spinners,These are new spinners for me. i hope to catch some really big fish. Im sure they will work fine.
2,So much good information,"I had to read the book from to back before using it, there was soo much wonderful information. So far I have used the recipes for making Jam and Jellies with the Universal Pectin and refer to it for dehydrating. I absolutely love it!!"
2,A Real Twist,I loved this book. It was the first of Rebecca Forster's books but certainly won't be the last. She kept me guessing all the time. Twists and turns in the story kept me on the edge of my seat and anxious to get back to the book each night. I would recommend it to anyone who likes a good thriller.
2,Season 2 just gets better!,"At first, I didn't think I'd enjoy this show. It's like a dramatic Seinfeld. A show about nothing other than the lives of the characters. But I have to admit, I really got into it. The acting is great, the characters are interesting and the the detail with which they go about recreating the 60's is truly astonishing. I've been hooked on this show since season 1 and it's definitely worth owning. Season 2 is more of the same, but after you've gotten to know the characters, it's really fun to watch them evolve and see where their self destructive lives lead."
2,A Fork in the Road,"What can a devotee expect from the man who has some thirty albums to his credit? To constantly reinvent yourself after three plus decades could only be done by Van the Man.No one has the chops to reinvent Ray Charles save for Van. His version of Hoagy Carmichael's ""Georgia"" has moments of brilliance where Van shows he still has ""fire in the Belly.Shuffle tunes, ""Down the Road"", ""Choppin Wood,"" and theexceptional, ""Hey, Mr.DJ"" showcase Van's penchant for saxophones and strings and organ. His roots are in the blues and this Road takes us there.New Orleans is given its due with a lyrical interpretation and solo by famed clarinetist, Acker Bilk.Probably not his ""best""album but certainly worth the purchase.....the Irish/Celtic/Angry/Blues veteran has returned to a mellower pathway.Good to have a new album with that splendid voice that evokes nuances and phrasing like no other......repetitive and growling and mellow and as we have also come to expect, musicians who complement this icon."
2,"Seuss has Wacky, Wonderful, illustrations!",Green Eggs and Ham is a classic because the wonderful rhyming text helps kids remember the simple funny story. The illustrations are what really knock me out though. Not many illustrators dare to go so far with their originality.
2,Definitely Loud,"Haven't had to use this yet, but tried it out and it's LOUD! Which is good, as if you do have to ever use it, the point is to get people's attention. Turning it off is tricky, but again the point is that a would-be attacker wouldn't be able to easily turn it off. The light is handy also. The only thing I don't like is that it's a little big for attaching to a key chain, I wish it were a little smaller."
2,Best sheets ever made...,"If they were only in a higher thread count I'd give them six stars. These are the only sheets I'll ever use from now on. They fit amazingly and NEVER EVER pull off the corners (such an annoyance).If you have a thick mattress, like me, then you know the frustrations of finding sheets that fit and don't pull off. These are the ones you're looking for. Buy em. They're so great."
2,Great bread maker,I have been happy with the results of using the machine for various types of bread and rolls.
2,Just so cool!,"I am surprised it hasn't been done before, or if it has not as good as this i bet. These wheels are just great. They look absolutely fabulous. I reckon even if you aren't into cars or car accessories you would still be impressed by the look of this wheel. I have seen some blue ones around as well but the red looks far better to me, and the picture on this page doesn't quite do it justice. The quality of this clock is so good too they seem to be a really well made item - especially for a clock. The ends of the hands (or rather screwdriver, spanner and gauge needle) glow in the dark as well as the numbers. And the price is quite good (hmmm... wish I had seen this before I got mine - I paid more and still thought it was a good deal). Great for a present or something like that or maybe just a good impulse buy. Now all I need is a workshop to hang it in :)"
2,The Time Machine,"Really Great to see this clasic again. Arrived in good time, no defects and good condition. thank you"
2,Excellent except for....,"Dr Quillan has written an excellent book. Especially the nutrition aspect. My only complaint is that there are literally hundreds of supplements to choose from. For me, it was a little overwhelming.At times, it felt like searching for a needle in a haystck. After suffering through BRUTAL chemo for 12 treatments that made me DEATHLY ill, I am convinced that I could not go through that again. The oncologist predicts this rare form of lymphoma will be back in about 5 years. So, I consulted a naturopath to help direct me, and to my surprise almost everything she currently has me on is found in Dr. Quillan's book. Plus, I have never eaten healthier in my life. Thank you Dr. Quillan! I hope to prove the oncologist wrong!"
2,It's not That Difficult!!!!!! Please!!,I took this Zoid apart and all u people out there that say this zoid is hard to put together u r wrong. I took it apart and put it back together in 34 minutes!!!! i even timed moself. i absolutely love this Zoid.
2,Outstanding debut is still her best album,"Mindy is a brilliant singer and gets the chance to show it on this excellent collection of songs. The title track is a song about vulnerability while Guys do it all the time is an amusing look at different attitudes regarding men and women. Other favorites of mine include Maybe he'll notice her now and A girl's gotta do what a girl's gotta do, although every song here is a gem.The first nine tracks are (as far as I know) all originals, but the album closes with an oldie, Breaking it, which first appeared on a Claire Lynch album in the early eighties. Claire wasn't very enthusiastic about that album, but some great singers have covered songs from it.Mindy has recorded some great music on her (so far) three subsequent albums, but none of those albums come close to matching the overall brilliance of this debut album. This is what I call quality contemporary country."
2,The best Movies in the world!,"These are the best movies in the world. ""The Mummy"" is touching and thrilling. ""The Mummy Returns"" is funny, touching and thrilling too. See both of these movies and you will be thrilled of what you watched. These movies are not a waste of money if you buy them. You will have no choice but to Love them. See them both. You'll love it! Go and see both of them now!"
2,Mel Brooks is a genius!,"Mel Brooks' movies are top-notch. They are a laugh-a-minute roller-coaster ride. Every plot is clever, the characters are humorous, and the action non-stop. These movies are definitely a must-see."
2,"No fluff, just the facts.","I'm very surprised that this was an open-an-shut case of suicide. After reading both sides of this story, I feel I am able to make a pretty objective opinion about this whole thing; Kurt was murdered. You can't explain away the facts in this case. The case needs to be reopened and thoroughly examined by the PROPER authorities.This book was written in an objective manner, that's why I highly recommend it. I've read it more than once; I find it highly intriguing."
2,Mine had a flaw.,"My first review indicated Targus had raised the bar here in quality. However, not too long ago while waiting for my plane in an airport with this case, I went searching through it for something, only to discover that one of the brand new netted pockets had broken entirely loose on one side (unravelled without any apparent cause or strain) which caused one of my family heirloom cufflinks to ""disappear"". The missing cufflink later reappeared in the lower area into which it had dropped. Thankfully, it wasn't lost, although it certainly had every opportunity. Please disregard the five stars. Replace with two. Although this case has many nice features, attention to EVERY detail is vital when building a quality case, particuarly one touted for the traveler."
2,Good without Modules,"This is a very comfortable case and I have had no problems with the clip. My only complaint is that it doesn't have enough clearance if I have a module in the visor. Also, I'll need to find a different case now that I have my visorphone and keep that in all the time."
2,Illustrated Corvette Buyer's Guide,"Interesting book if you are looking for details - only goes to 1997 Vettes. Was looking for current pricing information (book has sticker prices); somewhat like blue book values on various models based upon mileage, etc. Was trying to avoid my own cost analysis process as I am looking for a vette and trying not to spend months trying to figure out going market prices."
2,"Quick, Fun Read!","I read this book in one afternoon! I just love stories that have saucy women and knuckle-headed guys and this book fits the bill. Throw in a couple of brothers and a meddling father and I'm sure you'll enjoy the read as much as I did. Oh yeah; there's some neckin' in there if you like that, too. Four thumbs up!"
2,Oh memory!,"I first heard this record back in the early eighties, about the time I saw the band on its ""Modern Times"" tour (July 4, 1981). I was impressed with the fact that a rock band was combining political and spiritual lyrics, at a time when the J. Geils Band and Billy Joel seemed to be the rule. Spiritual? Yes, despite Paul Kantner's continuing hostility, Jeanette and Pete Sears were actually using Christian undertones (overtones, too), in their songs, such as in ""Save Your Love"", on Modern Times, where Jesus is almost directly quoted. I've heard Mr. Sears deny these were Christian songs, but they clearly had spiritual or religious content. And, the band's longtime political activism continued. Freedom at Point Zero contains some of both. It's a good album, despite what the critics said, and it holds up well today. For those Kantner fans, his presence is fairly heavy here. If you look to rock, and to think and reflect, this is for you."
2,Lucky Charms Adult Costume,It fit fine and did the job i needed it to. Highly recommend it for anybody looking for a good halloween costume. The hats pretty cool.
2,OK intro to QM,"This is a pretty decent introduction to QM. Not many prereqs are assumed which is good. Ch. 4 is organized a bit strangely (angular momentum is presented after the hydrogen atom). However, you will probably have to read a more advanced book to move on to QFT."
2,Great but...,"After seeing how much a friend's cat loved this item, I thought my cats would enjoy it too, but obviously I was wrong. I do think that this item is a fantastic idea, but apparently I have two ridiculous, finicky and down-right stuck up cats who do not want to work for their food, lol, but I still would recommend this item."
2,Honeywell HZ519,"This is far above the others we have had. Quiet, thermostatically controlled, and throws off alot of heat"
2,Excellent value for the money,"I chose free supersaving from amazon and the bike still arrived in three days - during Christmas week no less. The bike is extremely sturdy and accommodates both short and tall users. The parts are mostly assembled upon arrival so the assembly is quick and painless. You basically have to put together 4 major parts. No mess or confusion. Great workout! The resistance knob is easiy accessible and not tempermental at all. However, like all spin bikes, recommend a gel seat cover for a more comfortable ride.Bike also comes with a nice touch....it not only has a water bottle holder, but it also comes with a water bottle. High recommend...especially for the price."
2,good enough for the price.,"2nd time ordering this. I do like them for certain things better than others. Works great in my blood pressure machine. Not so great in remotes. Really good in my out door wind chime that lights up. One battery last 3 weeks in it. Not so good in my digital camera. So for depending on what you want it for, could be good or weak. They say these are used in hospitals, so that's probably why my blood pressure machine loves these things. For that alone I will keep buying."
2,"Nice, but watch out","My wife and I really like this rocker, but it tends to lean forward when it rocks forward. You really NEED the ottoman to feel balanced-especially when holding a squirming little munchkin. Otherwise, it's great and well worth the money. If I had it to do again, I think I would have bought the one that's a little more expensive just for the padding and the hope that it might be better balanced."
2,-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-To KiLL a MoCkiNgBirD-+-+-+-+-+-+-+,"This book produces a spectacular amount of insight. The plot, in my opinion, proves to be a strong one with interesting and realistic characters that make the book even more interesting. The plot was cleverly made to not only tell a story, but to express to the readers life long lessons, that apply today and in the future. Although the book is extremely well-written, the last few chapters didn't really flow with the plot. Although exciting, I found that it was slightly out of sync. This heartfelt story will hopefully be passed down for many generations to come; so that we not only realize the moral values that we often neglect, but we learn that life is full of adventure, courage, and ups and downs."
2,Finally - A product that works,My West Highland Terrier's skin always flaked using the traditional natural shampoos found at the local pet stores. This product smells great and works. It doesn't dry out my dog's skin.
2,Good but slowed down by overly detailed nautical descriptions and dreams,"Overall an interesting story, but I began to skip sections of it because I'm not that interested in detailed sailing descriptions, and especially I'm not interested in dreams that you think are real and turn out to be a dream (this happened several times and it was hard to tell WHAT was going on.)"
2,the show I loved to watch,I loved this show when it was on the air. I watched it every week. And I am happy it is on dvd so I can watch it with friends or by myseslf
2,Must Read for Children,Christine Amos is a great story teller and little children will not be able to put this book down. They will also start to read other books and change their lives through literacy - Wally's passion.Wally and Christine have also created dolls to remind little people of the wonderful story told in this book.Dickson C. Buxton
2,Hail to Michael Penn!,"The party scene music when they are coming on to the ecstacy is track 13 ""Nothing Like Us"" by Michael Penn. It is just as beautiful on the CD as it is in the movie. It is the freshest sound in music I have heard in a long time. Mr. Penn has managed to create a peice of music that is captivating and haunting, and leaves you wanting more......."
2,The Absolute Greatest Album in the Black Metal Underground,"This is the first and last album ever to evoke such pure darkness. All the songs are the best MayheM has ever done, and Attila's (Tormentor/Plasma Pool) vocals are completely godlike...no one could have sung the album better & with more emotion, regardless of what people may think. I would go on, but then this review would end up being huge. Buy this CD...that's all I can say."
2,Hilarious,"Thank you for a fast shipment, the movie is hilarious. I will definately buy from amazon again. Very reasonable price also. Thanks again for a great movie that i added to my collection."
2,No more dead plants,"Very good product. Our hanging plants always die while we are on vacation. This year they actually grew while we were gone! Very easy to install though instructions are somewhat vague,(I am a mechanic and I was able to figure most of it out without instructions).Also, there are not enough hose clips for an overhead installation for hanging plants. Overall, I am very satisfied with this product. Note: Ad says 1/2"" hose but is really 1/4""."
2,Nice Case,"I have a 17"" laptop whose chassis is more like an 18"", and I despaired at find a useful case that would carry it well, but this product is doing a fine job. Plenty of pockets for extra items, inside and out. My only tiny complaints is that the should strap buckles get bound up occasionally, but very easily fixed. For the money, a great buy."

2,She loved it,My wife is Brazilian and has a hard time understanding English in movies but she enjoyed this movie very much. If you like romantic comedies we highly recommend this movie. Matthew Perry and Selma Hayek were great together.
2,One of the Best Writers,I could not put this book down once I stared and I finished it in one sitting. It was a great read from beginning to end with twists and turns that surprise even the most devoted dark-hunter readers. More about Ash and a new dark-hunter that you would never guess. I am still trying to put it all together and I can't wait for the next in this series. Keep them coming Ms. Kenyon. They get better and better.
2,Difficulty in setup,The router works fine but the setup instructions given in the enclosed CD-ROM did not work and I had to get Linksys support on the phone. After that things were set up fine.
2,VERY GOOD!!!,"this is a very good video that is slowly paced and not oeverly taught; i loved FITMAMA Prenatal and really liked being able to slowly get back into my fitness routine after having my baby; this is not an advanced workout, but i did not need that nor did i want it; i loved this style of exercise and the options are endless, and Leisa Hart is incredible with making me feel like i am not ""working"" out but rather i am relaxing my body and providing much needed conditioning to my body, i suggest this video be bought before you deliver and have it ready to go immediately, it is VERY GOOD!"
2,Very helpful,"Our children (ages 2 and 1) are very light sleepers. While on a trip my friend had this in the guest bedroom. I was able to talk on the phone in the same room as my sleeping 1 year old! Crazy. That sold me on it. Once we got home, I ordered it right away. The night waking has diminished. :-) Worth the money for us."
2,"Precise, Charged Up, and Awesome Sounding,","""Bloom"" is a diverse, fantastic collection of sounds and melodies that will surely please any Eric Johnson fan and those who are new to his music. The album begins with the rockier stuff and progresses to more subtle songs towards the second half of the CD. Johnson is a master of every lick, phrase, and riff. Not a single note or beat is wasted. Yet, his music still retains a ""live"" feel. This type of musical precision makes for an eminently satisfying sonic experience. Johnson has been playing and recording for a while, but he is still getting better with time. Overall, ""Bloom"" is inspiring and sounds marvelous.(Simeon Hein is the author of OPENING MINDS and PLANETARY INTELLIGENCE and composer of the CDs EARTH DREAMING and OPENING SKIES.)"
2,Nice bra! Happy to find this size!!,"This is perfect for me! I needed a strapless bra for my son's wedding, and I also needed the molded cups that give a smooth appearance and a little help for my ""girls."" It's so hard to find anything in the stores over a 36 so this was wonderful!!!"
2,An inspired collection of soulfull emotional medicine.,"This artist surely has got an original style that transends normal folk rock. The albums cajun fried swing is both refreshing and inspiring both lyricaly and musicaly. The collection of musicians meld together on the same plane, as if catching the songwriters spirit in thier souls. I especially liked the washboard player!"
2,I don't know what you are all complaining about.,"For the price you are more than getting your moneys worth. Now I'm no sound engineer or anything remotely close to that but I can tell when something sounds good and when it sounds bad. I am more than pleased with my purchase of this set. I tried it on my iPod Shuffle, iPod video, PSP, LCD TV, and PC and it sounds outstanding in each and every device. My family was listening to it and when I asked them how much they thought I paid for them they all guessed $200-$300. I have no regrets here. I'm using them on practically every device and am pleased with the sound. I highly recommend them, and to the person that said the sub makes a buzzing noise when off, I have yet to experience that problem. Great product, great price, worthy purchase."
2,Dog Door,The product was very easy to install and works very well for our dog to keep the elements out expecially here in the midwest.
2,Good old songs,It fun to listen to old songs and wonder who sang that or what's the name of that song most them are on this album.
2,Don't Study the Massorah Without it,"This main reason to buy this is for the annotated glossary od massoretic terms. It's the best guide to use those oh-so-cryptic massoretic notes on the margins of BHS. Many detailed definitions of the words and abbreviations-- far more useful information than most other similar introductions to BHS. I give it four stars instead of five because I wish they had done the same thing for the critical apparatus at the bottom. Other books cover the critical apparatus, but I think these authors could explain it much better than any other book currently does."
2,Toys These Days...,"it's crazy how people can come up with this stuff. These tooth tunes tooth brushes are really facinating actually. The song plays in your mouth for a whole 2 minutes so you're brushing your teeth for the dentist suggested time. Parents will love it too, if you don't want to sit and watch your children brush their teeth, but make sure they're brushing them long enough, get them this! They can choose from a bunch of different songs and artists. It'll be music to your ears, and teeth!"
2,Time to Turn it Up to 11 on the 360,"The smash hit Guitar Hero finally makes its way to the 360 and it is easily the best in the series so far. Features include all the songs from the PS2 verion plus 10 exclusive songs, downloadable content, acheievements & online leaderboards.I already own the PS2 version, but the thought of playing in HD with online leaderboards was more than enough to make me purchase GHII again. However, the first one I bought was defective. The game ran slowly and stuttered, and the whammy bar on the guitar was completely jacked. Returned it for another and it works perfectly fine now.Nothing beats playing Guitar Hero II with your friends and a case of your favorite beverage. It is truly the ultimate party game that everyone can enjoy!"
2,Simply Amazing Music Theatre!,"This record was unlike any record in pop culture when it was released in the mid-seventies. The closest genre I can affiliate it with is ambient, but this one with scare you not sooth you! If you don't know anything about The Residents, I would NOT suggest starting with this one, but you will end up getting it in the end. The following decade, the San Francisco Bay band got noted for their theatrical performances, largely driven by the underground success of this record. One does not merely listen to this record. It draws you deep to places you have never been and may not want to ever visit ! This is music so-to-speak to make to shiver and think. Artistically astounding! Great spin and not for dancing!"
2,Interesting book,A very interesting story about what life was like in Africa before colonization and how it changed after it.
2,Love!,"I love this blush! Very nice color, shows up nicely. It does have glitter in it, which I wasn't expecting, but it isn't over powering. I absolutely love it!!!"
2,Pretty Good- one complaint,"For newborns- the tub is great using the mesh net. But they're not infants for long. I think I got about 4 months out of it.For infants (about 4 mos and up), it's pretty good for the most part. My complaint is this: my 7 mo old who is quite chunky keeps sliding down in it. Her [...] won't stay in the grooved part where they're supposed to keep it. She twists and turns and it gets slippery and she starts to slide down. Consequently, I have to keep one hand holding her crotch area to prevent her from slipping under the water. This doesn't make for easy washing w/ only one hand left to use. For that reason, I don't think it's the best.EDITED:I've owned this tub for 3 1/2 years. Used it with my first son and then with my daughter. It wasn't until about 4-5 mos after daughter's birth that I realized that I could sit my child straight up on the ""toddler"" side and then I don't have the slipping problem! Ugh. So much for my fancy college and graduate degrees!"
2,"Solid OEM product, works great for the LG C2000","It's sad when an already cheap South Korean product has even cheaper knockoffs from China but that's exactly the problem I ran into with other sellers. I tried a couple other products which claimed to work for my phone but none of them actually did, I believe it was the unstable voltage as the cause, the two other chargers were both made in China and listed voltages from 4.5-7.5, and the other one said 5.0-9.5 which just didn't work right in my phone. Sadly those details were not in their listings and it wasn't worth the hassle to send the items back.This one is branded LG, so you know it's legit OEM, and fixed voltage of 4.6v which is what my phone needs. Sometimes it doesn't pay to look for the cheapest item, you may end up buying more than one ;)"
2,Timing your call writing is critical for maximum benefit,"This book offers a good introduction to covered call writing , is easy to understand and follow. If you are already practicing covered call writing as I have been for several years you are probably aware of the importance of timing when to sell your covered calls. By selling calls at the wrong time you could end up losing your stock and giving up further stock profits which are usually much higher than the covered call premiums you obtained. Unfortunately this book does not go into strategies for timing your sale so as to enhance your premium value but avoid the stock being called. I would recommend that this book be supplemented by other books that go into more detailes on timing option sales or purchases. I have been able to at least double my returns by using good timing strategies in addition to ideas in this book."
2,Goodguy vs. Monster,Very entertaining. I have read it twice so far and loved it. Its alot like that old Dean Koontz book Watchers but has way more action. I wish there were more books like this.
2,"""The War"" is worth fighting for.","Being a major Elijah Wood fanatic,I have quite a bit of experience in judging his films.""The War""(starring Elijah Wood,Kevin Costner,and Lexi Randall)is,in my opinion,one of,if not the best films he has ever made.Set in post-Vietnam Mississippi,""The War"" not only addresses the stresses of the father(Costner)but the stress under which his children(Wood and Randall) have to contend with.The phrase ""The War"" not only refers to the Vietnam War,but the feud between two lower-class Southern families(or mainly,their children).Even though the big name star in ""The War"" is Kevin Costner,the show is stolen by the children.Elijah Wood(Lord Of The Rings) and Lexi Randall(Sarah,Plain and Tall)portray adolecsent siblings who are dealing with the anguish their father is feeling and their own anguish within their feud.In my opinion,""The War"" is THE family film,and is for anyone who has a minimal amount of taste."
2,The Y2K has held some pleasant surprises,"Yo', from a guy who plays an instrument's standpoint, this album, like Voodoo, is the bomb. Though I play keyboards (for Brass Construction) & love & do sequencing, this other approach (live) is for real. Check out ""Cold Blooded"" - the beat is serious + the Big Daddy Kane phrasing reminds me of the best of old school. ""Afrodisiac"" has some really great guitar that rivals Hendrix. Common's lyrics like always have a hint of righteousness and a disarming lack of self-righteousness. Way to go, brother! Big ups to Roy Hargrove for the respect he shows to hip-hop in the way he plays + , of course, for his awesome jazz chops.Danny DX"
2,whats the hold up,Wonder Years is one of the best shows ever made.I have been looking for this dvd and wondering why it has not been released.My kids that are between ages 5-10 also love these show too.We want it and we want it soon!
2,"The wild, the young, and the brilliant","A dynamite leap from Springsteen's charming debut, ""The Wild, the Innocent & the E Street Shuffle"" is a rock & roll gem. It's a glimmering kaleidoscope of organs, pianos, saxophones, bass, guitar, and drums, all led by jive-talking wild man ringleader Springsteen, who has perfected his Van Morrison-after-a-year-in-the-swamp hoot and growl. Somersaultingly lyrical, breathtaking in its youthful inventiveness, and incessantly energizing, from the raucous opening number to the sweeping romanticism of the nine-minute epic ""New York City Serenade,"" ""The Wild, the Innocent & the E Street Shuffle"" is one of rock music's most magnificent achievements."
2,Kelly's Chance #1,I have read most all of Wanda Brunstetter's books and have never been disappointed. She is an awesome writer. She can hold a reader captive in her stories!! I highly recommend all her book!
2,In space no one can hear you scream!,5 stars are not enough..absolutely the best alien/horror movie ever made..Sigourney Weaver was a perfect fit..Great story and horrifically believable..
2,"First one was defective, Amazon to the rescue...","We received the order in a very timely fashion. It was given as a gift but the recipient was very disappointed when they plugged the set in. The picture was almost totally blue with diagonal lines and the picture on the screen was crooked. Contact was made to Amazon, they sent a replacement set and picked up the defective TV at no charge. THAT's the way customer service SHOULD be! Thank Amazon for being a company with some integrity. We buy from Amazon all the time and will continue to make purchases from them and through them.PS. The replacement TV works great, looks great, sounds great and fits perfectly for the space its being used in..."
2,It will touch your heart and soul.,"I have this ""album"" (before CD's) and it is so worn from play that I ordered the CD. EXCELLENT! I highly recommend this CD to all people and especially Christians! It will indeed touch your heart and stir your soul."
2,Cannot Complain!,"After much research for the best bottle out there it appeared that Dr. Brown's would be it. So I bought the wide-neck ones (since they are suppose to be better for switching between breast and bottle) and have to say that I made the right choice. I have had no problems with using this bottle, not even with leaks, which seems to be a big problem with many brands.My baby does not spit-up or gas-up with this bottle. And never had any nipple confusion switching between breast and bottle since she began at three weeks old. Mind you, this was a big concern for me since I wanted to continue breastfeeding once I returned to work. And, not to mention, I wanted other family members be able to enjoy feeding the little one too.Bottom line...baby and I are both very happy. I highly recommend Dr. Brown's bottles. Yeah, they cost a little more and require a few moments more of cleaning time. But neither was an issue with me as I wanted the best for my baby, which I am sure you do too."
2,great product,helps keep things cleaner only draw back is that its kind of big you will need a large area for it.
2,Congrats Jamie & Katie!!!,"I have been following these guys for years (since '93), And they have grown & matured with grace! Believe me, they are as cool as there music. Wonderful album, but the newest one yet (don't know the title, yet) is going to be on Bulletproof records & comes out in JUNE/JULY '99!!!!!!"
2,Cheap but does the job,I would not call this a bulletproof product as it appears cheaply made but it does the job well. I am using it to power a camcorder on a motorcycle.
2,Loved it! Must READ!!!,This book is so entertaining.. I read it in ONE SITTING! It will make you laugh out loud and cheer on the heroine. A Great love story about a real Casanova finding true love. I cant wait to read book #2.
2,Wow and thank you!!,"In my alternative certification course, I have learned about school structures. I have learned about having an aligned curriculum, Bloom's Taxonomy, Small Learning Groups, writing lesson plans, inclusive classrooms, state standards, national standards.... The problem was I had no idea how to put any of this into play. What are logistics of running a classroom? Enter Dr. Wong. Now I have a much better idea of what I need to do the first day of class. How to run a classroom so the teaching can happen. This book came with a CD which was fun to watch. I viewed it first. I got to see and hear Dr. Wong. As I was reading the book it was like he was right there talking to me. This book is simply stated and gives the reader real helps and starting places to put that final polish on their teaching."
2,Review of Season 2,"Quite enjoyable...contrasting the prim, proper and often scandalous behavior of those ""Upstairs"" with the ""downstairs"" crew who also have their prejudices as well. Love this period."
2,Great album!,"Pick it up if you love AL Green! I had the Greatest hits but needed this album for ""How do you mend a broken heart"" and the rest of the album is incredible. A must buy!"
2,Glimpse into the teenage mind,"John Marsden has a knack for getting into his teen character's heads, making them authentic and endearing. Marina, the writer of a journal for English class, takes her readers through an interesting and very revealing trek through her life, showing what it actively takes to overcome the loss of her family and an incident which left her terribly disfigured."
2,Dare to be a Great Writer,"I wouldn't rate it five stars because only great works deserve five stars. But as a ""how to"" book, this one is splendid. It has everything. The advice is good stuff: beyond the conventional wisdom, it is insightful and plainly derived from the author's own experiences. A lot of ""don't listen to . . ."" which I appreciate. The style of the book is unique. No chapters, just tidbits in no particular order. Just wisdom. Thirdly, the thing is well written and entertaining, especially the examples which are often hilarious. Good job, Leonard Bishop!"
2,Order at least half size down.,"This is currently my favorite work pump. Being a fresh college graduate, I found it often more expensive to have a job than to be without one. I spent a ton of money (that I didn't have) on new business casual clothes. I found the black leather pumps on sale last year, so I bit the bullet and got them. Definitely order a half size down. I usually wear a 6.5 (most often) or 7 (seldom) and I had to get them in a 6. I found that if I ordered true to size, I ""step out"" of the shoes, and it's REALLY uncomfortable to walk in. But with a more snug fit, the comfort level of this shoe is out of this world. I work about 10 hours/day in a two-story building and never once had a blister problem. But please do where nude bootie socks to preserve the quality of the shoe! After wearing my first ones almost every day for a year, it was finally time for me to order a new pair and I couldn't get myself to explore other options in fear that they would be less comfortable than these!"
2,Great Book!,"Marvellously comprehensive, with quite a diverse range of topics relating to horror and people who are associated with the genre, and other such entries.A pretty handy guide for horror film buffs, as this is the major category it covers (couldn't expect more from a ""BFI"" (British Film Institute) Companion though, could you? :-) ).On the downside, some of the entries can be a little overcrowded with film titles, but good for the completist, i guess.I'd love to see further editions, with more up-to-date info (it WAS printed in '96, afterall.)Defintately a recommended buy."
2,not a significant upgrade,"Except for the chapter by Stu Bergman, almost nothing has changed from the previous edition. The previous edition was good but there is essentially no updating. I could not locate any reference to BRONJ- a huge oversight. SAVE YOUR MONEY if you have the 2nd ed. Otherwise, it's still okay.I have returned it."
2,"Blondie Live (essentially their ""Greatest Hits Live"")","This concert video was recorded in 1983, and features Blondie at their peak. It includes:1. RAPTURE2. ISLAND OF LOST SOULS3. DANCE WAY4. THE TIDE IS HIGH5. HEART OF GLASS6. HANGING ON THE TELEPHONE7. DREAMIN'8. ONE WAY OR ANOTHER9. WAR CHILD10. START ME UP11. CALL ME"
2,Keepyourteeth,"This is perfect for me, I work full time and there are 4 25-35 minute work outs that I can manage. AND I have been doing them a few weeks, now about 5 times a week, and I already feel stronger and better about myself. I am 53 years old, and it helps me to have strength and good range of motion, and I have already seen that rubber tire around my waist get smaller! I feel great!! Thanks so much FIRM!!!"
2,Alphaville's third album a curious blend,"After the overproduced nonsense of ""Afternoons.."", this album was a definite breath of fresh air, if uneven. Its also a hard one to judge, because some of the songs are so good (the title track, ""She fades away"", ""Heaven or Hell""), and some are almost unlistenable (""Ariana"", ""Middle of the Riddle""). The synth arrangements are a bit dull: we're still waiting for the lightness and elegance of ""Forever Young"". Marian's voice sounds a bit deeper here, and he's striving for more vocal range. All taken into account, a pretty good album."
2,A HIT,"I bought these for a Christmas present for my son, and he loved it!! It was a huge hit with him!"
2,Good book on the fundamentals of O/S design and theory,"This book was the required reading for one of my college programming courses. The authors go in to good details about the specifics of all subjects relating to operating systems in general. Some that were notable were the use and creation of semaphore objects, threading, CPU scheduling, and disk scheduling algorithms. The semaphores and threading were particularly useful in completing the classic synchronization problem 'The Dining Philosophers' which was one of the assignments for the course. The breakdown of disk organization was another very beneficial and highly interesting topic. The book covers MAC OS, Linux, Unix, Windows, as well as some information about older systems such as DOS and CP/M. The book has generalized examples and each topic includes a good deal of theory. I do not recommend this book for people without a solid foundation of C or C++. It helps to know Assembly as well, but not necessary."
2,"good taste, excellent nutritional profile","i guess i'll start out the review by stating that while i like the taste, i prefer the myoplex flavor. i know i'm in the minority on this.there are many positives with this product, such as the low volume of water needed to mix the shake. 10oz is a pretty small amount of water, and if you take a few supplements that you mix with water, less volume is always better."
2,great cd,"i went to a daphne loves derby show that included this providence and sherwood in their set. and out of all the bands, i like this providence, even more than dld's performance! so at the venue i bought their album and it was just great. i just wished i knew the songs prior to hearing it onstage but theres another oppurtunity for me to go see them again and i will defintely take it. what makes this album great is that each song is different, still carrying a catchy tune. my two favorite songs in the album is ""well versed"" and ""Best wishes."" the reason why i like these two songs are that they are catchy and a great representation of what styles this providence can combine with their equipment and musical talent. so buy this cd."
2,Smaller than expected.,"While seller indicates that pillow is 13"" by 20"", this size applies to a completely unstuffed pillow. The pillow size that you receive with the buckwheat inside is 11&1/2"" by 18"". While this is a small pillow, it still suits the purpose and is of apparent good construction and packaged well. It is very hard initially (actually received a stiff neck from it!) but seems to be getting more comfortable (maybe it just takes acclimating to it). Will continue to use pillow in hopes that seller and other buyers are correct in that it will improve quality of sleep comfort in time."
2,Book titled Emmerton Family,I was so glad to receive this book. It is just what I was looking for. The serviced was great! *****
2,Best Gift For Action Crazy Kids,"This playset is an answer to the doll playsets that girls have in plenty. Finally the boys get to have a playset that caters to teir 'action' role play needs. It has a playmat which nicely background sthe army battlefield havin grass, river and sand. the playset also gives 3D Tree and bush figures which can serve as hideouts for the soldiers. There are about 70-80 soldiers representing two armies. The soldiers are in different strike positions. Very well crafted.

The set is compelte in itslef and gives endless opportunity to kids to play amongst themeselves. my 4 year old got itwhen he was 2.5 years and he continues to play with it full steam even now."
2,Great watch for the money....,I am very happy with this watch. I replaced my G-shock with this one and while it is not quite as nice I like it. It is also quite a bit lighter than the G-shock. You will not be disappointed with this purchase.
2,wonderful use of music in an audiotape,"I'm halfway through listening to the unabridged audiotape, and I agree with whoever said Bates is perhaps not perfect for the part, although he's not bad -- but the music is wonderful and I would like to buy CDs of it. But which versions are best? Can a musician-reader tell us? This is the kind of audiotape to convince people audiotaped novels are a different animal altogether and judging from the comments of those who read the novel perhaps better than the print version of the novel. There is no way the novel could have captured what I am hearing on the audiotape. Maybe in our sophistication we're going back to more of an oral storytelling tradition?"
2,good headphones,"for the money they work good. I bought them for my grandson who is five he is hard on electronics, its a good item to buy and not spend alot of money"
2,Mini Blinds,"I recently purchased this item and was very pleased with the blinds. The delivery was right on time,and the quality is really good,considering they are vinyl. I would recommend this product to everyone. Very easily installed also."
2,No words can describe this book or Lucien,"Each book gets better and better but this one was the best!!!! I've read it twice and will read again!!! I wish there were more Lucien's in the world..wow talk about HOT, funny, suspense and just damn good u can't put down! Danielle u need to write another series about 4 other brothers u rock!"
2,"A little disapointing, but still good","...I had been waiting for this book since the end of the forth grade. When it finally came out, I was so glad. I read it and thought, 'this book isn't all it's cracked up to be' it was still good though. If I could rate the books in order, they would be Goblet of Fire, Order of the Pheonix, Scorcerer's stone, Chamber of Secrets, and Prisoner of Azkaban."
2,A Must Have!!!,I have not stopped listening to this CD since I purchased it---every song isgreat. If you like pop---you'll love this set of tunes!
2,Love it.,Added to our emergency kit. It is easy and simple to use. The light is bright. Nice to combine this with a few solar lights so there are multiple options in a prolonged power outage.
2,Some great ideas,I was impressed with the details of their suggestions. We start practice in a few weeks and I'm anxious to try some out. In real life the defenders are never where an opponent charts them to be so would have preferred they just be left off the diagrams.
2,Excellent first book for me.,"I bought this book from my neighborhood store I actually picked it up twice before laid it back down. Several days later after reading several reviews I picked it up again and bought it and I'm so glad I did. An all around fun and enjoyable read for me. Carly Litton and Matt Converse excellent main characters, but what drew me in were her secondary characters Sandra and Matt's younger sister I enjoyed all of them. The animals were excellent and I'm so pleased that she took Marcia's little dog in. My only quibble was Donkey-Man I wish she could have explained his history a little more. I will not review the story you will have to read the book yourelf, but if you enjoy excitement, humor ,action and suspense read this book. I will be looking for more of her books."
2,WOW! Some of the best christmas music you will hear!,"All of Carman's music is brilliant, and this is no exception! As usual, he combines all music styles which he does with equal flair. He sings with passion, and tells the gospel story as no one can. This is a mix of old carols (We 3 Kings) and originals. He uses top-notch back-up singers and players, and does a great Elvis imitation. This will make you want to get up and dance as well as worship. Add this to your collection."
2,Powerful!,"I have read the original ""The Case for Christ"" and was very pleased to see an edition written for teens. Although this edition is shorter it is written in a stimulating format using numerous windows and charts, none of the powerful defenses for Christ are lost. This book demonstrates that Christianity is not just another religion to choose from, but a belief based on facts, history, and logic. With the culture our youth are living in today, I believe this book will help our teens and preteens strengthen their faith, and motivate them to defend it."
2,Brain Age 2 Review,I purchased the Nintendo DS for each of my three adult children for Christmas. I saw the Brain Age 2 game advertised on tv and bought three. The game is interesting and fun for everyone of all ages. I'm glad I got it.
2,Great,Item arrived as described and in perfect condition. Great movie and Kevin James is always a pleaser. Wooluld def do business with again. Thanks.
2,From Total War to Total Diplomacy: The Advertising Council and the Construction of the Cold War Consensus,QUICK SHIPPINNG NICE DEAL!IT IS A NICE PURCHASING EXPERIENCE WIHT AN OVERSEA DEALER!GOOD DEAL! I WANT TO INTRODUCE OTHERS TO AMAZON!
2,"Great sculpt, not the best action figure","This is a great looking toy with a nice paint job, good detailing and a nice rubber cape. There aren't a great number of points of articulation, though. The knees and elbows don't even bend, and the arms and legs only swing to and fro. This toy's strength is that it remains true to how the character originally appeared in the Kingdom Come comic. Unless you're wedded to the idea of getting a Kingdom Come toy, I wouldn't recommend this. There are better action figures out there to play with."
2,PERFECT for my Maltese Puppies!!!,This heating pad is absolutely perfect for my Maltese puppies! It has a chew proof cord and stays at a constant perfect warm temp. My other pads shut off and had to be turned on again and I hated it because I always worried it would auto shut off in the night and the puppies would get chilled. This one stays on until you unplug it. It's nice size. My 7 pound female and her puppies all fit on it. I just slide it under the blanket... works great and I'm buying more!
2,Health Valley Packaging,I've ordered these cracker over 15 times in 3 years. The product arrives inside an Amazon box with a manufacture's corrugated box inside containing 6 boxes of cracker. 90% OF the crackers in all 6 boxes are broken in half. Except maybe once last year. The original shipment needs to be inspected or the manuf. (Health Valley) needs better boxes. The crackers are broken in stores too.Otherwise my son likes the crackers and eats a tray of them for school lunch every school day. Great product. Could be 5 stars.
2,It is what it is,This is a heavy duty splatter screen ... it's better than the usual window-screen type splatter screens because it's easier to clean and the handle folds away. It probably does a little better job of actually keeping the oil off the cook top but nothing's going to eliminate splatter completely.
2,Good Investment,This cooler serves it purpose. It would be better if it had a side handle but it is very convenient. Makes a perfect gift for someone in the office.
2,One of best games from Sega,"This game is FUN! Great to play with friends, seems a little complex at first, give it some time and you will fall in love!"
2,"Excellent product, excellent price","At first, I though it should have any kind of failure or I couldn't be so good for the price, but I was wrong, it's AWESOME, you can connect any playing console with this and get it online without any problem. I love this product!"
2,Incomprehensibly Comprehensible!,"I will share briefly. ALL YOU EVER WANTED TO KNOW ABOUT APOLOGETICS BUT WERE AFRAID TO ASK! Even for a novice, Geisler's book is simple but covers a range of Christian, philosophical and theological questions. And if that is not enough, a thorough bibliography is presented. If you only buy one book on apologetics, THIS IS IT! How DID he get all that stuff in there??"
2,Easy to Follow,"I gave this book only four stars as it was a little to basic for me. This was the only reason!There is lots of valuable information and it is very easy to follow the instructions to get the desired results/effects. Some things I had already learned either on my own, from another book, or from a two day Photoshop CS2 class I took.Would recommend to beginners or maybe beginner/intermediate looking to expand with fast tips.I bought ""Hacking Photoshop CS2"" use off of Ebay, Amazon has them new, but this book really paid for itself just in the first chapter of tweaking the Photoshop preferences, etc. Starts up noticiably faster on my laptop now! Would recommend that book highly for intermediates and up."
2,Stripped Down,"Great stripped down, sometimes bluesy rock. Jacks guitar and vocals over Meg's drums, while seemingly simple, are surprisingly intricate and moving. Songs offer a wide variety of themes and sounds, from dirty, garage style rock (""Dead Leaves and the Dirty Ground,"" ""I'm Finding It Harder to be a Gentleman."") to piano accompanied lounge music (""This Protector""). You might actually hear ""Hotel Yorba,"" a funky blues/rock number, once or twice on your local college station. If I had two pick two releases this year to buy, one would have to be White Blood Cells (with the other being the Strokes' Is This It?)"
2,History,"Great addition to my history collection. I seen several documentaries and read many books on Alexander.....no matter what i learn about him, he was still an amazing leader of men."
2,Entertaining and educational.,"Even if you don't operate your own business or manage other employees at the company you work, this book is a worthwhile read. This book is really about common sense and being prepared, whether it being for anything that could possibly go wrong or landing a top employee, business deal or managing your own personal finances. Being a sports fan and Packer backer helps, but is not necessary to understand as Wolf uses plenty of examples of some of his football decisions, how they were made and why and how they can be applied to your personal situation."
2,Canon weights,"Great products, the weights added provided perfect boyancy for my underwater camera and housing!! Should be good to go for scuba diving in Bonaire and Curacao!!"
2,massive,"...sprawling huge hulk of a sound that dismembers all traces of life found in its path-leaving only bones and teeth in its wake. this is the soundtrack to two snails f**king, or so says dylan carlson of EARTH fame, so that should tell you something. this feedback-laden , drone epic reeks of vile SLEEP and EARTH worship, though there is something going on here that puts them into their own. if you are into mammoth heaviness, massive amounts of distortion and feedback, or just pure decimation, check these guys out. theyre from japan, and it figures, this is drone taken to extreme levels of ferocity. killer."
2,"C""MPRELO YA!","Este es un disco imperdible, la interpretación de Leonard Bernstein de la Resurrección, es sencillamente EXTRAORDINARIA. La Filarmónica de Nueva York, esta en su mejor forma, Bernstein da todo el dramatismo que uno puede esperar en el primer movimiento, para llevarnos al cielo en el movimiento final al lado de los ángeles. Escuchar este CD es una experiencia fascinante y hasta religiosa. De hecho el Bernstein junto con Solti son los mejores interpretes de Gustav Mahler del milenio.Fuertemente recomendado.Francisco J. Muñoz (fmunozzzz@yahoo.com)"
2,K,"The book is great - it contains extremely creative ideas, and its like a big explosion of wild imagination. I felt I want more as soon as I unfortunately finished it - and I'll buy the next one as soon as it comes out!Twisted unusuall humour, hilarious violence and even in the bad situations - everything is psycothicly funny (like when max dies and turns into a soup in a lab).WARNING: you will become addicted.I never thought that the great SAM&MAX quest is based on this marvelous comics. Steve Purcell at his best."
2,Musicly strong but they are in need of a good lyrics writer,"I'll admit that the girls of Kittie are strong musicians and hold their ground to almost any guy (excluding the guys of Korn)and they WILL pave the way for other girl rockers (it's about time). But i gave them 4 stars because lyricly they aren't the most original, and at times they can seem a bit childish. But if they just work on that a bit more there will be no stopping them. A personal message to the members of Kitte- Keep doing what you are doing, you are proving that girls do belong in the rock music scene. You have all my respect. you are so much better than britney spears!!"
2,Jeff Larson changes style,"I had previously purchased two prior cds of Jeff Larson, and I must admit, I wasn't thrilled with his earlier work. I had heard him on an FM syndicated radio show playing his work acoustically, and really liked what I heard. Once he donned the electric guitar and was joined by his badn, I felt his music lost the crispness and clarity I had originally heard.But his new work has grabbed my attention. I found it on Amazon and listened to two or three tracks, and was amazed as the direction sounded much more along the lines of what I prefer personally. While somewhat more mellow, he still sounded contemporary and clear; there was a message to what he had to say. Swimming In The Make Believe has received repeated plays on my cd player, with many more to come."
2,fuzzy felt flowing freely from fluffy fretboards... duh,if you like felt you need this. but then again if you like felt you probabaly already have this. duh.. all songs are like buttah
2,Perfect way to learn Italian,"I was amazed by the quality of that software. I had doubts about learning a language with a software after taking a look at Rosetta Stone, which has no grammar, and is very repetitive with these 4 pictures, as well as other programs I bought at my local store...I saw a review and decided to give TeLL me More a chance. I was amazed by the technology aspect and how well designed it is. It comes with a free headset and microphone and it really helped with my pronunciation. I have family in Italy and they were also amazed at my progress.I also liked the cultural workshop as I was able to learn a lot of things about the Italian culture. I am at the Intermediate CD now and am confident I could have everyday conversations in Italian once I get to finish the Advanced level, rather than only know some sentences just useful for travel. My 2 teenagers are also using the software and it really helps them at school."
2,heart pan,"I love this pan. I baked mini tarts, mini pound cakes and other mini cakes in it. So cute and it baked evenly. I owned alot of Nordic ware and love baking from them. They are good quality pan. It feel heavy and made of good material."
2,Interesting Film,"It's very cool to see modern day miracles. I did have some trouble accepting some of it, or determining if it was a con trick (i.e. the gold dust and jewels), but the parts about healing stories were amazing. And Seeing the faith of so many individuals today was also encouraging to see."
2,A great slice of the 80s,"I was a big Red Rider fan back in the 80s, though most of my friends had never heard of them. Breaking Curfew has more of 80s pop feel to it, when compared to Neruda and As Far As Siam, but the songs still sound good today. I never got why these guys never made it bigger in the states.I rarely skip any songs on this CD, but some stand outs for me on this album are Young Thing Wild Dreams, Among the Ruins, Beacon Hill, and Hold Tight. Shake Monster, while certainly a piece of classic 80s cheese, is a fun listen, too.I assume if you're looking at this album you know what Red Rider sounds like. For those who do not, I would recommend this if you like the Outfield, Fixx, Cars, etc."
2,Outstanding! Buy it and listen to the magic.,"I had one of Ms McIlwaine's records (vinyl, long gone) some time ago. This CD compilation encompasses all that I had lost and then some. It is excellent in terms of sound quality and the material presented. Please check out her performance of Stevie Winwoods' ""Can't find my way home"".Truly excellent and indicative of the entire collection. Buy it and enjoy it forever."
2,More than adequate,"More than adequate for home use. Not too noisy and does a great job shredding. Only con is some of the bits of paper stick to the container because of static electricity. If you need to shred, buy it -- you'll like it."
2,Amazing Energy!,I have studied with other Reiki Masters and other healing methods as well. Steve's attunements are powerful and graced. I highly recommend them!
2,I like it!!,"Surprised this book was rated so poorly. I think it is a good beginner piano book, has some nice tunes/melodies."
2,Effective treatment protocols,"From a therapist's point of view it was encouraging to find a guide specifically outlining the most recommended and empirically based techniques for OCD. It has already been an invaluable tool in assisting several of my clients, even those who do not suffer from compulsions but just obsessions. It not only provides you with treatment modalities but also addresses issues/concerns from the client's perspective. So far it has been a positive asset to my library."
2,Getting to Understand People Better,"If you want to know people close to you better, this book is a very good reference material. After I finish reading this book, I will pass it on to my son who is a family counselor.This is another book I have been looking for and conveniently found in Amazon."
2,Readable!,"In order to keep this short and sweet, this is a very readable book about string, superstring theory, and branes! An excellent job by the author! Also contains references to nice music lyrics and quotes! Fantastic book, highly recommended!"
2,they fit over my medium framed glasses,"I have not road tested these yet as I'm not picking up my new helmet until Thurs. But, I did put them on and they fit well over my glasses and appear to be comfortable ( no wind sitting at my pc ). I chose these based on reviews for the same goggles with the tinted lens.I wish I could get the tinted lens without having to buy a second pair, but now knowing how well they fit I think I'd rather carry two pairs around with me than take a chance on the more expensive ones with the three interchangeable lenses."
2,A romantic ride into the shadowlands,"Scott Spencer may be one of our finest literary sherpas to the shadowy territory that lies between the love story, the mystery romance and the ghostly fable. His stock in trade is atmosphere, rich characterization and plotting a beguiling narrative that reveals as much to the reader as about the reader. His novels work as mirrors in which we see ourselves. WAKING THE DEAD is no exception to this rule, but it is exceptional in many other ways. This a novel to treasure for long, chilly nights by the fire (or to recreate them in the subway). Reading Scott Spencer is an intimate act and this novel, as most of his work, will take you far away and remind you that sometimes, if you get lucky, nothing is what it seems, specially trade paperbacks."
2,megamug,Used this mug in -India for 4 months...saved my life...made coffee every am with the french-press...and could fit 5 of their regular chais in the mug...best mug ever
2,one of the best,"This is my first Ani Difranco record, i kinda just jumped on the bandwagon. I saw her in concert last night and she is so awesome!! One of the best concerts ive ever been to. there really is no one quite like her, and there will never be another like her. Revelling is more upbeat and has the full band. My favorite song off of this is ""Marrow"". its the 4th song she performed and is a beautiful and well crafted song. Reckoning is just her and her guitar, and the chemistry is indescribable (or is it UNdiscribable? i dont know) the best song on this one is the title track. This is the perfect album for the new ani fan as myself. since then i bought two of her other records, ""Little plastic Castle"" and ""To the teeth"". this one is the best of the three in my opinion. maybe the other ones have to grow on me. i dont care how you get this cd, just GET IT."
2,Air powered Caulk Gun,"This is a great gun. It is quiet and delivers the caulk in a smooth manner. The one problem that I had was that the caulk that I used was old and so when the trigger was released, the caulk kept coming out of the tube. Even when I removed the tube from the gun!!Again, this gun did the job."
2,Magical Mystery Tour,"There are some really good tunes on here. Magical Mystery Tour is a pretty standard Beatles song. Fool On The Hill is good, too. The real highlight on the album is Lennon's Strawberry Field's Forever, which is a masterpiece.Bluejay Way is one of those psychedelic songs from the era, and it's a nice piece by Harrison. How could you not like I Am The Walrus? Closing out the record is All You Need Is Love, which was the anthem for a decade...need more be said?"
2,Reads like a movie script but it's still fun!,I'll have to agree with many of the reviewers that the writing isn't spectacular but the story line is still fun! This is an easy to read book and makes for the perfect type of read for a plane ride or vacation! I hope they make this into a movie -- it was great fun!
2,Good Movie,We totally enjoyed this movie. The Grandchildren also liked watching it with us. Costumes were beautiful. I don't have anything else to say but need more words for this review.
2,A Real Page Turner,"Set in the late 1800's, this who-dun-it evolves around the Boston Beaneaters Baseball Team. Using real people and events this book of fiction is recommended not only for mystery lovers, but for baseball fans."
2,Enjoyable....,"I enjoyed this movie because it makes you laugh and it makes you angry due to the behavior of the 20 somethings in the movie and toying with peoples trust and affections as well happens so much in today's society. No wonder so many people are turning to the same sex when these games are played. I do recommend this movie, it has party scenes, male players and female players that use and abuse other peoples affections, not for the emotionally squeemish."
2,Papasan Cradle swing,"I could not be happier with the purchase of this swing except I wish I had ordered it when my grandson was born. This swing is excellent quality, and shipping was maybe 2 or 3days, very fast! This swing is very sturdy, no tipping or wobbling, and is just really neat, from the lights to the sounds. It is a real life saver if you have a spoiled baby that wants to be held all the time! Definitely recommend this product to anyone with or expecting an infant."
2,Great Job,"Tried all the liquid products, they didn't work , don't waste your money..GET THIS !It Worked awesome !!! You'll have a bad hair day though with all the steam, put a fan behind u !!"
2,The Wire is Hot!,"The Wire's Second season takes on a new twist w/ the shipping business. The old characters are still great and the new characters add a different ""feel"" to the story. There is a lot of back stabbing going on between the characters so you have to watch carefully to get the ""whole story."" I am looking forward to Season 3 to see what happens next."
2,Good deal,"I'm satisfied with the product. However, it appears that the finish was botched in more areas that I would have liked on the shelves as well as the frame.While it fits most books and binders, you will have a hard time placing some portfolios on it."
2,Great costume. The hat disappointed me.,"This costume is cool. The hat disappointed me. It did not have a high top like the picture described. It did not stay on my head. The fabric of the hat was too delicate to handle, so I had to wear a different hat. I wore a hillbilly hat that matched the hat described in the picture, and I was able to decorate it with fabric and make the costume stand out more. Other than that this costume is great."
2,Straight Up Old School Wu,This CD passed the test at a party last night. Straight up old school Wu hits you from the start of this and doesn't let go of you.Track 8 shook things up and track 14 kept us goin.This one is worth the $15.Hook it up.
2,Perfect size,"We bought one of these to haul around audio/visual equipment for when we conduct meetings, conferences away from our office. It's well made with a very deep interior and removable tray.When empty, one person can pick it up but as soon as you start to load stuff into it, you'll need an extra set of hands to load it into your vehicle and and to unload it.Great box and we'll probably end up getting at least a couple more."
2,Not Meant to be Taken Seriously,"I wonder if the original reviewer has read this book. I see no reason for such outrage. :) I was given a hardcover copy of this book as a gift and found it to be an amusing reprint of vintage etiquette, NOT a modern book trying to get women not to swear! I would love to give it as a gift, as I received it, and would choose as the recipient a woman with a sense of humor about social niceties/feminism or someone who enjoys vintage books. This is a ""reprint of the 1933 ""Modern Debutante's Bible"" of jazz-age etiquette."" (Alibris)"
2,A Surprisingly Good Movie,Antwone Fisher is a surprisingly good movie in light of its unlikely subject matter. Most movies centering around psychologically troubled persons that are not crime dramas are just simply not very good. Antwone Fisher rises above the rest and is a very good movie.The reason for this is that the movie is an autobigraphy of a real life person. Antwone Fisher served in the U.S. Navy and had a productive relationship with a Navy shrink played by Denzel Washington.This movie boasts an excellent script and cast to match.
2,Improved sound for a good record,"It's surprising that both ""Seventh Dream of Teenage Heaven"" and ""Express"" will only be reissued in Europe, and not the United States. Love & Rockets have never been popular in Britain, we need these CDs HERE!This edition consolidates 4 fairly different remixes from 3 different markets. (UK, USA, Canada). It doesn't include the (superior?) US mix of 'Dog-End of A Day Gone By', a major oversight. Oops! The budget for 'remastering' the album may not have been high - the new sound is louder but not as detailed as I hoped. That said - it sounds far better than the old mid-'80s CD master.The real test will be the remastered ""Express"" - a much more exciting album. Except for 'Inside the Outside', most of this album is slow-tempo in the Bauhaus style, with a small hint of the 'poppy' melodies they would soon adapt. Still, a good record from a band that seems to be slipping through the cracks in recent music history."
2,"Good idea generator, need more detailed photos","Good basic technical information. Provides a nice overview of modification possibilities. Gives the reader a lot of ideas to build upon. Does a good job of explaining ramifications of modifications (good and bad) and why some are necessary (for example, structural/frame mods). The only thing I did not like was the lack of color photos throughout. Often I had to look at the black and white photos several times to discern details in the parts I was viewing. The photos were often too dark (most likely from the printing process) and lacked the necessary contrast to identify details I was interested in. I think higher resolution color photos would have helped."
2,nice,"this is probably on the top of my music lists i love almost every song except for like sugar~ and dance~, other than that its a great cd and patrick is hot (im not gay but i think i am now AHAHAHAH)"
2,Love me some Ken Follett books!,"I have truly enjoyed reading Ken Follett books. My favorite book EVER was ""The Pillars of the Earth."" The only negative thing I could say about ""A Dangerous Fortune"" is that it was a bit formulaic and predictable. Still, I really enjoyed the read."
2,"Really, really beautiful writing",I loved this book! The only reason I gave it 4 stars is the ending. But the rest of the book and characters are so beautifully written.
2,Awesome Disney Movie,"A great Disney movie, the music is wonderful, I watch it over and over many times"
2,Wonderul!!,The Sears family writes the most informative easy to read books out there. As a new mom I am so thankful for the concise information. Thank you!!
2,Get started with Dreamweaver in no-time,"I was really impressed with the lay-out and full page color pictures as the main learning element for dreamweaver. This breaks down step by step all the things neccessary to begin building your very own webpage, and is perfect for novices.Although I found this book perfect for someone only starting out using dreamweaver, if you want a more complete, detailed description of html, or other elements inside dreamweaver, don't choose this book. But if you are just starting out, this is a perfect way to learn. Using full page color pictures rather than confusing computer talk is a lot faster. I recommend this book in conjunction with another detailed book once you become an advanced user."
2,Xmas gift,I ordered this for my husband for Christmas and Amazon had it the cheapest by far and my husband was so excited when he opened it. He loved that it was a really nice book with pictures and facts from the movies and it has a slot for Skyfall already.
2,Very fun from 4+ months,"This was a hit with my first child and will be soon brought out of storage for my second. It has lots of things to keep kids engaged and continues to hold their interest for a long time. I only gave it 4 stars, however, because it is HUGE."
2,Worth the price,"The shotgun shell holder does exactly what i expected it to do. It does move around a little (Just a little) when loading or unloading shells from it, but not enough to really matter."
2,Lost Classic,"Wherever the members of Riverside may be today, they can be sure that they have left a pretty, heartfelt album behind, doomed forever to used cd stores and the luckiest of collections. Listen to the longing in songs like ""Careful Light"" or ""Cinnamon Eyes"" and you will see a band that had promise, if only they were given the chance to succeed. If you happen upon this CD, pick it up... you won't be sorry."
2,7th Heaven,"My son has Down's Syndrome and he migrates from one subject to another in videos but only after COMPLETELY saturating his mind with ALL content of the video. This is why I appreciate videos like 7th Heaven that is a clean show. He is now on his 2nd season of 7th Heaven (and I'm sure will continue to others until he has them all). Prior to these, it was wrestling - P U L E E S E!!!!It's such a change to switch to 7th Heaven.Thank you for fine videos like these."
2,"Smells great & cleans good, too","I really like this product. It isn't harsh like other bathroom cleaners. I didn't have to open all of my windows to clean the bathroom! The scent reminded me of baby wipes... Cleans very well. Great for wintertime (or bathrooms without proper ventilation.) Works good on bathroom floors, sinks, and outer rim of the toilet, also... :) Your bathroom will smell and feel clean, without the harsh odors of bleach. Love it!"
2,A MUST-Read!,"""You can shoot all the Bluebirds you want, but remember, it's a sin to kill a MockingBird"" This is the most important phrase in the book. It explains the title and the main moral and lesson of the book. This novel is about a lawyer, Atticus Finch, who is to defend a black man accused of raping a white girl in the 1930's. The story is told by Scout, Atticus's daughter. She tells of the trials her and her brother Jem have to go through as this case goes on. As the trial winds down, Tom Robinson, the black man, is found guilty of a crime everyone knew he didn't commit. The quote relates to Tom. This book is a great addition to anyone's library. This novel will leave a mark on your soul! While I'm at it, let me mention two other lesser-known but worthy Amazon picks that I enjoyed: WILL@epicqwest.com by Tom Grimes, The Losers' Club by Richard Perez -- two lively, fun novels that were an interesting change of pace for me. :o)"
2,Gameboy Advance SP........,"I think the Gameboy Advance SP is a great handheld videogame console. The things that I love most about it are the clamshell design, the backlighting(so you can see your games now) and the built-in lithium-ion battery(all you have to do is charge it up and you're ready to go). All these things combined make this one sleek system. One that will continue to dominate even when everyone else comes out with their handheld systems. Why? Lots of reasons. Like the fact that it's alot more affordable to get and the games for it don't cost you an arm and a leg(mostly in the $25 to $35 range depending on what games you get for it). Beyond that, there's a huge library of games for it as well as a huge back library of games(from the original GB up to the GBC). That said, I urge all those who's thought about getting one to get one. You'll be glad you did, trust me. It's more than just a handheld SuperNintendo system. Check it out and you'll see what I mean."
2,Why Discontinued???,"I cannot believe this product has been discontinued! I bought it last year when my trusty old regular Venus broke after several years and was instantly smitten. The vibrations make it feel like an electric razor. I think it does a great job, better than the regular one (which is a big compliment). It's also very lightweight, a trait of the Venus line. I decided to buy a second one to put away for vacations but had a hard time finding it. I have been lucky to find 3 or 4 on clearance racks since and bought them up. Another great prouduct with a short life span, but I am happy I found the ones on clearance."
2,An audio joy,This singer is a pleasure to hear with her rich and communicative voice. You have to love it!
2,America's Heros,"As a country we seem to forget all of the men, woman, and children who's lives are drastically changed or taken by war. History repeats itself, and this book should be an inspiration to our youth to change the pattern. I am proud of my Uncle Jack for putting his thoughts and emotions out there for the whole world to judge. Honor all of our brothers and sisters who stand up for your rights by giving up their youth or holidays with their children. My Grandma passed away only 7 months prior to the books release, but those who knew her loved her. She and my Grandfather raised 8 childern, all who I am proud to know.They are surely smiling down on Jack now!"
2,Great Fun!,"This game is really fun, except if you've already beaten a lot of the levels and can't get the others. But, all in all, I whole-heartedly recommend this game for Game Boy gamers."
2,MUCH BETTER THAN TARANTINO,"Tarantino doesn't have even half the creativity and originality the director of this movie had. This British production is very good, you care about the characters."
2,"""It all good""","This was my first time reading author ""Karen Kingsburg"" - Even Now. This book is somewhat parallel to my life and daughter, which we both were involved in a teenage pregnancy. The difference were the parents of hearing of their children news and just thought about themselves and not their child.We all go through trails and tribulation in our lives, but you must keep ""God"" and have faith in the Lord to see you through - good or bad!This is an excellent book and recommends for mother, father, sister or brother to read."
2,THE 'LEFT BEHIND' SERIES,I HAVE ALREADY READ THE FIRST SIX BOOKS IN THIS SERIES AND AM TRUELY TAKEN IN BY THEM. I COULDN'T PUT THEM DOWN! I FELT LIKE I WAS LIVING THE BOOKS. FOR THE FIRST TIME I FEEL LIKE I UNDERSTAND WHAT REVELATIONS IS ALL ABOUT. I FEEL TIM LAHAYE AND JERRY JENKINS HAVE REALLY DONE THE GREATEST JOB OF ANYONE IN TELLING THE STORY OF THE END TIMES TO COME. PLEASE HURRY AND GET THE SEVENTH BOOK ON THE SHELF BEFORE MY MIND EXPLODES WITH THE NEED TO READ ON AND ON. WAS IT WHO I THINK IT WAS THAT SHOT THE ANTICHRIST? CAN I GET A TIDBIT OF WHAT COMES NEXT?
2,Great product in design and functionality,"The Blender not only has a great design (as all KitchenAid products do have) it has also a very good quality. This blender is an excellent addition to our other KitchenAid products especially they fit nicely having them in the same color.Amazon does a great job with in shipment. Most of the time the packages arrived before scheduled arrival date, plus shipments are mostly cheaper than somewhere else."
2,Sea Dogs A epic story of a pirates life,"I think this is one of the best rgp/pirates games i have ever played. The rich 3d graphics make you feel like you are a true sea dog. Plenty of action, and you can pick a country to fight for, french,english, or spainish. Or fight for yourself as a pirate.Take over ships you board,or storm into a port after you destroy it. I love to plunder and there is plenty of that in this game. Dont wait for Seadogs 2 buy this one. I have played Seadogs 2 and it wasnt as good as the first one......."
2,True Marian Keyes!,"I got hooked by ""Lucy Sullivan is Getting Married"" and have been hooked since! In ""Anybody Out There,"" Keyes explores how we cope with tragedy. I felt so compelled by the character, and saw so much of myself in her. I don't want to give too much away about her tragedy, Keyes doesn't even tell until midway through the story, but it was like a bombshell went off! I think she does a great job of having you feel anger and sadness with Anna. I was definitely a big fan! Can't wait for the last of the Walsh sister novels!A definite must read if you like Keyes!"
2,Love this game,"Everyone we have introduced this game to has had a wonderful time playing it. Definitely recommend it for a fun, social, easy to learn game for 2 or more people."
2,Perfect price,I can't say if it worked or not but we needed this floatation vest for my 1 yr old we were going on a boat trip. everyone thought it was cute and we recieved no questions from the cost guard.
2,A tasty cereal,Puffed Kamut is a very good cereal and it has no salt which is wonderful for those of us on a low salt diet. I love it with a sliced banana.
2,Viral Factor,definitely an interesting movie about germ war fare it was a good watch a very action packed movie i recommend it
2,Not a Godzilla movie.,"My opinion is that this was not a movie about Godzilla, but rather a movie about a kid who watches Godzilla movies! The worst one, but great fights!"
2,I was a bit disappointed...,"I have the old edition of The Well-Trained Mind and just received the revised edition. It has been a great book overall, but I was hoping for more information on different classical curriculums offered out there. They also took out the books they recommended for history and grammar (in the grammar stage) and inserted the books that they have written. I thought that was a bit biased and very self serving on their part. They should have recommended their own books, but also included others as good alternatives. There is not as much change to the book as I had hoped."
2,rock on!,"John Taglieri has put years of life and love into this CD.From the opening chords of the title track 'Leap of Faith', John draws you in with his vocal stylings and massive guitar tracks. 'High Road"" puts into words the way we all feel at the end of a relationship...and he does so with such skill and charismathis is a definite must-have for anyone who longs for the return of real rock n roll"
2,The Private Lives of Pippa Lee,"Interesting regarding the mind's abilities of how we perceive where we are in life at different times of life.Acting by Robin Wright was convincing and there were several interesting characters in the movie. Keanu Reeves played an integral part of Pippa Lee finally coming to terms with herself and life as it is. He was cast appropriately and did a good job. Most of the casting of characters was very good/appropriate.Overall, we enjoyed the movie..."
2,Way Better Than Expected,"First off, I am not a Zombie movie fanatic at all. I never got into the whole zombie thing, but my sister had this movie from netflix so I watched it with her. I had no previous opinions about this movie and I don't know how much more pleasantly suprised I could have been. The storyline was original and extremely entertaining. The casting was perfect. Woody Harrelson in his most fun role since Natural Born Killers.And to top it off probably one of the BEST cameo appearances EVER (I may be biased on that point since I am a HUGE HUGE fan).To sum it up, pick it up and I'm pretty sure most people would enjoy this very humorous film."
2,I've got carpeting throughout my house,"I've only had to replace this product once in the past three years. It holds up well, and the only reason it wore out this time is because my sister didn't notice when she sucked up a sock into the intake. I will say that it is a horrible smell when it melts. All in all, though, it is easy to install and a tremendous bargain compared to some products."
2,The Best Sports Book I've read,This book is one of the best books ive read in my life. Baically the story is about a young man Named Stevie Thomas That wants to be a Sports Reporter. In order for him to be noticed he has to win the competition aginst a girl that has a dad that knows many people. So she gets to interview all these people and he has nobody. S this story is mostly about him seeking for someone to interview.
2,EXCELLENT REFERENCE TO BIBLE CODES,This is a good general book for beginners in Bible codes for types and shadows. It is not an exhaustive reference but it will get you going in the right direction. It does give you and appetite for more reading and studying.
2,Amazing,"I can try to articulate the emotion that this singer brings out in her music but I will not bring her complete justice. Her voice is unreal, it sounds as if she is an angel, taking a listener to incredible hights before unreached. Each track is complete, in and of itself. Everyone should take a moment to appreciate such genuine genius talent."
2,Fun and faith,"Answer Manmanages to be both philosophically deep and lightheartedly funny at the same time. If you want to see a romantic comedy,Answer Manworks well. It has some funny scenes (including Jeff Daniels' monster collection) and the usual awkward romance. However, if you also like pondering the BIG questions,Answer Manprovides some interesting food for thought. It doesn't so much provide any meaningful answers as to suggest where to look for questions. Perhaps most important question is whether our lives are shaped by our choices or events that happen to us - or both."
2,just the begining!,"this is just the begining for cheech and chong. i own every dvd, record etc....as far as dvds, you can getup in smoke- the high-larious version (more bonus features)next moviethings are tough all overnice dreamsstill smokinget out of my roomfar out man-chongrude awakining-cheechborn in east l.a.-cheechA/K/A TOMMY CHONGi know they have a few other movies but not my style.now if we can only get these two back into the studio together!"
2,great item at a low price!,"I purchased this for my new 22"" tv...I was a little skeptical about the price being so low since these usually sell for $75 and up in discount stores. It ended up being a great purchase! It is made very well and worked great for mounting the tv in the corner of the room. It was also very easy to install...I did it myself and it hasn't fallen down yet haha!"
2,"HELLO SHE LIVED IT! They Made a Documentary about this Book,A KEEPER!","If you are an INDIE Producer, This Book has the Golden Chalice in IT. A No Friles Cover but who caresevery Page is Like Torn from the authors Personal Black Book. If you want to Survive and Thrive in FilmMaking.This Book will help Guide You through everything.I came from New York to Hollywood because of my Parentswere Bi Coastal.When Lynda Obst came out to Hollywood it was because of Her Ex Husband.I was with Neil Bogart and Casablanca Records.He warned me that Lynda was Super Bright and She was a Good Looking Chick.

Todate I think Lynda has Produced 19 Films and I can't count How Many TV Series.Betty White is forever grateful she met Her.This Book is a Manefesto. NO BS, IT COULD SAVE YOUR ASS.Whatever The cost, Just Buy IT!"
2,Fantastic book,Eragon is the book I say is Fantastic. Its by a kid that was therteen years old.His name is Cristopher Paolinis. The book is about a boy Fifteen years old. who was poor and lived with his uncle and cusin. One day he whent to the Spine to hunt. In the Spine he finds a blue stone. he brings it home and falls asleep. The rock starts shaking and a dragon cracks out of the rock.further in the book he becomes a rider and fights the king so every body can be free. If he survives and the war you have to read this owsome book
2,Unique singing voice is memorable,"I love the unique singing voice found in Editors. It's almost haunting sometimes. They lyrics are great and the music has true feeling to it, I can tell these people put a lot of time into their efforts.This CD is great for in the car, at home while working, chilling, or whatever. The songs are all different from one another, but tie into the overall band itself well. None are really boring or stale. It really is a worth-while CD."
2,A classic on the subject...,"This is a true classic, the first book to really cover watercolor pencils in depth. It's in my own library, and I wrote Watercolor Pencil Magic!I didn't end up using the crush up pencil tips and paint technique in my book, because it seemed like an uneccesary step in the creative process, but Greene's paintings are beautiful and inspiring!"
2,A TRUE LAYMAN'S UNDERSTANDABLE STORY,"MR. LAUGHLIN HAS CAPTURED THE ESSENCE OF THE LIFE OF THOMAS MERTON, HIS COURAGE, HIS IMAGINATION AND HIS FORTITUDE.IT IS A MUST FOR ANYONE, YOUNG OR OLD WHO IS LOOKING FOR A HERO."
2,EXCELLENT,The most accurate portrayal of the life of a firefighter! No words describe how real life and touching this movie is. a MUST HAVE!
2,Very Good,"Product was shipped and receieved as expected. Exactly what I was looking for.Very good very good very good. I need to write 20 words here in order to submit this review. Yes, good product, good quality, and good experience."
2,Yes it's different - but she likes it!,"Yes, this is a different format. But it is still the same concept - teaching children basic ideas. And my daughter loves it."
2,Not even a country fan,"I like all kinds of music, but I grew up as an alternative fan from the 70's...Yes, ELP, David Bowie, but I also loved Jackson Browne, The Eagles and Motown. This past summer I was flipping channels and came across a Country Music show. Gretchen Wilson was singing Red Neck Woman and it caught my ear. Next came Keith Urban and I was blown away by his personality and guitar playing that came across on screen.Based on the reviews I decided to order Golden Road. I LOVE it. Every song on the cd is good, and I find myself humming the lyrics. Then I purchased Be Here...it's great too.I noticed a fan website last week and checked it out only to find that Keith Urban is in LA this week. I booked tickets, then talked my husband into going:) I can't wait!"
2,"Good fun, but not quite as good as Casino Royale.",As an avid James Bond fan I feel that Daniel Craig's Bond is a terrific and more accurate portrayal of Ian Fleming's character. This movie is good fun and action packed - though not quite as good as Casino Royale.
2,Great Buy for Affordable Price,"We initially wanted to buy the Madison Crib or Storkcraft Aspen in Cherry. However, we wanted to get something reasonably priced since someone else was offering to purchase. Also, I didn't want to make a large investment and in one year change my mind on buying something new!!! This is a good resell item because it is a crib, daybed and full size bed assembly. I waited on DAD to put together and after a week it remained in the box. So, I decided to challenge the assembly of this crib for myself. IT WAS SUPER EASY!!! I followed the easy step by step instructions! Yes MOM did it!!! BEAUTIFUL!!! I kid you not I am very picky and meticulous when it comes to decorating and a major purchase. GREAT BUY for AFFORDABLE PRICE!!!!"
2,Really fun book,"My husband bought this a few years ago, and each of our children has loved it. It is a favorite at around 3 or 4 years old, when they want to feel like they are ""reading""; initially a few of the pictures require a little explanation, but after that they just love being able to read a whole book by themselves! The repitition of ""I love you!"" every few pages makes for a sweet story. A bedtime favorite at our house!"
2,Thinning shears,I was happy with my purchase of thinning shears and Amazon got the article to me in due time as usual.
2,Great way to pick up the ladies,"take this frisbee-wannabbee to the park, and teh ladies will come flocking with questions.don't use in windy areas. it will hurt someone."
2,Tangled,My 4 year old niece and I have movie night every Saturday night. Tangled was one of our favorite movies. We loved it!!! Thank you.
2,what are they waitin for?,"I was in france last summer and bought this cd and i loved it, i dont see why none of the critics agree with me, i had my copy stolen and i tried to buy it but it wasnt out yet, beleive me its a whole knew style that west coast fans can listen to continuesly. that lable needs to get things together and put this cd out. west coast aint playin."
2,Worx 18 volt battery for WG150 trimmer/edger,I bought a replacement Worx WA3152 18 volt battery from Amazon for my Worx Wg150 trimmer/edger. It arrived quickly and safely. It took a charge and works very good so far. It seems to be more powerful than the old one was when new.
2,OUTSTNDING!!!,"This is an excellent movie. Not a waste of time, but good entertainment!! Funny, suspensefull, interesting among other things. If you like George C. Scott you will like this movie. Women seem to like this movie and not many have seen it in recent years so a good movie for a single guys collection. No, realy I actually like this movie, but, you know... Romantic comedy with a little crazy to the whole thing, which makes it realy good. Get this movie!!"
2,Amusing Humorous and Educational,"Donald Monat and June Dixon give you a fascinating look at the history of the English language and how it is spoken today by the government, other countries, and even restaurants. I doubt anyone will find this satirical look at English as it was and is spoken dry. Though this is only available in Audio Book I can not imagine it in words because of music and all of the skits. I found this tape by searching for a book on English and was quite happy with it, as I am sure you will be."
2,Good!,Large staff. Easy to read and encouraging to play. Great tool for beginner. Looking forward to the upcoming CD. Would be perfect with it!
2,Work With Technology Instead of Against It,"Ms. Jasper presents excellent advice on how to use computers, software, personal digital assistants, and cell phones to better organize your life and overall provides very helpful suggestions for introducing sanity into what is for most of us a life in overdrive. This is a time management book that is relevant to the real world today, and has many effective techniques to get us where we want to go."
2,The Fruits of Labor,"Anyone who listened to Aesop's Daylight EP had to hear this coming. On Bazooka Tooth, day does, indeed, turn night. Gone is the hopeful afternoon ballad. This doesn't mean Bazooka Tooth will leave Aesop fans in the lurch, however. While there is enough Blockhead to sustain the interest of long-term fans (3 songs), the Aesop-produced tracks hit hard. No-holds-barred bass tracks shake down the city of brick this mason built, track-by-track, over the past five albums--Daylight, Labor Days, Float, and the out-of-print Music for Earthworms and Appleseed. This is Aesop throwing open the door to your house and sermonizing without without reserve. Five stars for pushing the envelope, once again."
2,Composer Sings His Songs,"Recorded in the Fifties at the now defunct Tally Ho in Hollywood, California, composer Matt Dennis plays and sings his wonderful compositions. In the background, we can hear the tinkling of high ball glasses and the ""oohs"" and ""ahs"" of pleasure at the talent of Mr. Dennis. Buy this delightful recording and you will find it's ""Happy Hour"" any time it's on your HiFi."
2,USBCELL AAAAA From me!,Aside from being a conversation piece this item works as advertised. Use'em charge'em...that simple...no more looking for the charger.
2,vtech notebook,This was a really good value. Both of my sons play with it and they are 2 and almost 4. My 2 year old doesnt really know what he is doing my the almost 4 year old is starting to get the hang of it. Good product though.
2,Worked for me,"Great product. super flashes shipping got it to my door in no time at all. If you need to print two sided biz cards and have a good printer, this is the product for you.would recommend."
2,Touched Emotions,"The year 2000 was heralded in with this song ""Can't Stop"" Album: Sleepless jacksoul""Can't Stop"" dealt with all the emotions that we experienced at year ending 1999.jacksoul lets us open our own thoughts to unwind all these pent up emotions, broken relationships and all the good reasons ""Can't Stop"" speaks to me. We all have questioned our mental health but we cannot let anyone know about this, we just can't stop being in love, with the occasion or the person or the job, our life. 2000 - 2001 Goal settings for a positive new millinum ""mindsets"".Can't Stop is now nominated for the Juno Awards in Canada at the Copps Colisium, Hamilton, Ontario Looking forward to root for ""jacksoul"" throughout this grand Celebration. March 2001.""CAN'T STOP"" jacksoul Album ""SLEEPLESS"" A MUST!!!"
2,AWESOME!,"Joy Whitlock's CD is so awesome...she played in Memphis, and I went to see her and got the CD...This CD is definitely worth the 8 bucks!!"
2,Functional with lots of outlets,This compact power strip is as stylish as a power strip can be. The power cord is long and has a flat 90 degree plug which is convenient when you are using an outlet behind the a couch or furniture.
2,This album will NEVER DIE!,"This was my first exposure to the music of Charly garcia. And what an album it is! This is one of those rare gems in which ALL of the songs are actually GOOD! Recorded in Brazil in 1987, cooperating with Garcia are well known Argentine and Brazilian artists Paralamas, Fabiana cantilo, and Luis Alberto SPinetta. A classic of the rock en espanol genre. Today the CD sounds a little dated, but the music will NEVER DIE! GRAB THIS ALBUM TODAY!PS: Stay Away from anything he ever recorded between 1991 and 2003. That's when he entered his kirk cobain phase: crappy music for foolish teenyboppers."
2,Good Sound,"I've owned this shelf system for over 5 years. Its a great system, especially for the relatively low price. Good range of sound, very little interference noise, good product for the price."
2,Good Story but slow,"I love Maeve Binchy as a storyteller. In fact, I am in the process of reading all her books. This one had a wonderful story, but was very slow in plot progression. I did enjoy it, but it probably won't be my favorite."
2,Adrenaline rush!,"A very satisfying, exciting story. Chris Stewart impressed me with his ability to convey the jet piloting experience in writing, so that the reader believes he is right in the officer's shoes. The scenario of biological warfare was quite creepy and believable. So what if the plot is familiar! I get back on rollercoasters I like. Finally, I was impressed with Mr. Stewart's ability to tell an excellent tale without expletives, sexual immorality, or excessive drinking. I will definitely be considering his other works. Have some fun and read this book!"
2,"Will not fit 15"" wheel","Appears to be a nicely made product but it says that it will fit 4 and 5 lug wheels. Will not fit 15"" wheel. Probably fine on 14""."
2,The Best Yoga book I have read!!,I have many books on Yoga and this book I am having a hard time putting down. Everything he says is so easy to understand and you are able to relate to each page. I decided to write this before I am even through with this book since I am so enspired by it! I can't say enough about this book!! Thanks so much for letting me see the true beauty of Yoga.
2,Magik 6 - Pure Magic!!!,"Hands down one of the greatest trance albums of all time, if not the GREATEST!!! Magik 6 is certainly an album to lose yourself in, and certainly never gets old. From start to finish the listener is encaptured with hypnotic beats and melodic rhythms, and would definitely make any clubber wish they were on the dance floor (especially at this live set from Amsterdam). Tiesto immediately grabs the listener with Afterburn's 'Fratty Boy' previewing what is entailed. Before the album reaches its peak half way through with the ever popular 'Silence' by Delerium, its introduced with 'Purple Cloud' by The Swimmer (very hypnotic). Cloud 69's 'Sixty Nine Ways' has one of the best breakdown/buildups I've ever heard, and Push's 'Til We Meet Again' is a track the listener will never forget. Not many other albums can compare to this, with the exception of Disc 2 of Paul Oakenfold's 'Resident: 2 Years of Oakey at Cream' Album!!! Love ya Tiesto!!!!!"
2,Miss Zukas helps her aged aunt untangle a lifelong mystery.,"While not as intriguing as some of the early books in this series, Miss Zukas checks in again in with an arresting tale involving an aged favorite aunt. As the plot matures, all regulars play their roles and the reader catches up on their lives. A further bit of Miss Zukas' love life is revealed and she seems not as straight laced and more vulnerable than previously. A good read, but, lacks the high interest level of the first titles."
2,It's the Best....,"I have loved this Clint Black album for a long time. I had the tape and thought I had lost it so I bought another one. Ended up finding it and then I had two and still bought it on CD. I know all the words to these songs and the CD version comes with an extra song that the tape doesn't. I think it's the greatest. Most CDs you buy, you end up only liking 1, 2 or 3 songs. I like all the songs and this is the only CD where I don't skip over a song to get to the next one."
2,Length of Roll is Not Correct.,"Measured and remeasured and should have had a few feet extra, but it seems instead of 5 yards (15 feet) each roll is about 13 feet. Had to order another roll...very inconvenient. Went up with no problem though and looks very nice."
2,Funny and Smart,"I got this book free from Pixel of Ink, as well as the first in the series (not necessarily written first, though). I'm ready to buy the rest of the series. Good entertainment, and Levine manages to keep his formula fresh. Besides, it makes me laugh; I love his nephew; and he plots well."
2,Beautiful Toy,As was said before this is not a small item. This is easily close to 3 feet long. Detail is everywhere like other items in this line. If you have a fancy for military collectibles and the room get this chopper. Not really good for young children as it probably wouldn't handle the beatings they give.
2,"excellent all around production; incredible, amazing 14pc band!","just go out and buy the bluray version...thanks for giving us the full show, unlike some other bands that EDIT/CUT etc...(i.e. Live, Live at Paradiso, maybe Ed is reading this); the fans want the whole show period!) Thanks Stevie!am still trying to tweak the audio settings....any audiophiles out there, am running a Denon 3803 w/ Martin Logans in front only..... via optical...lpcm vs d5.1 v dts??? have been trying to decide what offers the best clarity and sound ....also anyone AT the London show; verify who was playing the electric roland drum kit set up to SW keyboards????"
2,Loved it!,"I've got to say I LOVE this book! I am a postpartum doula and I'm always looking for information to share with the moms I see. This has it all. Now I not only can show them the Babinski reflex, but explain how the brain has changed when the reflex changes. There's so much in here I'm sharing with moms. Just can't say enough about this book."
2,A great investment!,"Being a great fan of the brothers grimms fairy tales, this book was one of the best investments I ever made. It has countless stories to read for both adults and children. This book translates really well and also has the original german titles in the back. It covers all the famous tales by the brother grimms ever made with great detail. It even has some drawings among a few tales that add well to this wonderful book."
2,I love this movie,"Lately i've been obsessed with this movie and so I ordered it online and i've gotta say, I love it, I totally recommend it if you like movies with singing and dancing in it :)"
2,A Maturing Midge Ure,"Answers to Nothing seemed to mark Midge Ure's desire to step out of his Ultravox shoes. Instruments besides the synthesizer are prominent on this CD such as his guitar, which screams without rage on songs ""Dear God"" and ""Just For You"" . The songs ""Take Me Home"", ""The Leaving (So Long)"" and the tearjerker ""Homeland"" wonderfully express Midge's love for his family.The only low point is when Midge whines on ""Hell To Heaven"" but he then makes up for it with another whiny song ""Lied"" which works beautifully. For the Ultravox fan who would buy this album, ""Sister and Brother"", the duet w/Kate Bush is as close to the Ultravox sound as Midge gets here...and thats pushing it.In conclusion, I highly recommend this CD and have spent many hours listening to it. Great musical effort!"
2,Excellent book!!,Pendergrast really brings the Coca-Cola story alive in his book. He tells the story of this amazing company in candid fashion. Highly recommended for Coca-Cola fans around the world!!
2,GREAT CD,"Holy **** this is a good CD! All toy instruments were used, but Self still manages to rock hard!"
2,Jack Lemmon,I saw this on TCM and bought this for my brother and his wife. I really like these old shows that I grew up watching..
2,I couldn't put it down!,A captivating story of not only survival but thriving in the heart of hell. I experienced sorrow and joy and triumph all through the eyes and soul of Edith Hahn. A wonderful story that makes the reader grateful for her own life of uneventful existence.
2,Get these programs before they are gone. They are Good.,"these cd rom programs are a great teaching tool for one to learn how to play the game of chess. it does not get any easier than this. i actually ordered the first one again along with the second part to fritz and chesster. why? because everything explained is in easy steps along with being fun at the same time. there are some reviews on here which say that everything is slow. everything is slow in the beginning because it is a story, and the cd rom program cannot be fast forwarded at all. just go through the story and get practice then one will be able to go to the arena and challenge chesster the rat. so these cd roms are recommended-part 1 and part 2.i got inspired to pick this up [this game] by reading on people such as pierre st. amant and howard staunton."
2,"This one's for the ""Good James""","First off, I would like to mention that the disgusting psychopath who pointed out that everyone who listens to Pearl Jam, Nirvana, and Rage Against The Machine is Satanic and Anti-Christ is NOT Mormon. In one of his other reviews he even mis-wrote the actual name of the church, which is The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Days, and said that Mormons are not Christians, which they are. What kind of sick, twisted person goes around trying to purposely degrade other people's religions, I don't know, but please don't confuse actual Mormons with Mr. Richardson.Anyway, on to the album. I'm a new fan of Pearl Jam, and this is the only album of theirs I've listened to so far. Over all, I really liked it. I'd give the songs ""Black"" and ""Garden"" five stars, definitely. ""Jeremy,"" ""Evenflow,"" and ""Release"" were also excellent.Thanks."
2,NOBODY KNOWS,As allways Mary Jane Clerk is a good writer and very esy to follow.Look forward to more reads and new books.
2,exactly what I was looking for,Was a perfect fit for the french press I broke. Was the cheapest one I could find on the internet and was shipped quickly!
2,A MASTER WORK,"It took me just over a week to finish reading Mr Kiernan's work. I had no idea who he was but was attracted by the cover and the title and, if I'm honest, Eric Hobsbawm's preface. This is the best-written and most educative history of our country and its wars that I've ever read. I finished school over a year ago and have been travelling the world. This amazing history taught me more than I'd ever learnt at NYU. This book should be on every history reading list. I'm not saying that I expect everyone to agree with its arguments, but simply in the interests of diversity and freedom of thought. I was educated on Professor Niall Ferguson's work (he, too, like Kiernan is a Scot!), but THE NEW IMPERIALISM was a wonderful antidote."
2,Not What You Think It Is,"This film is not one of those silly and insipid movies about young college kids getting drunk, and getting involved in stupid slapstick situations.It's about four girls who go on a spring break to Fort Lauderdale, expecting to find boys (which they do), but what happens is they end up becoming women. Delores Hart shines in the leading role as Meredith, a mid-western pharmacist's daughter who is already on her way to becoming a woman. Paula Prentiss and Connie Francis provide the comedy with their boyfriend's antics. Yvette Mimieux is the young gullible and overly-romantic girl who gets seriously involved, and then abused by a bunch of seemingly good handsome boys (who are nothing but thugs).Some parts of the movie are silly and stupid: the story involving Barbara Nichols, and Jim Hutton's infatuation with her. But that storyline isn't long enough to ruin the movie.The ending is not that predictable, but you end up feeling that these girls have grown into womanhood."
2,Ditto.,"Initially it is a slackened and sexy album. Probably the best makes-outside the album released since the semi one with late 70s. There inevitable comparison of will of the model of Lamontagne with Van Morrison. It is not a bad thing. Personally I would say that it is nice cross of Morrison, Otis Redding, and Bob Dylan, with some contemporary notes of the 21st century as well. Like lower result, its voice is strongly emotive and a perfect foil for the somewhat minimal and honest production on the disc. The album is uniformly excellent, and never monotonous. Its motionless growth on me, but feel Lamontagne of I has more remaining power than Jack Johnson, or any lyric writer of singer of this generation unless Elliott Smith (TEAR). Obtain on this album early, it is guaranteed to be sensational success. If all is well Lamontagne a long career will have. These songs are such a joy to test."
2,REAL music for all the Lilith children,"In an age where Jewel and Sarah McLachlan are hailed as Lilith Queens and phonies like Garth Brooks have ruined country music, it's no surprise that Freakwater are virtually unknown. The songs which comprise SPRINGTIME sound like a letter to Nashville saying, ""This is how it ought to be done."" Real, raw, melodic, heartfelt. Even if you don't like ""country music"" (and I don't), please give this album a chance.Memo to Sarah McL: PLEASE invite Freakwater to next year's Lilith."
2,Everything and more,The Off road has everything you want and more. The side pouches easily handle anything up to a 70-300 lense and the storage for accesories is massive. The belt pack assembly or the use of shoulder strap make carrying easy whether hiking or walking through town. You can't go wrong with this.
2,Awesome ! Awesome ! Awesome!,Ive only used the sticker part of this machine but I made yard sale signs with cut out letters from my Cricut & the Xyron making stickers out of the letters. I didnt have to spend hours coloring bubble letters with stinky permanent markers ! Soo worth it already ! Cant wait to do laminating & magnets ! Buy it !!!
2,Great Pound Cake Pan,I baked a homemade pound cake in this pan for Thanksgiving and got so many compliments on how pretty it looked and how good it tasted. The cake cooked very evenly and had a bakery perfect form. I will be using this pan in lieu of all my old Bundt cake pans from now on. It reminds me of my early years in my grandmother's kitchen during her baking moments.
2,Great work horse!,"Bought this product for our church. Use it every week, sometimes more than once. It's a good size and easy to carry from the storage cabinet to the sink to fill with water. Everyone likes the coffee, and we are very pleased with this coffee maker. Would recommend it to anyone or organization that needs to make a large quantity of coffee."
2,Funny as hell,"Bizarro! episode was my favorite but I bought seasons 1-4 and have enjoyed everyone of them equally. Besides, if you buy Season 1 and you laughed then buying Season 2 won't be too far out of line. However, if you bought seasons 1 & 2 then what's stopping you from finishing it off and buying 2 more seasons?"
2,Great Game,"As other have said is hard to use the wii control with this game but if you have a game cube controller then everything is great, certainly you can't use the d-pad just the analog stick but for me that was more than enough. This is a must have for everyone that have played metal slug arcade series"
2,Great nuker!,"I wanted to purchase this at Wal-Mart, but they quit carrying it. It was a bit more on this site for shipping, but it was worth it. It works very well, easily, and is nice looking. I don't use the toaster much, but have a few times, and it works just dandy. I'm very happy with this machine. (LG makes a more expensive but less powerful one, btw.) I'm real happy with this purchase and would buy again. I've had it for about 3 months now I think."
2,Great little corkscrew,"I'm not sure what product the previous reviewer is talking about, but the one I have is nothing like what he describes. Mine doesn't have any mysterious protrusions or sharp bits of metal anywhere. I think it's an excellent little corkscrew with a good feel and a nice design."
2,great for price,"the price is great for a product with so many features. I paid much more for my previous breadmaker which recently quit. I average using this product every 2 weeks. So far the bread texture is wonderful and the bagels are unbeatable, Thanks for an affordable product!"
2,Perfect and ordering more!,"I purchased these when I began taking care of my elderly in-laws and find it very convenient to get thier pills ready and sit out a "" day"" on the counter each morning for them! I have read that the pill cases are slippery, but I didnt see a problem with that. I also read on the reviews that the items lid is heavier than the base and its hard to fill...maybe its cause I'm a nurse and give pills for a living, lol...but I found it not a problem to fill. I also read people saying that it was hard to give pills in the am if there were pills for pm due to no lid on each side...I hold one finger over the pills in the pm and turn the item over and never have once lost one in the shuffle...SO...I bought enough for two weeks worth of pills and am ordering more tonight so I can have a month ready at one time! Tried many other types of packaging and decided to go with these and toss the rest in the garbage!"
2,the second episode,"I missed this on tv, so I bought it off amazon live. It's a good early episode in this hit show. The only complaint I have is that the show doesn't have any customed villians. Well one that is on the island. But the green arrow is only as good as his villians and he needs more radical villians. And the press would have dubbed this guy the arrow or green arrow, not the vigilante. That's what they do. Minor faults in a great show though. This is a well acted show too. Top notch."
2,Actually works perfectly out of the box,"I was amazed. On my home network, streamed very high quality (though small picture, since the TV signal is actually less than 640x480), and when I went wireless, the quality dropped (as expected), but it kept up with audio, didn't break up. Really amazingly well designed wizard to configure."
2,Business Savvy with a twist,"Finally a humorous take on the business world with both feet firmly planted in truth. Cantor brings humorous light to real world issues without making a mockery of them. Each page provoked thought and laughs. Don't read it too fast or you'll be sorry its over. Great takes, funny phrasing, suprisingly deep, you'll like it!"
2,Classic,"I loved this book as a child, so when my brother had a baby this past year I thought it would make a good gift. It was harder to find that I thought, but my nephew is just getting to the age where 'reading' is a good activity. Well worth the search. How much you're willing to pay for a copy is just up to you."
2,Amazing book...,"I have been using ""Hypnotize Yourself As You Read"" for weight loss and it really works! I have lost 8 pounds in the first week and it was amazingly effortless. I have NO CRAVINGS for sweets or ""bad foods"" I can go grocery shopping or out to eat and never crave food that's bad for me. I'm not hungry until it's time to eat a meal...which I eat slowly and thoroughly enjoy. I no longer eat just to eat, or when I'm bored. I have tried everything there is to lose and this is the first time I feel that I am in control!The book is also very helpful to anyone who needs a little help with life's problems...I will use this book until it falls apart! Buy this book....you won't regret it!"
2,A very special haunted house story,"This is a terrific paranormal romance, with plenty of passion. I recommend it to all readers of erotic romance fiction, whether or not ghost stories are your usual fare. The author brings the setting alive, drawing readers into the story. I've read all of Dee S. Knight's books, and this is one of her best."
2,Primordial Pop.,"Check this one out. The lyrics are pop influenced, the music drives unbelievably hard. Amazing guitar effects wrap around strong vocals all backed by a very solid rhythm section. The songs vary from the slightly psychedelic opener ""Still The Same"" to the straight ahead modern rock ""Kou-Coo."" My favorite songs: ""Codie Clear"" and ""Kou-Coo."""
2,I look forward to working out,"So far i like it. I always heard people say things about exercise tapes about how they look forward to working out and i always thought i did too whenever i went walking, but i think i do even more so now. All the different moves keep your mind interested rather than just zoning out like with walking. It doesn't involve as much dancing as i figured it would from the infomercials but i still like it. Someone said they thought the music was great on this tape but i only like the cool-down music in them. But everyone is upbeat and slap-stick happy so they keep you motivated!"
2,Highly Recommend,This book was highly recommended to me by friends and it arrived on schedule in great shape. It was priced right. No complaints.
2,Provides an understanding of that feeling in the pit of your stomach,"Read this book twice I loved it so much. Use the ""fill in the blanks"" technique when Steven (The Author) uses examples of his profession of writing with your own profession. It will make even more sense reading it this way."
2,Great!,I've been using Mother's Milk Tea since the birth of our son 14 month ago...and it a wonderful product! I include a box in all my newborn gift baskets! Highly recommended!
2,Not bad But Not Great,Don't get me wrong it's maiden just seems like they have ran out of ideas the good about maiden is there just damn interesting to listento so thats what makes so fun but i expected a bit better and some more originallity on the songs but still a buy for the maiden fans like myself.
2,Wing Commander IV: The Price of Freedom,"The book that is based on the game is really good. But there are some things that are not so good like for example, Blair never fell in love with Sosa in the real game. I really can't see why at all he could fall in love with her. But it is still a good book."
2,Linux Bible 2008,"The book is very informative for Linux starters. Teaches you from where to get the right Linux software that suits your application, software installation and the Linux basics."
2,nice Lee Van Cleef movie,good western not up to the original but good anyway. Lee Van Cleef did a nice job. he always does.
2,Fun way to stress word problems,"This was my daughter's favorite book last year. She begged me to get the third grade one for this coming year as well. She liked the different themes every week (she would try to guess the next theme and enjoyed the anticipation). The problems themselves were solid (made the kids think) but not overly tricky. She solved 95% of them with no guidance at all (I will state math is her strong subject though). Overall, this is a great book to get kids enthusiastic about word problems."
2,The Final Season,Here we have the final 22 episodes of one of my all time favorite TV series. Starting with the double episode about Lee Oswald and ending (I feel prematurely) with the episode Mirror Image. Just what is Scott Bakula doing now? He has returned to Quantum Leap with a new story called A Bold Leap Forward.
2,Kindle e-reader,"I had the chance to see the Kindle before purchasing it and knew that it was the best product out there for what I was looking for. The ease of using the wireless reader is amazing. It is convenient for traveling compared to carrying tons of heavy books around. I thought I would miss that traditional book and turning the actual page but after reading on the Kindle, I have to say I have adjusted very well. Great product and great price."
2,Beautifully harmonic - their best album yet?,This album is getting under my skin. It's a lot like Gaucho - or even better.Every song on the CD is very good and I've made up my mind that my favorite 2 songs are the last 2 songs : ''Negative Girl'' and especially ''West of Hollywood''.West of Hollywood has GOT to be the best song I've heard in a decade or two - maybe since ''Third World Man'' from their Gaucho album. ''Slick tune''.Awesome awesome album - some of the very best music of my lifetime.
2,Wireless is the new way!,"This controller is great, and the fact that it is wireless means that it can work almost anywhere. There are no cords to tangle or get in your way. The guide button also works to turn on the console wirelessly.A good thing about this controller is that it can be used to turn on the Xbox 360. By pressing the guide button, the wireless controller sends a signal that turns on the console. This means that you don't even have to get up to turn on the Xbox 360, making it great for lazy people!(just kidding)The only bad thing about this controller is that it never is really turned off. Even when it is not being used, the ""player one"" light on the ""ring of light"" glows faintly. This greatly reduces the battery life if you do not disconnect the battery pack. It is not all that bad, but it is stupid that the battery pack can become depleted even if you don't use it."
2,friendchips are so COOL,i really liked friendchips because me and my friend could talk to eachother and pass notes without using paper and a pencil plus THE TEACHER DOSENT SEE !!
2,Highly recommend. Enjoyable to read.,This is a great series to read. You can follow the characters thoughout both books. Hopefully Mr. Telep will come out with more in the series. I highly recommend it to everyone.
2,Hidden 80's Gem,"For those of us Rockin', back when ""The Beat Goes On/Switchin' to Glide"" was a nominal hit on alternative Rock stations in the early 1980's, the Kings may be slightly recognizable, but what most people never knew...was that song was only scratching the surface of what this fusion between R&R; and Car's style new-wave techno-pop, was capable of. As an Alterative Rock DJ back in those days, I was privy to these albums and played them on-air any chance I got!This collection presents (I believe) the Kings total output (of two LP's) which will sure to bring a smile to your face and start you air-guitaring despite yourself. Trust me, you'll pat yourself on the back for uncovering an unknown gem of great and diverse tunes, that hold up well even 20 years later."
2,Downriver,"One of the most excitant booksOn the ""Downriver"" you will be accompanied to our protagonists to a world of excitants and dangerous adventures. On this book you will also found a good message specialty for younger readers. Which in summary the author ""Will Hobbs"" tell you how difficult the life is with out parents' advice or adult experience. I truly recommend this book. It is excellent, you'll don't waste your time!"
2,Excellent read,"This book has a dreamy and beautiful quality, in spite of being a murder mystery! I loved every word. In fact, I ordered the rest of the Emma Graham books so I could have the complete series. I love finding a new author who is such a wonderful writer."
2,"oh yeah, I remember that one.....","Getting Hooked is an apt title for this book of ""first lines"" of well-known books written between the 1950's and now. In the category of ""Why didn't someone think of this before,"" it is a very laudable effort at organizing famous books in various categories, and is bound to either rekindle the idea of re-reading your favorites from the past, or prompt you to read for the first time a book you are likely to enjoy because the first lines grab you--the yardstick by which most readers decide to read in the first place! For her effort Ms. Rendell- Smock deserves credit, and readers will surely benefit."
2,Outstanding Job,"Hugh Kerr has done an outstanding job of taking the volumous writings of Martin Luther and bringing them together in a smaller book. Luther's theology is so imortant for the protestant reformation and along with John Calvin and John Wesley, provide us with the three great theologians.Though this book is older now, the areas of thought and quotations are just as good today as they were when the book was originally published.This is an outstanding job and we are indebted to Hugh Kerr for it.J. Robert Ewbank author of ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the 'Isms'"""
2,Deep.,"I just read the e-book who was given to me by a friend here in Michigan.The foreword of Mrs. Doreen Virtue is powerful and the contents of the book put me in a state of deep sleep while awake. Strange, because sometimes I couldn't understand the dialogue, but the transmission was very deep. My dreams were very vivid the night I read it, and there was a state of inner bliss inside me after the reading of the messages."
2,amazing,"I bought this book not to long ago, and I must say, It was one of the best. Luke Davies is an amazing writer. This book just took me, it was so real. I loved it. It makes you think about things in a different way. It was nice reading a book I could relate with in a way. Just amazing."
2,"Candid, aggressive, and modern defense for Socrates' philosophy","The ""Apology"" is an candid, aggressive, and modern defense for Socrates' philosophy, vs. the intolerance of the Athens, that has many similarities in modern persecution on morally corrupt grounds. The Phaedo, a sad effort in comparison, as Socrates defends a rather unimpressive argument for the immortality of the soul, immediately prior to his own demise by hemlock. The reader does an excellent job on both counts."
2,Brilliant !,This is another excellent book by Jacqueline Wilson it's funny and humourous and children and adults alike will thoroughly enjoy it. Wilson really knows how to write a book that children will sit engaged with until they've completed it. Children who don't normally enjioy reading will love this book.
2,spaghetti western music.. MUST HAVE..,"After owning several spaghetti western music cd's ,this turned out to be one of my favorites with classic variations of title song (LONG DAYS OF VENGEANCE). With a total of 31 tracks, all from the movie. Much of cd is on the softer side similar to title song... RECOMENDED"
2,The Best from The Boss,"This is the absolute best Bruce Springsteen album...bar none!If you've never heard it...buy it now...sit back, relax and let it take over, you'll love it!Peace :o)"
2,get parts 1&2 for full impact,"Cuban salsa is a awesome style. you really want to learn this stuff. ignore the short falls of this dvd, because they correct everything by the second dvd, and it all comes together.the first video is kinda shakey on its own. the moves are good, but as other writers have noted, the female teacher leads from the back the whole time.the Rueda calls are not a bad idea. In Rueda the moves are called out like square dancing. so if youre super new, you dont have to think ahead, which can be intimidating at first. having the moves called out ahead is good for new leads, who are just getting the muscle memory.so, try to ignore the female teacher is leading from the back. the male teacher is a good lead - watch his movements. he just seems a little camera shy or whatever. in teh second video, the guy is much stronger. he talks through his own parts and does a great job leading a freestyle at the end."
2,Buy it for your half-dozen favorites,"and let the rest of the 25 grow on you.J'adore absolument Rebecca Malope, l'Orchestre Baobab, et Samira Sa'id. Shukran yaa Charlie, for your part in making this wonderful music available at such a bargain price.All the songs are well-produced (not a given, in my experience),and all the artists technically proficient. So whether the individual listener likes a particular song is gonna be a personal thing."
2,My Bible!,This book turned out better than I had thought - will be my bible on my upcoming construction!
2,Great to listen to,Well I am impressed with this album. Ignore the coment about me hating styx in edge of the century this album has won me over. I finnaly bought this tape for Three bucks in a bookstore. Put me on is a great song about a record yelling at you to put it on and play it loud ultimate rock!! Jennifer is my favorite song. It seems like alot of people don't really care for it but totally check that one out I love the way Dennis opens it with his vocals. And the title track Crysatl Ball is great too. It seems to be the only hit on here and it's a great song. But yes I like this album. Check it out if you aren't that familiar with it yet.
2,WELL MADE DEFENSE KNIFE,"COLT, WE KNOW MAKES GREAT GUNS BUT THEY ALSO SELL TERRIFIC KNIVES FOR THE MONEY AND THIS IS ONE!!! WELL MADE, STURDY AND SHARP!! THANX GOOD SERVICE AND AND PRICE ""BEAR BAUM"
2,HER BEST STUFF EVER!!,"OKAY, SPACER CUOSINS, IT IS TIME FOR THE STATION TOUR OF YOUR LIFE ! MS. CHERRYH'S NEW NOVEL IS PROBLY THE BEST THAT TIS PROLIFIC WRITER HAS EVER WRITTEN. SHE USE THE FAMILAR THEMES OF FAMILY AND HOPLESS OUTSIDERS AS NEVER BEFOR. YOUNG FLETCHER IS TAKEN FORM THE COLD UNCARING WORLD OF PELL STATION AND THROWN INTO A TRIP THAT COULD SEE THE RENEWAL OF UNION -ALLIANCE WAR, AND DRUING LEARNS WHAT IT MEANS TO BE PART OF THE CREW OF A STAR MECHANTER. THIS BOOK IS SHEER JOY FOR ANYONE WHO HAS EVER YERNED TO GO TO THE STARS, GIVE IT TO YOUR FAVAORITE DREAMER SOON!"
2,Best thing since sliced bread!,This thing is wonderful. It cuts potatoes into fries in seconds and with my bad hands it is wonderful!
2,the dreamcast`s best so far!,"Since the launch of the dreamcast last fall the dreamcast has been hurting for a worthy RPG(role playing game),but silver is a breath of fresh air for the genre.The game sports beautiful graphics and real time battles(you don`t have to take turns),but on the down side the camera angle is alittle to far away for my tastes and the A.I.(artificial intelligence)of the fellow adventures in your group can be frustrating during the battles.All in all though i really had a great time playing this game and that`s what it`s all about,isn`t it!"
2,Solid Season,"Wings-Season 7 is one of the better seasons of Wings. Wings is not at the caliber of Seinfeld or Will and Grace as far as wit and timing, but it is still an enjoyable and comforting comedy."
2,As Advertised And Described,What can I say? It works great with my hook and loop set-up on my Porter Cable polisher. Worth the money and it is lasting a long time with normal use. I will buy again.
2,Earth Retention Systems Handbook,A good practical handbook. It is a good reference book for both geotechnical and structural engineers.
2,Excellent set,"A fun set, nicely mastered, with sharp color and excellent sound. And one of the few Trek sets of any type that is affordable."
2,Nice,"I bought this to use a desktop in my garage which is about 50 feet from my router. I loaded the disc, plugged it in and it worked. I do use the Windows LAN connection instead of the Trendnet because it seems more reliable. Overall, this is exactly the product I was looking for and at a great Amazon price."
2,Excellent Book,A book to be read and studied over and over. There is so much truth and help in this book--a wealth of biblical wisdom in handling conflicts.
2,More relevant than ever!,"Fast Food Nation sheds light (as it should do) on several important matters, including: how powerful the Fast Food giants and their associate companies have become, the poor quality of meat and health standards, and how immigrants are being treated and exploited by Americans and other immigrants alike.The film brings to the screen the parallel stories of various people associated with a meat packing plant in Colorado that supplies the patties for a (fictional) fast food chain called Mickey's.Greg Kinnear, Bruce Willis, Kris Kristofferson, Ethan Hawke, Avril Lavigne, Luis Guzman, and the rest of the cast carry out their performances very well.The setting, the plot, and the dialogues are all good and even though it's quite graphic at times it does get the message across loud and clear.In short, Fast Food Nation is a movie definitely worth watching, as it is surely an eye opener. 3.5 Stars"
2,Great for the money,"This Lens adapter works great... it enables you to attach different lenses, attach filters of all kinds, and I choose to leave it on all the time, because it protects the lens mechanism. The reason i gave it four stars is because when the hood is attached, there is a fair amount of vignetting... not just vignetting but you can outright see the hood through the lens at small zoom levels... at all four corners. This is overall a great package, but unless you use your zoom (3-4x will do it) you will have to crop every single photo taken with the hood on."
2,Great Speakerphones,"I wish that the base unit and the other units had the same buttons. They are different and that means you have to learn to use two different phones. The phones work well, best speakerphones I have found. Mostly easy to use and they seem to keep a charge for several days. I use the phones on the voip (internet) phone service and they work just find."
2,not what i thought i ordered,"I placed the order for a NEW book. I got a book that had the inner pull-out 'torn' out but there and ripped. Also the book was not NEW. It was slightly used. Corners of book were bent from use.Other than that, the book does the job for a person new to FF IX"
2,Great price !,"Looked all over and finially found this filter here. Lowest price anywhere. Not exactly like the original filter, but it fit fine. Haven't noticed any different in mileage yet, but only put on about about 200 miles. Like the idea, never have to buy another motorcycle filter for my bike, ever. Recieved it very fast from Amazon Thanks, Jim"
2,Jimmy Slang,"The Trial of Jimmy Slang is a delightful play where the Ain't Children are found guilty of word slaughter and Jimmy Slang must face the Family of Speech and account for his constant abuses. It is a fabulous teaching resource. I lost many things I used in the classroom to a fire a few years ago. I have a copy left, but would love to share this resource with other teachers. Does anyone know where to get it? It is great for grades 5-8. Funny, engaging, and educational for this intermediate level student."
2,A classic!,"This is one of those rare books that makes you feel so much more intelligent after reading it. If you want to know the hidden game that is happening under your noses and inside the players heads, if you want to know about hit-and-runs and hitting the cut-off man and all the other things that don't make the highlight reel, this is the book.The only thing that can make this better would be another edition, reflecting the changes in the game. Most of the players in the book have since retired, but that doesn't change how applicable the book is. It is a timeless piece."
2,Becoming my favorite program,"Clever, funny, mind provoking, well written, wonderful cast.How were we so lucky to actually get something worth watching on network tv!"
2,Completely adequate,"This charger gets the job done. You don't need to pay any more than this for an ipod charger. It works, it has a status LED, it doesn't get warm on the socket-so you can leave it in all the time. the cord is maybe six inches shorter than it should be (that's what she said) and the connector is bulkier than an apple one, so most cases will have to be removed. It charges your ipod in a timely fashion and that's all there is to it. You should buy this."
2,A Great Read!,What an exciting book. The characters come to life on the page. I couldn't put the book down! I love how all of the character's perspectives were given throughout the story. I would highly recommend this book!
2,Happy with All-Clad,"All-Clad kicks butt! A couple weeks ago I sent in my 12"" nonstick fry pan due to a defect in the coating, and yesterday I got a 10"" nonstick replacement, but no explanation why they sent a 10"". I called today and they told me the 12"" is on backorder, but they'd be happy to send me out a not nonstick 12"" and to go ahead and keep the 10"" too. Free all-clad? Yes, please! Love that lifetime warranty.Lesson is: the nonstick coating deteriorates over time, but if you take proper care of your pans, All-Clad will replace it. Buy it for the warranty; you'll save money in the long-run."
2,To Change the World,"An amazing and inspiring story of a small, driven R&D engineering company that struggles to convert theory into working hardware, make the bridge from doing ""research"" to ""building products"", that eventually pulls itself out of operating on the brink of bankruptcy, while offering the world a clean, renewable source of energy, the Solar Heated Free Piston Stirling Engine. Shelton does a great job in conveying the personalities, the financial and technical challenges overcome, and the dramatic events that allowed Sunpower to survive through some very trying times."
2,"Handy, but a lot of bits","I use my travel charger quite often. It is great to not have to carry around the full cradle just to charge the battery in my Palm Vx while I'm away from home and office. The extra sync cable is rarely useful for me, as I feel awkward syncing to someone else's machine but it has been handy for installing a needed program update or grabbing a new game while on the road.The only quibble I have is that the kit has a lot of bits to keep track of. A more elegant design would have one cable that connects to the Palm device with the other end capable of plugging into the charger or a sync connector, depending on your needs. That would perhaps enable the charger to have all the various international adapters in one unit instead of loose. Still, it is a valuable accessory and has been worth the cost for me."
2,best self help book I own,"I resonated with this book more that any other. It is exactly what the title says, a no nonsense concise description of what makes up a mature healthy adult psyche. I found it easy to dismiss other less precise, more preachy/cheesy self help books. But when I read this book it just resonated as ""truth"" and those less functional parts of my psyche had to admit that they had been found out. It's similar to the feeling one gets when reading the Feynman Lecture Series about physics -- they are both masterful distillations."
2,Catwings Soar,"The Catwings books are little treasures. Ursula LeGuin's skilled, poignant, humorous writings and her sensitive insights on genuine, deep emotions combine to entertain, create suspense, and tug at the reader's heartstrings all at the same time. S.D. Schindler's beautiful pen-and-ink illustrations capture the delightful personalities of the cats without becoming cartoons. He makes us believe that cats with wings are entirely possible and real. This amazing illustrator should have received more recognition over the years, for he is a master.The Catwings books are not only for children. Adults who love cats and who can believe that all things are possible will revere these wonderful stories, as well."
2,Great but some stuff was really stupid,I thought this book was great but the killer was so stupid and had nothing realy to do with the story. The book was great but it had this weak finish that really makes you disipointed. I think Stine could do so much better.
2,Love the Gipsy Kings,"When I got ""The Best of the Gipsy Kings"" cd I only bought it for track 18, but after I listen to the who cd, I relized that I had been missing alot. This is great cd that holds the listeners attention. This cd is really great when you are working out. ""The Best of the Gipsy Kings"" is great cd that introduce me to one of my favorite bands."
2,Rampling fan.,"I am a huge Charlotte Rampling fan so i liked this movie because of her. It's very slow paced. There are some sex scenes and nudity but nothing special. What i loved was watching Rampling and her reactions toward this annoying bubbly young girl who kept interrupting her writings during the day and disturbing her beauty sleep by bumpin'-n-grindin' every night with a diferent guy , old man, young boy, middle aged man, older man and basicaly any male who came to her door.This movie is a little sexy with a bit of mystery, some sex and nudity, taking place in beautiful surroundings and not violent or gross at all. It's a very pleasant movie to watch and what it does in the end is make you think...... about youth, aging, life, who you are, etc.Rampling's great so i bought it, but if she wasn't in it i probably wouldnt've even given it a second thought.Thank you for reading."
2,Even better than the movie!,"I initally read this one just because of the movie, wich I watched just for Tom Waits. I can't say enough, so I'll just say, Read It."
2,great product,"wonderful for crafting, sewing, or just working at your desk. hubby & I both have one in our home office's"
2,Sharp,"I'm currently in the middle of this book and enjoying it thoroughly. The dialogue is dead on and some of the situations are very funny. What I'm getting from this story is that we all should be so lucky to get second chances to make past wrongs right no matter how much we have to ""suck it up"" to do it. Henry, ""The Assassin"", is a marvelous character once some of the layers are peeled away and Sophie is the friend everyone should have when traveling on the road to redemption even though some of her behavior is pretty disturbing at times. I'm looking forward to finding out what her secrets are. Overall, this is a very funny and very poignant book... a real page turner from me. Also, the acknowledgements in the back are just as hysterical as parts of the story. The author has a wicked sense of humor."
2,"Watson is the ""Voice""","The title of this recording is aptly fits this CD, for Watson has the voice, style, and excitement, as reflected on the great tracks of this recording.Watson is unbelievable with the consumate ease that he flows from pop to the demanding repertoire chosen for him. His technique and vocals are exceptional in performing the music.5 Stars!"
2,The ValueReporting Revolution,"The ValueReporting Revolution brings together an astounding amount of real, relevant (and highly controversial) information on how the capital markets currently function, a terrific framework for understanding what is needed to enable greater transparency and therefore efficiency, and compelling arguments for change.Remarkably entertaining given the seriousness and ground-breaking nature of its central thesis.An important read for corporates hoping to understand how to achieve better public market valuations, and for buy and sell side analysts concerned about current industry trends."
2,The one flaw,"This was a beautifully written book, as most other reviewers have noted, but at times it became too obvious. At various moments throughout the narrative, questions are answered in an abrupt fashion. It felt like every time I was beginning to figure out what was going on, a figure appears who answers all my questions and then some. It became disconcerting at times, though the characters and prose kept me going.It was a delightful read and worth the money and time, but it had a potential that few contemporary books do, and it fell short."
2,My nephew loves it,"I bought this truck for my great nephew for Christmas and my niece tells me that he just loves this truck. It is high so he can push it easily and it moves fast. Apparently, the neighbor boy puts my great nephew into the truck and pushes him around. My niece thinks it might go a bit too fast for that activity. I have always loved Tonka toys for their durabity and quality. I would definitely buy this toy again."
2,Great Buy!,"I bought this DVD to complete my set as I already own the other two. Packaging was as advertised, and delivery was on time. If you are a fan of the transformers franchise this is a must own!"
2,A Beautiful Film,Fulfilling and erotic yet a feeling of undesirable controlled tension. A must for the drama love story geeks.
2,Now sleeps the crimson petal...,"Why bother about historical accuracy at all? The scene where Becky sings ""Now sleeps the crimson petal"" is probably the most memorable and moving scene of the whole film. I loved it."
2,Great! Amazing!,"I love the last few chapters and the only reason I gave it only four stars is beacause the beging is sorta outta character but, the rest is great! It is gory just so you know. But at least it is not on screen."
2,Stupidville,"I was introduced to this cd by a very close friend who knows all about LA hiphop and I'm so glad that he made me listen to it. This cd is the one I listen to when I'm in a good mood and need a good laugh to go along with it. The first track prepares you for the rest of the cd and not one song is a let down. Try it, you'll like it."
2,Love the movie! Just not used.,"I practically grew up with this movie with my sisters. It brings back a lot of fun memories for me and in watching it again now, and having had some education in animation, I think it has a very unique look compared to a lot of Disney's traditionally animated features back in the day. The only problem with the copy that I got was that I had ordered a used one to include the DVD as well as Blue Ray. All of the disks were included, but the cover was only for the blue ray and the DVD copy came in a paper sleeve inside it. If it doesn't have it's own place in the case itself, I'm not sure how well I'll be able to keep track of it before it gets lost or even broken. Once again. The movie is a since childhood keeper for me, I just prefer the cover to also be what it's advertised to be."
2,one of the best albums of the decade,I didn't think this CD was all that when I bought it but now I listen to it and it's truly an r&b classic of the 2000's and much better than the other music out there today though she's following the footsteps of many musical legends that came before her and inspired her. She writes beautiful piano hooks and sings beautiful melodies with her gorgeous voice and that's what makes all those grammys mean something.
2,Unique Cheese slicer.,"This is the second Zyliss Dial-n-Slice Cheese slicer I have purchased. No, the first one didn't break. Because we liked the first one we bought so much, we wanted a second one for a second home in Florida. It slices well and is safe to use because of the adjustable mechanism. Would make a very nice hostess gift with some cheeses to accompany itZyliss Dial-n-Slice Cheese Slicer.Ruth"
2,High Quality components,"The components are high quality and I'm very happy overall with this setup. I will complain that the mounting plate on the pole was welded on upside down, which made it much more difficult to install. Unfortunately, I didn't think to check that out until the base was already set in concrete, so there wasn't a whole lot I could do about it as you can't just pull out 4'x2' of concrete and send the whole thing back. Thanks to a couple of strong backs, we were able to get it set up still however and have been having a party ever since. Would highly recommend this system, but as soon as you get it, check to plates on both the base (that goes into the concrete) and the opposing mounting plate (the base of the pole) and make sure they are the right direction to start with."
2,My Opinion,"I agree with ""It has got everything"" and ""THIS IS A KEEPER"". Not much more you can add. It's a rereader. I love the ending. I have all Lindsey's books and this one of my favorites. The only way to tell if it will one of yours is to read it."
2,"Great, practical advice!",Entertaining and easy to read with priceless information. This book is a must read for people in organizations of any size.
2,Better than everything except Folsom and San Quentin,"A good, professional, performance by Johnny at the absolute peak of his career. Everything is exceptionally well done and the show rolls along like the freight train Johnny was at this time. The packaging is well done as well with good sound, liner notes and period photos. The only down side is (if you want to call it that) is that this ""professional"" performance does not compare to the live wire energy of either of his prison concerts. So start there first."
2,My sentiments eggsactly !,"This great Chet Baker CD is now out of print ! What gives ? I thought Jeff Bezos was a big Chet Baker fan.... This CD is great and it makes you dream of being in Paris taking a sentimental walk with Chet and a few girls from Rue Clichy. I can still dream, can't I ?"
2,Mom loved them...,"Wanted washable slippers for my Mom, these wash nice and are very comfortable for her. Color is nice too... sort of periwinkle."
2,A Fun Toy,"This toy is fun, and it was all I wanted it to be for my kiddos. Kids do need supervising and rules, however, because they did get to rocking pretty high - the teeter totter says right on it that children should be cautioned against rocking too high and I could see why, especially if there are mixed ages riding on it - the older one(s) can handle more than the younger one(s). Assembly was VERY easy - no tools, it snapped together very easily. I feared that the handles would come loose, but they haven't. It seems very sturdy and the kids love it."
2,A must.,"I would also concur that this is a must for any serious beginner, intermediate or intermediate advanced jazz-keyboard player who wants to learn jazz baselines.It teaches base lines for all kinds of major and minor scales, diminished scales, different time signatures, waltz, bossa-nova etc"
2,"if you're going to Africa, read this first","My sister and I read this book in preparation for a four month trip to africa, of which two months was spent on bikes. This book was the single most useful, common-sense guide we read in all of our preparation - both for biking, and just generally getting by in Africa. Really - read this!"
2,My Buddy,This is part of my grooming kit. It definitely keeps your beard at a level length. This is a good trimmer to have.
2,INCREDIBLE PRODUCT- INCREDIBLE PRICE,"I bought these slippers for myself about a month and a half ago, I'm a woman and bought the small. I got them within 2 or 3 days. When I openend the box I was soooo unbelievably happy with my purchase. I coud not get over the quality of the slipper for the price I paid! I pay almost the same price at Walmart for so-so slippers. And these Bronco slippers are made by Reebok to boot!! You can not go wrong with these slippers......They are soooo comfortable, the soles are very thick for a slipper. I walk outside with them all the time and they are barely worn down and I am very hard on my slippers! The slippers are kind of formed so when you put your foot in them the slippers kind of cradle your feet. I was sorry I did not order more the first time so I am back to buy a few more pairs....You wont be sorry with these slippers! Go Broncos!!"
2,A nice place to start,"This book is great for beginners, who are unfamiliar with some of the different types of lace. Although no lace is gone into in depth, there is enough in each part to get you started and understand the differences. The illustrations are very clear, and I found the instructions quite easy to follow. It is only a little book, though, so don't expect too much. The one thing that really delighted me was the chapter on netting - how the fishermen used to do it. There Have been many times when I've searched for information on this topic and have come up empty."
2,Unbeatable for the price,"I have had my Backline 600 for a about 4 years now and everything about it is superb, especially considering the price.After some research, I found that unlike the other Backline series amplifiers the had a true professional GK Preamp. More specifically it is either the same or modeled after the famous 800rb that became a standard for big acts in the 80's and continues to be one of the most popular stage amps.300 Watts is more than enough to power most rigs. Most 1x15 and 4x10 cabs are rated around 200 watts and full rigs like a 2x10 paired with a 1x15 blare at 4ohm."
2,exercise,I bought this for Jessica because I really like her workouts. I have other DVD's of hers and just order another one and can't wait to get.
2,Love it!,Album is filled with so much good music! I love her old and this music! She's blossoming and I love it!
2,Darby is a classic!,one of the best one of a kind. Sean Connory is the best actor.I say that it is one of the best Irish musicals EVER made!!
