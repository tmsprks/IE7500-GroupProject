1,It trashed my Smart Media Card,"I purchased this player last month (but not from ...(this website)) and it works just fine, I am giving it a one star because it formats the smartmedia cards so they are no longer usable in other smartmedia devices, such as camera, card readers, etc. Some MP3 player mfg have developed a utility to format the cards back to the original state but D-Link has not done this for their players and have no intention of doing so. I just want to let you know this before you trash a SmartMedia card like I did."
1,NOT AS CUTE AS THE COMMERCIAL,"We saw the commercial for this toy and immediatly wanted to get it for our son who is 6 months. After unwrapping it, which took quite a while due to the packaging we were somewhat disappointed. In order to get Pooh to dance etc. the baby's rattle needs to be very close to the toy. The baby also needs to ""really"" shake his rattle quite vigorously to get Pooh to work. The toy itself is cute but smaller than imaged in the commercial. One other drawback..... to get the toy to start his tummy has to be pushed. We find that we need to do that for our son. The dancing and music captures my son's attention. Unfortunatly, Pooh's voice is very distorted and hard even for adults to understand. This was a very good idea for a toy but could use some improvements."
1,Only One Good Song On It,"I purchased this item because of the song ""Believe."" It turns out that it is the only memorable song on the CD, and the only one worth listening to. I should have waited until there was a downloadable MP3 version of it."
1,Did it really end like I think it did?,I learned some things but man it was slow and disjointed. The audio book was especially cast wrong by the way they made Kennedy's voice.
1,these are FAKE 7 for all mankind jeans! dont be fooled!,"these are NOT 7 for all mankind jeans if that's what you are looking for - those jeans go for $125-200 a piece. the people who make these came up with their ""similar"" name to trick you into buying them - they probably figure its a numbers game and ""some"" will just keep them.. dont be fooled - if youre looking for real 7's - go to eluxury.com and you'll find them there."
1,NO!!!!!You are stupid!!!!!!,"This doll is bad for little girls,and you think that having a belly ring and a tattoo is cool,so this is your problem.I hate Bratz and I hate everything else with them.This doll can teatch small children how to make bad things on thier body.In my dreams:I will never get a tatoo or a stupid belly ring.(...)"
1,Overpriced and flimsy,"I looked around alot for a good small tabletop propane grill, and thi swas the only one I could find. I do not like it at all, it is very small, and has no cover that moves, you have to pull it off and set it down, it does not fold up. It also takes forever to cook a steak, and the low setting is useless. Very small surface and heavy and clunky too, the $19.00 i got at Wal mart was much better. Save your $$."
1,I did not like the book.,"I think promises in the wind was boring becuase it did not have a lot of details.When we got to the end of the book they should of said what happened to Josh and Janie. Also because they didn't say what happened to Lonnie. But other than that, the book was okay."
1,You call this music,What total crap. I cant believe anyone listens to this and its a shame that my one star review wont drag down that rating at all and do all you potential buyers a favor and scare you off.
1,I should have listened to that guy!,"I bought this product from another web-site, and I'm generally unimpressed. If it doesn't resolve itself in the next few days, I might return the unit.I like the heafty feel and satisfying clicks it makes while in use. However, it frequently (10-15% of the time) misfires and shoots 2 rounds subsequently. My unit already sticks after casual, indoor use, and the ""out-of-ammo"" stop won't halt the slider. If you don't watch, you have no idea you're out. = \"
1,This was a pirated video that we received!!!,We opened the package to find a pirated video. It was a Sony DVD with Sharpie Marker writing. I am very upset being that this was a gift!! How embarrassing.
1,10x10 popup,the 10x10 popup arrived with one damaged leg and a broken zipper I have put in for a return but have not received a response yet and its been a week. if the zipper was not so week I think it would be fine at this point I just would like to get my money back
1,Absolutely painful to read is this book!,"Either this stuck up English twit Sykes is writing all about himself or he's writing stupid, phony stone age stories. If I want dumb stone age fiction I'll watch The Flintstones."
1,Gardman bird bath,"This bird bath is very light weight. It's attractive, but not fit for the Colorado wind. Also, the birds did not come to it."
1,Didn't play has been sent back,"The DVD wouldn't play even after updating my player only one of the four DVD,s worked. The DVD has been returned."
1,Lasted 6 months,"It tears quite easily, the material tends to brittle with time, it sticks to the table when it rains, and overall it ruined our table more than protecting it. Highly not recommended."
1,Very low quality.,"i must have gotten a totally different collar than the other reviews because this is a very low quality collar, its missing some studs, and the leather is very dried out and cracking. I'm nervous to even put it on my medium pit bull because one small pull, and this collar will go to pieces."
1,Accountant,"I have been using Intuit Products for many years in our accounting practice. Each time we have upgraded to the latest Quickbooks ( Pro Versions )we notice that the program is sluggish, slow to load and function. The Pro 2007 version is extremely slow and we have PC hardware that is fairly new (XP pro). As an accountant, I do not need all the ""window dressing"" interface menu screens that I believe slow down this very capable program. Too bad Intuit does not offer an accountant's version that has a cut and dry interface ( pull down menus as previous versions, eg 2002) and is speedy to operate."
1,i got what i paid for,"well they were prep pads and they did seem to have alcohol on them, but they were very small and after wiping the top of the vial there did not seem to be enough pad or alcohol left to clean the injection area .. were cheap to buy and expensive to use, since I usually end up using two pads / injection..will buy better pads next time i order......."
1,Disapointing,"I really tried to get into this book, but gave up after about 200 pages of jumping around from one underdeveloped character to another. The problem is that there are many potentially excellent characters, whom I would have loved to read more about. By the time one character sparked my interest though, the book jumped to another location, with a new character to become aquainted with.I like the concept of the series and would like to see read more stories like this, but instead of having to keep up with so many characters in one novel, why not just spread them out into seperate novels alltogether?..."
1,Watch OUT!,"I bought a similar Troy-Bilt weedeater model number TR525ES. I put gas in it, and fired it up. It seemed to work fine when cranking --then I tried using it. The bottom casing that held the twine was put in place with two clasps that would come off easliy if you simply pinched it with your fingers. If you lightly touch the casing to the ground, the whole thing flies apart!!!! There are four small metal cylinders inside the spool that are supposed to hold and guide the twine. When it blew apart those little cylinders flew across the yard, NEVER TO BE FOUND AGAIN! I have NEVER seen a product basically destroy itself like this. I was shocked!!When I contacted Troy-Bilt about the problem, they said that the part wasnt covered by the warranty and that I would have to PAY FOR THEM!! I WILL NEVER EVER EVER buy a Troy-Bilt product again!! I cant believe that they would want me to pay for their faulty design! What a piece of CR@P!Do yourself a favor and buy a different product!!"
1,Offensive and empty.,"This is definitely problematic for children. A CHRISTMAS CAROL is wonderful...why make a Jewish tale out of it, and then lace it with such ""Jewish-y"" stereotypes? Almost every Yiddish word -- and of course they'll all have to be defined for young readers - is an insult or an epithet. What does this bring to Hanukkah or to Children's literature? Nothing -- Bupkis."
1,Not for big babies.,We bought one thinking it'd be great to have for our 9 week old baby. He's approximately 15lbs and we could barely squeeze him into the carrier. They may rate it up to 25lbs but there's no frickin' way that's happening in this life time. Buy it for less than 10lb kiddos and you might be OK.
1,NIN needs to change which clearly hasn't happened here,"I've followed Trent Reznor and his crew for quite a while, and I've loved his music. With the comming of this album everybody said his music was going to change, to such an extent that his band was to disclame him and name the album Trent Reznor opposed to Nine Inch Nails. This rather excited me and I was quite dissapointed when I heard this music. It was exactly the same as the Downward Spiral. Trent needs to change and gets some new ideas in."
1,lineman,"very sorry wrestlemaina out of all the 22 this one ranks 21st, second to last, not only does Bret get Screwed Beefcake gets screwed also, hart shouldve retianed the title, Hogan and Beefcake with the tag belts wouldve been awesome, horrible undercard only hbk delivered as he carried Tatanka to a good match, this one is very poor, only better than the hideous wm 2000."
1,Constant noise,"This product works ok, not great. Heavy interference with my cell phone or other items, even worse when my cell is unplugged and only the cell phone charger is plugged in. Uses regular batteries which is nice, no need to worry about recharging (but you need to keep spare batteries on hand). Works great in my kitchen, but not in my bedroom."
1,okay.,handy tool but having a great dictionary on the kindle already... there is no point on the kindle store.
1,I figured out why my poison oak wasn't getting any better...,"... was because this product doesn't work. Five days after applying it and it's only gotten worse, I was delighted to see the word ""homeopathic"" written on the bottle. It's like someone calling me and saying, ""you fell for that! haha you fool!"" I want to get healthy, not feed the trend of alternative medicine. There should be a warning label on garbage like this saying, ""This product can never be proven to work, and that's why we have to put the word 'homeopathic' on it.""It's also extremely disturbing how zealous the proponents of this product are. Did I say 'trend of alternative medicine'? Maybe 'cult' is a better word."
1,Just okay,I've had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear. It appears to wobble around the ear and leaves me with the feeling that it is going to fall off at any time. There are many better headsets out there that fit more comfortably and do not leave you wondering what is going to happen.
1,Not compatible with modern systems,Why continue selling a product that isn't compatible with Windows XP Professional? None of the movies would play with the most recent version of Quicktime and the application crashes frequently. Not recommended.
1,Unbelievably poor service.,"I ordered the long bed version of this jointer in Jan. After 2 delays already, Amazon is now quoting a June delivery. Jet says these items are available and have never been on backorder. Amazon says they can't get them, no other explanation. Amazon, you have lost a few customers on this one."
1,Rubbish,This book is nothing but rubbish. A light and irresponsible analysis of the zapatista rebellion made by a government-linked author....
1,"""PR Guy"" review","I thought your review was hilarious.Point 1) you mention the main actress as a portrait of a beauty (""steaming beauty,"" ""bod to die for,"" ""beautiful physical specimen,"" ""no silicone"", etc.).Next, in point 2) you mention that men are jerks who see women as sexual objects.Ah, the irony."
1,Omg Seriously?!,"The concept of this movie may have been good, but the musical score drove me to turn it off! This is what happens when an artistic attitude takes over. The music was completely off with timing and had no relevance at all! It was really annoying, so much so that I couldn't finish it.Self ConvictionsSelf Consciousness"
1,Wow this is bad...,"Im sure this went straight to DVD but even that is giving it too much credit. How Redbox got this in thier machines is frankly baffling. It's so horribly produced, the animation looks like it was made on an early 90's pc. The dialog is so bad, long stretches of nothing said, public domain music and effects....list goes on. Don't waste your time or money. Wow...."
1,Nice Start....Predictable Ending,"""A Piece of Me for a Piece of You"".... Now there's a line for you. The story of Ant and Sharron is as old as time - Boy yells out the car window to a woman who is, in essence, 'too good for him'; Girl falls for ruff-neck boy anyway; boy continues to be a playa, playa ('cause that's what they do); boy gets in trouble; Girl's man-hating friend dogs out the boy; sistah stands by her man - they live happily ever after. Nothing too out of the ordinary in this book. Tone's and Celena's characters helped to add some excitement to the monotony - but in the end - the story is too predictable and there just wasn't enough to keep me intrigued. I would really rate this about 1 and a half stars - but that wasn't one of my options, so I rounded up to two!"
1,Cliche,"I would not recommend this book...OK...Maybe you will call me picky but I am looking for the original...the gutsy portrat of human feelings and souls...true conflicts and passions when I pick a book....well written and intense captivating stories...the same old, same old doesn't do it for me anymore...so If I don't find that ""it"" factor that screams these characters have skin and blood and their guts are clearly portrayed through pages filed with a narative that flows ...I just won't say I liked what I read...There is a lot to the romance style and it will never be what it can be if we always settle for the same old cliche....SO far, the only writter that has fully accomplished that... in my opinion... is Diana Gabaldon...that my friends is a good writter...but I'll kep on searching...keep on siping from all authors and books that fall on my lap...I want to find more amazing romance writters and novels....I a sure I will....but Kiss and Tell was not one of those...sorry"
1,Bad video quality,"The copy of the video seems bootleg. It does not cover the entire screen and is very pixelated. Fantastic Spanish film, but the quality of the DVD is very low."
1,"Decent, but didn't live up to expectations","I loved the first Getaway and was very skeptical of all the bad reviews I'd been seeing. Unfortunately, many of them are correct. I just got Black Monday a few days ago and its already quickly losing much of my interest. While the first Getaway was gritty and griping, the sequel is comparably bland. The story in the first was simple and made sense without getting too complicated, but in Black Monday I often don't know or don't care why the characters are being asked to do certain missions (much of this has to do with the fact that the interlude movies are annoyingly long). There are a few upgrades - you can ride a motorcycle, etc - but these really seem like minor issues. The game is also too easy. Its too bad - I was looking forward to Black Monday. My advice: if you really want to play it wait a few wait a few months until you can buy a cheap used version. At least you won't feel too let down this way."
1,Not as advertized. Cheap Chinese crap,This must be measured in the metric system. Did not fit a standard US GFI receptacle. Had to break the plastic alignment plug to get it to work.
1,It's a dud,"Entertainment Weekly was right on with their grade of ""D+"" for this CD. I bought it because I liked the previous Darkness release, but this one veers strongly into silly hard rock that is at best annoying and at worst completely lacking in any entertainment value whatsoever. There were moments on this CD where I heard traces of Boston, the ""lite metal"" of Scorpions or Def Lep, and most of all a whole lot of Queen. Unfortunately they've captured only the SOUND of those bands without any of the sparkle or melodic skill that made them special. I'm pretty amazed that there are people giving this album 5 STARS. (!!!????) It just goes to show, there's no accounting for taste (or a complete absence of it)."
1,brat's last stand,instead of new tracks brat wanna remix her mid 90's single plus add a few more alternative mixes with it come on jd's that busy anyway i hope this is brat's last cd her time is up.
1,"disapointment, save your money.","I rented this because of the great reviews, boy I wish I had not wasted my money on this unscary, long, dull, predictable movie. Some reveiwers said this was one of the scariest movies they had seen?????Give me a break! There are some nursery rhymes that are more frightening than this. Margot Kidder is just annoying and I was so glad when she was killed."
1,DISAPPOINTED,I had lost some of my pictures from my recent trip to Europe. The pictures are irreplacable and I hoped that I could recover them from my disks. I was unable to recover even one of these precious pictures.
1,Quickcam for Notebooks,"This webcam does not work with notebooks. I have a brand new Dell Inspirion 1705 and it does not work consistently. I thought maybe it was because of Vista, but it says that it is Vista compatible. I was able to get it working 1 time, and it had a very clear picture, but I have not been able to get it to work since. I have notified Logitech, but have yet to receive a response after 2 weeks."
1,verbose and meandering,The book is verbose and meandering. With a great deal of pruning it might actually have something to say but reading it is not much fun.
1,Not enough for a book,"While I commend the authors for making a cute cartoon comment on Buddhism and those we humans might think ""beneath us"" (sheep), this is not enough material for a book. It was a serious overexpenditure -- and in *hardback*, no less???This would have made a cute Web site, no more. It takes literally five minutes to read."
1,What everyone has said is true...,"Sad but true, this figure is a disappointment. She has a limited degree of articulation. The arms are sad. They only move at the shoulders. Head moves, knees bend, legs move at hips (with a large range of motion there). Movable at waist/torso as well. Costume is painted on for upper body (purple arms and chest). Why oh why have they let us down? This is more like a freakish hybid cross of a megacephalic (oversized head) Barbie and a real action figure...something went severly wrong in the design and production process. Well, you have been warned."
1,Interesting and funny but flawed...,"This is a funny and interesting book, but I had some very strong differences of opinion with the author. What kind of person likes bands like Poison and Cinderella but thinks bands like Judas Priest/Iron Maiden/Slayer and old Metallica are not worth listening to? Very strange. I guess maybe North Dakota is as warped as I've heard. Anyway, this is a good little book for nostalgia purposes if nothing else. The ""growing up"" stories are pretty funny, and the author's take on all those Gun's & Roses videos featuring dolphins is dead on. This guy was right to be frightened of the crowd at a Slayer concert: they'd eat him alive."
1,Why does it take so long to ship?!,I have always had good luck ordering through Amazon. I cant believe this vendor has not shipped my item when I ordered it 3 days ago and it is stock!Rich Danhauer
1,Sour Cream,"32 years ago I was so stoked that Clapton was finally coming out with a new album, I walked five miles to Deorsey's Records in Lewiston, Maine the day that it was released to buy this much anticipated record. The still near virgin vinyl remains in my LP collection and has only been played once. Once was enough. Heroin robbed a true master of his creativeness, inspiration and technical ability. Sad."
1,Video Purchase,I have never received this product as of 9/13/2010. I wrote to the seller twice and never received a response. I have filed a complaint with Amazon. I would not order from this seller.
1,Didn't like it.,I just could not get into this book. To me it was one of those where it didn't take long for me to realize that I just didn't want to read much further. I admit that maybe I should have given it a better chance and many times I'll do just that in spite of the fact that a book starts off boring but I simply had no inclination to read much more then 30 or so pages.
1,Bad Experience,"I have only one complaint about this product and if I had hearing in only one ear, I would have no complaints. The left speaker gives me nothing but static -- much like my former wife. Unlike her, I can at least turn these off. I'm shopping for a new pair, and they will not be AR."
1,ONLY WORKS FOR 1 YEAR!!!!,"This product is only good for 1 year. I don't remember seeing that discussed when I purchased it. I bought the Protection Portfolio, and now it is no good. In order to get the product online, I have to repurchase it. So, basically I spent good money for nothing. How would Suze Orman feel about that in my budget? Two thumbs down!"
1,Stupid story....,i don't see what's so great about this book. i;m halfway through it and it is boring for the most part. i could care less about the charecters and nothings happening. all they do is sit around and talk. Don't waste your money on this book.
1,Useless (or at least near-useless),"This clunky mini chopper seems pretty useless to me. If someone finds something that chops well using this device I'd be interested to know what it is. Everything in mine either a) jams the device up or b) ""bruises"" whatever I'm chopping so bad the result is completely unappetizing.I thought this might work well for, say, cilantro or basil and the like, but the result isn't pretty...you basically get dark-green mushy stuff when you're finished.Did I mention it's *impossible* to clean? Things get trapped *behind* the blades and go up into the handle. Good luck really flushing this thing out.OK--well, I have to admit this chopper is decent for peanuts--those don't get caught in the mechanism. For a small amount of nuts to be chopped to go on ice cream or something this makes a decent tool. So perhaps that's one use.Not a big expense here, and maybe the bigger chopper jams less--I don't know. Don't waste your money on this device though."
1,dont wast your money,its juat a ripoff you call your selves misfits fan misfits died when glen danzing left ive listened to them science iwas 1 year old dont buy this go static age
1,"Extraordinary performance of No. 5, Atrocious sound. Violins wrong side.","I have never heard such a good preformance of ANY string quartet or quintet. Rating each movement from 1 poor to 5 I have never before rated such a recording 5 5 5 5.The treble on all these recordings is so distorted to be almost unlistonable. Also the louds are usually far too load sounding nothing as they do in in a live performance. The parts of the other performances I could stand hearing to the end had much poorer performances, perhaps Mozart's fault since many of the themes are trivial and repeat endlessly. Over half the quartet recordings in my large collection have the violins on the wrong side. This does not bother me now since,having biwireable speakers, I have the B speakers reversed. Absent such speakers banana plugs can be quickly changed but that is a big bother. Otherwise, listen with headphones."
1,Does not perform as claimed,"These batteries do not perform as advertised. Although they fit the equipment in place of genuine Panasonic batteries, they simply don't hold at charge. I purchsed three of these batteries for our cordless phones. After just a few months the charge started to decline to where our phones now work less than 15 minutes between charges. Fortunately we have three phones so we make do, but, they hold so little charge now that the phone signal ""low battery"" as soon as we answer a call. This is a very bad product. Don't waste your money, even at $.95... We are now switching back to the Panasonic product."
1,Over the top,"The book IS frightening as some reviewers have stated. Many of the acts described in it are feasible but it's hard to imagine a 20 year plan being put into place so effortlessly. All of the terrorist plans work to perfection. There are no moles, no one ever has a change of heart, all of these explosives and weapons are brought into the country, anthrax is created and through all this no one talks to the govt. The reality is that many terrorist plots have been foiled over the last 10 years when someone came forward to report suspicious behavior. The book is exciting enough, but it is marred by the author's constant preaching of his far right wing views. (And no, I am not a liberal) Just OK, wouldn't recommend it."
1,Simplistic and one-dimensional,"Eldridge's attempt to revitalize Christian masculinity is well intentioned, and I cannot deny the obvious passion with which he writes. In many men Eldridge rekindles the fire for God that has been smothered in our current culture.However, his concept of ""wild"" masculinity fails to go beyond the Braveheart, sword-wielding, strap-a-machine-gun-to-my-Hummer-and-take-off-for-a-weekend-into-the-mountains-hunting-cougars view of masculinity.His point is this: Live passionately. What he says, however, does not encourage spiritual growth among men as much as it tries to bring us back to our caveman roots. For a more balanced look at Masculine Spirituality, try Arnold's ""Wildmen, Warriors, and Kings."""
1,soft ware that does not work,I bought this item because the price was good. I wasted my money as the soft ware included didn't work. It was out of date and we were unable to update it. We have never used this product
1,Disappointing!,"I love my AeroGarden and was thrilled with the herbs and even happier with the cherry tomatoes. When I discovered the green bean kit, I couldn't wait to try it. My five-year old son loves green beans, and I was looking forward to having fresh beans to give to him. When I planted the green beans, they grew rapidly just like the other kits. However, the plants just grew and grew. They became overly bushy and never produced any beans. I waited and waited for the beans to grow and then finally tossed the plants out and replanted tomatoes. This kit was very disappointing, and I am hesitant to try it again."
1,Pure Garbage,"i bought the edited version for my son, they curse so much through the cd that the songs are butchered,definetly a waste of money, MUST RAPPERS CURSE EVERY TWO SECONDS dont they realise they would sell more albums if they didnt,since more people would would be able to purchase it(younger crowd) i felt like snapping this cd in two bits. we need more people like will smith,usher and mase"
1,Bummed,"Warning! This item does not come with rotating leveling base as shown in the photos. As pictured it would have been perfect for my project...as is, it is useless. Back it goes!"
1,A waste of time and money,"I should have paid more attention to the negative reviews. I bought these to season my humidor. After seven days the relative humidity had gone from 40% to 44%. I know the instructions say to wait 14 days but a 4% increase in 7 days is pretty slow. I don't think it would ever get to 84%. I bought some distilled water and seasoned it the old fashioned way by wiping it down, leaving the sponge in the box for a day and wetting the humidifier with a 50/50 mix of polypropylene glycol and water. The RH went to 52% before I even closed the box. Next day remove the sponge, wipe it down again with distilled water, wait another day and your ready to add the cigars."
1,The Janson Directive,"The suspense of this novel is overpowered by the minutia. Escrutiatingly detailed descriptions of every gadget our hero uses makes one forget Janson has a directive and I, quite truthfully, found myself not cheering for him to win, but simply to get to the end of a painful book. We know Robert Ludlum knows his stuff, but in this instance, he sounds more like an encyclopedia than a novelist."
1,i dislike this game,"ok, i played rise of the kasai(sequal) before i played this game so thats why im tired with it. Theres only so much fun u can have with this game. In rise of kasai at first i was like this game is great, this is cool. The characters are cool but I got bored. Why did I get bored? Its a simple clunky hack n' slash game with an ability to stealth around but why? This is supposed to be one of the best underrated games?? pleeeaaaase"
1,somewhat boring,Watched the DvD and found it repetitive and somewhat boring. There was a few good tips. Would rather have this in a book format.This might be good for the new quilter just learning how to put colors together.
1,Skunk off,Shampooed the dog and she still smells like skunk. The internet remedy worked much better.Using the shampoo got rid of the oily substance but not the smell.
1,Not for Mac users,"I'm sure this is a wonderful product and my friend who bought it from me loves it on his pc based home network. Unfortunately, mine is entirely a Mac house and no matter what we tried, we couldn't get it to work with any of our computers or printers."
1,Run of the mill,"This is your avereage run of the mill dvd on all the conspiracy angled European Freemasonic lore. Nothing new here. I found it funny and odd that they would have A Prince Hall Mason say he was (so) but never had a word of dialogue about the Prince Hall Masons. Their mention of ancient Egypt was almost apologetic but in no way in depth. I would give it a 1 star but they did have a couple of woman Masons that had some what of an opinion.They mentioned Napoleon was a Mason but didn't give any background on him, I was waiting thoughout for that. They seemed to concentrate on a side lodge p2 & it's conspiracy linked to the Pope's death in Italy.People are so hungry these days for Masonic info I guess this will do well in units sold."
1,What Happened?,"Looper (Stuart David formerly of Belle & Sebastian) started out with a bang. The debut album was a great mix of spoken word pieces and and very good, well crafted pop songs that formed a wonderful, unified whole. Anyone who has seen Looper perform live can apreciate how good and talented they truly are... which is why this new album is such a let down.I am a big fan of Stuart David's work both with Looper and while in Belle & Sebastian, however ""The Snare"" is just completely uninteresting, uninspired and droning."
1,SPOILERS - The Game that tried to be a Movie,What was the plot? the cut scenes are so long that there are save points in between them. wasn't there a wedding at one point? I cleaned my room while playing the game because the cut scenes offered me that much time to do it. big boss was alive this whole time even though snake attempted to kill him twice? why was liquid glad his plan was destroyed? why was my life being depleted anytime a chick hugged me? why was the ending longer than any movie i've ever seen (as your reading this my game is still ending)? how many metaphors does it take to get a single point across? the game play would've been great if there was some game to play. i was just watching a movie that kept dragging out the ending.
1,Does not list oil ingredients,"The book lists 550 oils and what they are for with no index in the back(kind of a big to leave out when you have a list of 550). THE BOOK DOES NOT LIST INGREDIENTS,IT JUST ASSUMES YOUR TOWN HAS A GOOD OCCULT SHOP IN IT THAT WILL HAVE THEM(oh and under the same name). ALSO I COULD NOT FIND ANY DETAILED SPELL OR RITUAL DESCRIPTIONS. As a pagan I found this to be of no use to me and I felt like I was ripped off."
1,sellout.,Sounds to me like their audience was waning so they added some cheesy modern death metal elements which is really sad. Combining this generic death metal garbage with the classic macabre sound just does not work. Very disappointing.Check out their 93 cd Sinister Slaughter. That's a masterpiece.
1,"The most depressing ""comedy"" I've ever seen","If your an anti-social punk rocker, you might just like this movie. There were some funny scenes, but the two girls are annoying. They just walk around cussing and complaining about how terrible life is and how everybody is so stupid. Buscemi was good (a little strange) but the guy with the numchucks was the best. Unfortunately, you only see ""numchucks"" for a total of 90 seconds. I think the funniest scene was when Buscemi goes into the convenient store steaming mad and tries to knock over the food shelf. He didn't see those numchucks coming now did he? Rent it if you must see it."
1,Unreliable,This product was delivered defective. I didn't want to get a replacement to avoid further frustration.
1,Poor quality printer,"I purchased my Canon S330 printer in late January of 2003. I used it to print the occasional shipping lable or report, no photos. The print head has failed three times in the past six months. First it stopped printing black right in the middle of a job(it suddenly started printing black again after about 3 weeks.) Then it stopped printing magenta, again, right in the middle of a job. As of January 2004 it stopped printing both black and magenta. After getting a run-around from customer service(telling me the standard ""do a cleaning, etc."")I was told I need a new print head, which will cost about $60 plus $40 ""labor"" to install at a ""certified Canon repair center"". Of course there isn't one near me and my printer would have to be shipped to one at my cost. It's cheaper for me to just buy a new printer. The only good things I can say about this printer is that it was fast and the ink is cheap."
1,"Interesting at times, but lacking in depth","I was severly disappointed with this book. Maybe if the author had named the book ""An Overview of the Early Years of Court During the Reign of Louis XIV"" I would not have been so let down. The author spends relatively little time focusing on Athenais and too much time on the other court players. I came away not having learned anything new about this intriguing woman. Further, the impression I got is that the author did little new, in-depth research and just spewed out well-known facts, dates, and names. While it is not a terrible book, if you have any prior knowledge of the reign of Louis XIV, then I would not recommend this book as it is only a reiterration of commonly known facts."
1,Relieved to see I'm not the only disappointed customer!,"I should have checked this showerhead out as thoroughly as I usually check things out, but I was so excited to see it at a reasonable price compared to other filtering showerheads, that I grabbed it without research.I, too, like the other reviewers have had to start looking for something else after just 5 months because the rubber rings have stretched out and no longer hold the showerhead in the holder. The showerhead is too heavy for the mount that comes with it and it keeps falling down on our heads. The showerhead makes a high pitched squealing noise that my previous shower head did not make.I have a 4 yr. old daughter and she can no longer shower ""like a big girl"" because of the potential for injury. I see that the ShowerTek company is not much help, but I'm going to E-mail them next and let them know about their inferior product. Do not waste your money on this product. You will be sorely disappointed, I'm sure!"
1,Too late to return it once I realized its not authentic.,All I have to say is check the box and do your comparisons with an authentic FHI to the one that you are looking into purchasing on ebay/amazon. I am stuck with a piece of junk that dries my hair out and does not hold up in any weather. Be careful. My stylist uses the FHI platform in the salon and I've tried the runway. They work amazing. So imagine my surprise when my FHI turns out to look nothing like theirs and doesn't even compare in performance.
1,AHHHHHHHHH!!!! HORRIBLE!,"I love kate bush, and when I saw ""tribute"" I was hoping for a bunch of artists doing their own takes on Kate songs. To me this album is HELL. It's just one woman trying to sound like Kate Bush and bring nothing original to the songs. Blah. I naver want to hear this album again."
1,great...for a while,"I have had a couple of these bottles and I've used them for a few years. The CamelBak concept works very well, but the problem comes after repeated use. Mildew builds up in the bite valve and in the plastic mechanism that holds the valve. It is very hard to clean because the mildew grows in areas that are too small to fit a brush or q-tip into. Soaking it in bleach doesn't work either. After a while the bottle becomes just plain unsavory. I've had to throw mine out and start over with a differently designed water bottle."
1,DVD is poor.,"I ordered two copies of this DVD. I love the show and the story line. However, both DVDs I purchased had significant flaws in the viewing of the DVD, starting around the 2 hour to 2 hour 15 minute mark. At that point the DVD would stop, start, stop, frereze, start - continuously. The DVD could no longer be watched. Since it happened in two different DVDs I purchased, I assume there is somed problem with the actual recording, altho I am going to try it in my computer DVD player."
1,Not even worth checking out of the library,"The first three Hitchhikers books are probably the most hilarious books I have ever read. The fourth, _So Long and Thanks for all the Fish_ was a great disappointment, and lacked the brilliant spark of the first three. _Mostly Harmless_ is mean spirited and largely devoid of humor. I think Adams not only has lost interest in these books, but has lost his muse. Sad to see him writing such junk as _Mostly_, I would presume just for the money. I felt cheated for buying this book, and I cannot even recommend checking it out of the library, as surely your time must be worth something"
1,just turn a box fan on low and there you have the sound this machine makes.,"i really was hoping this would replace the box fan in my infants room, especially since it's getting cooler out. NO NO NO! if you have been using a box fan to drown out noise, keep using it and skip this. i was really expecting more, but i would compare the sound this makes to a box fan on the LOWEST setting. this is with the marpac on as high as it would go, too..it just doesn't do what i need it to. sending it back. disappointed."
1,Have I missed something?,"I thought perhaps that my book was missing a last chapter until I read a few other reviews. What happened to Jean-Baptiste? Crime novels should tie up the endings. I got the feeling that the publishing deadline arrived before the book ended! I was enjoying the book up to the last 2 chapters - very odd to say the least. Was expecting some confrontation with Scarpetta and J-B.Having enjoyed most of Patricia Cornwell's previous books, (especially Jack the Ripper and Post Mortem) I found this one very disappointing."
1,"Conan The ""Emo"" Barbarian","Why paint his eyes black?Emo look ruined it for me. The movie was bad and really was a wasted reboot/remake (just like every other lately). Hollywood should stop looking for the past and look ahead, so many creative minds and Hollywood wastes their time doing remakes which bomb for the most part. Conan The ""Emo"" Barbarian sucks!"
1,Live at Carnegie Hall is dull!,Recording lacks any originality or the depth of feeling of Indian music!
1,like rubbernecking,"If you've ever driven by a horrible car accident and couldn't help but look, you'll know what reading this book is like. It's shock-value scenes are deployed for mere fascination, nothing else. The man character, Patrick Bateman, is wholly unidentifiable as anything close to a member of the animal kingdom, pathologic or not. Mr. Ellis refuses to give any substance or insight into his character, but instead exploits our perceptions of evil and godlessness to spin a useless tale of depravity. No insight, resolution or explanations, only bewildering implausabilities which make us wonder ""why bother?"""
1,Burn your money. Don't buy this book,A complete waste of time and energy ... Whoever published this should be ashamed... And I am the fool who bought it
1,Disapppointing,"A few good things, but she's lost her edge AND I find it impossible to identify AT ALL with women who regularly have themselves stitched up here and there, Botoxed, massaged, PT-ed...Plus I've never made $150,000+ per year so I feel like I live in another cosmos.Besides, I live in France, where real faces are appreciated.constance rodrigue"
1,Dissapointment,"I have to say this film was a total dissapointment. Yes it had specail effects, but it was boring and it seemed to have lost the plot. I am a Star Wars fan, and i was looking forward to seeing this, and i saw it twice at the cinema and i still fell short changed. I will not be buying this one and i hope that the next one will be much better."
1,Goes back and forth between pathetic and funny. Too much of the former.,"I don't for a second believe that Burroughs is telling the truth about his life -- but I gobbled up his other books anyway. He's funny and there's something endearing about the way he writes -- yes he's gay, and yes that necessarily ""colors"" his worldview -- but talking about a job you hate, a family you loathe, and a partner who amazingly tolerates you are necessarily universal.That said, he lapses here. This isn't as approachable a book and the narrator is isn't so much funny as he is unlikeable. By turns smug and arrogant, too much of this feels self-indulgent. Chafingly, distractingly so."
1,Book Review,"Moves a bit slow for me, but an interesting book to read. Makes you wonder how often in real life the situations are repeated."
1,"C'mon, get real - this is a bad album.","If this album wasn't by an ex-Beatle it would have quickly been relegated to the dust bin. There are exactly three songs on this that are tolerable - Hari's On Tour(no vocal!-good) - Simply Shady, and Dark Horse. The cover of Bye Bye Love is one of the most pathetic covers I have ever heard. Maya Love is boring, and Ding Dong is just about as dumb as the song title implies. A real misfire for Geroge on this one."
1,Awful! Author failed at a woman's voice!,"So lame. I was disgusted by his insensitive female protagonist. His narrator says she'll end a conversation, like a first trimester pregnancy, if the guy she's talking to doesn't make six figures. Yuck. Totally unbelievable."
1,sounds okay,"I have seen the cover box for this video on ebay. It looks kind of weird, thats probably because its in the everchanging style of the british boxes. This video will have the same director, narrator, music, and activities like Steamies vs. Diesels. I'm okay with that so long as they release normal videos with the music we love, no activities, and all of the characters. It looks like we should expect two normal videos and two wacked out videos like Steamies vs. Diesels per year. Thats okay, but HIT is a weird company. The stories should be okay, but that's it."
1,Best Hollywood Cheesey Steak,"This movie embarassed me. No joke, when Pacino gave the speech in the black church about the killing of the black boy, he out-blacked the blacks. Truly cringe inspiring. And the cliches! Only the credits stopped them. The predictability! Awesome, I felt as if I'd co-authored this piece of. I only kept watching out of a fascination with Pacino's rug and to see what other fine character actors would appear, only to be under-utilized and poorly directed."
1,Died after 6 months; beware Philips product warranty,"Nothing spectacular, but it did the job, ie, play Region 1 & 2 DVDs. Picture OK, about what you'd expect at this price. But picture started to flicker after 6 months, then player died completely. Called Philips, they told me warranty on 642/37 expires after 3 months, after that the only option you have is get a new unit at a 20% discount, and minus the region-free capability, which is dealer-installed. My advice: Skip this player, go for a brand with better product quality & customer service in the same price range, eg, Panasonic DVD-S47 or Panasonic DVD-S27."
1,"Not Bad, But Stick with the Color Model","You get much better resolution and viewing with the color camera, and there is no real improved low light capability in this model over the color model."
1,Do yourself a favor...purchase the 2nd edition.,"Why ExamCram chose to publish this work I have no idea. In short, it contains less content than the 2nd edition, which covers the same test. The chapters aren't as well-written, and the outline is more confusing. Do yourself a *big* favor..purchase the 2nd edition by Waters, Rees, and Coe. You'll get more bang for your buck..much more bang."
1,"More, More, More is a fantastic song, but....","I was really rooting for Andrea True, really I was. One of my personal all time favorites, ""More, More, More"", is easily a 5 star song (and makes this buy actually worth it), but it is the only good track. The rest was pretty embarrassing disco cheese. It would have made a good soundtrack to a late 70's roller boogie porno movie had one ever been made. I suggest finding the title track on a compilation of disco hits for more enjoyment. Looks like Miss True finally got some respect this year, though, as the band Len sampled some of ""More, More, More"" on it's hit song ""Steal My Sunshine""."
1,"Hardly ""Global""","This supposedly ""global"" adapter did not fit my Satellite U205 laptop. The plug was too big to fit in the port."
1,"I appreciate what he attempted, but...","I appreciate what the author was attempting to do, but do not feel the book succeeds. It is too dry to read on its own (as a sort of William Safire-style curmudgeon rant on language), and not comprehensive enough to be a useful desk reference.In addition, the first 30 or so pages are actually a biography of the author (who died a few years ago) by one of his colleagues. Perhaps to someone researching Lasch himself (who was, admittedly, a renown academic) this material would be interesting, but it isn't in the context of language reference."
1,Con Air Infiniti Model HC701,"The Hair clipper worked great the first time I used it to cut my own hair, but the next time I went to use it it went crazy. I was cutting my son's hair and the digital display went blank, and it started to run wide open and would not turn off. It will not work at all now. I had to send my son to school with half a hair cut.....don't laugh it's not funny!"
1,gearwrench locking flex,"I thought they would be really handy, but where the locking mechanism is located, (on each side at the joint) I think I will end up breaking it off from catching on whtever is next to the bolt I am taking out, I almost broke one off the first time I tried using one of them. I wish I could return them and get the reversible set before I break one.."
1,Save your money,"After our purchase of Cinderella last year, ""Santa"" brought Belle this Christmas - we should have learned our lesson - our 4 year old who is great with her hands has a difficult time dressing these dolls and keeping up with all of the parts needed to operate them. In addition, Belle's arm cracked off which really surprised me considering the cost of the doll. After putting it off as long as possible, I took Belle to the store to see if ""Santa"" had left his extras (with receipt dated 11/02) and after going through manager after manager, we received a refund because there were no more on the shelf - Wonder Why?? Wrote Santa a letter asking for a replacement, thank goodness I have read these reviews before blowing the money on another."
1,"Say it isn't so, Dan!","Others here have adequately filled you in on enough of the plot of A Winter Haunting, so I won't rehash what's already been written. What I will say is this: if you are a true Summer of Night fan, if you've read it more than once and have enjoyed the other exploits of its characters as adults (Fires of Eden, for example)you may be sorely disappointed in this book, as I am. SPOILER .....After all is said and done, this ""update"" on Dale leaves the reader with the sad possibility that none of the true horror elements of ""Summer"" ever happened, and that this it (Summer) was Dale's memoir which has been tweaked by the ghost of Duane to spin it into a horror tale.Dan, oh Dan, say it isn't so!!"
1,Go to Sleep,"This soundtrack was sadly disappointing. I was expecting a faithful soundtrack from the movie-this is not it! There are some eerie songs, but most on this album are the happy ones (which are few in the movie) and are not faithfully recreated. Indeed, the movie's music was by far in comparison on the better part of my imagination and soothing music. The lacking of this soundtrack I made my own copy-straight from the DVD. So I have a 78-minute faithful, and completely questionable, moods for all my devious pleasures. ..."
1,Fraudulent labeling ?,"My wife purchased 3 sets of this flatware at a local Target store, and we too experienced problems with rust. I remembered from a college class 20 years ago that stainless steel is non-magnetic, while ordinary steel will stick to a magnet. So I tested the flatware with a magnet, and sure enough it *is* magnetic. I'm pretty sure that means that, despite the labeling, it is not stainless steel. We haven't yet complained to Target, but we surely will. (I just found out about the problem tonight, and I did a Google search on ""hampton target stainless"", which brought me to this site and all the bad reviews.)"
1,"Movie wonderful, DVD treatment horrible","There is now doubt about the quality of this film. Ths issue is the substandard encoding or transfer used for this new DVD. Through out the first 40 min. of the film, there are intances of both horizontal and vertical blanking - a static which appears on all vertical and horizontal lines. It is also obvious that this film was mastered from a film print and not the interpositive -- the blacks are fuzzy and the dark scenes look as if they have a scrim or screen over them. I also noted two instances of sound drop outs.All of these are issues which could have been fixed. It's very sad that greater care wasn't taken with this film, and at the price point which Winstar is charging, they should have at least tried to get it right.Hey Winstar -- third times the charm....."
1,Not recommended,"Throughout the first part of this book it continually rains, which made me more than once wonder when all the cardboard characters were going to dissolve and wash away. This book is simply bad, and the part that should have been most interesting, the part spent in the past, contains too limited locations, plot, and characters to really satisfy. Several of the plot points are so artificial and poorly resolved that the book becomes an exercise in frustration. I cannot recommend this book."
1,Sad,"This show has nothing to do w/ Enlightenment, but lots of stupidity. It is a sad portrayal of slavery to american corprotocracy."
1,Keep Off Cat Repellent,"I am not happy with this product at all. It said it would last for 24 hours and it didn't last a good 2 hours. I had to respray the area I was trying to keep my cat from over and over. He about came immune to the spray too. I was trying to keep him from going under the bed. He is tearing the lining from the box spring. Yet when I sprayed after the 2nd or 3rd time, he started going under the bed. I won't buy this product again."
1,Do you value your time? Yes? Good. Avoid this movie!,"Despite the fact that Eye of the Beholder has two relatively capable and interesting young actors, it fails to perform the job a good movie does...to entertain. The main problem with this movie is the fact that it is not coherent. It lacks a degree of structure and clarity necessary to allow the viewer to comprehend the story. Most of the so-called 'developments' are absurd and unbelievable. Why does Ewan McGregor suddenly become so obsessed with Ashley Judd? What happens to the mental projection of his daughter? What happens at the end? Does she die? What is she saying to him?...it's incomprehensible. I am a very intelligent person...I read Dostoevsky and Nietzsche for pleasure...but this movie made no sense to me."
1,Read this book if you enjoy infomercials.,"As someone whose spouse has Parkinson's, I am always heartened and inspired by news of those who can ""beat"" the disease. I wish the author well, but the ""book"" he has written is little more than an ""infomercial"" for the sprays sold by his company. Buyer beware. . . . He offers virtually no scientific evidence to support these claims."
1,Sad there's no zero instead of one for stars,"I am thoroughly disappointed and quite angry. I ordered this movie in good faith and planned to enjoy it with family. I have every Christmas Carol from 1935 (England)original to Disney's Jim Carey version. After convincing the family this was one more worth watching, it plainly stunk! Hardly a third into it, freezes and skips kicked in. What a piece of crap and huge disappointment. To make matters worse, I I I I I have to pay for the $2.98 shipping to return the garbage for a refund?! Just to get a replacement??! I didn't even ask for my money back! All I wanted was the DVD I ordered in good working order. I get a piece of crap and I have to pay and it ruined our Christmas traditions night. Don't take the risk, it isn't worth it, find the movie at Walmart or somewhere else. It is a great movie and a good George C. Scott rendition, just do NOT trust this vendor."
1,Don't buy this!,"I got this thing as a wedding gift. I attempted to use it after returning from my honeymoon. It completely corrupted the memory card and of the 80 pictures on the card, only 12 were readable. The camera then could no longer read them either. It's bad enough that it destroyed a $30 memory card, but it lost all of my honeymoon pictures which are irreplaceable. I've had some poor products before, but this one goes down as the worst of all time."
1,Unplayable,Please note that this game will not run unless you have a top of the line video card. It would not work with a Nvidia GeForce 6200 card.
1,"GIVE ME A BREAK. , AND ONCE AGAIN NOOOOO STARS?","I GUESS AT THIS POINT THE GREAT POPULARITY OF JIMI HENDRIX, THIRTY YEARS AFTER THE FACT, IS NOW SUBJECT TO ANYONE THAT WANTS TO RECORD AND USE HIS GREATNESS TO DECIEVE MUSIC LOVERS. I GUESS JOE PESCHI IS NEXT IN LINE!"
1,The storyline was interesting but it did not meet my expectations,This movie had an interesting storyline. So I bought it. But it did not meet my expectations. I did not even stand watching it 'till the end.
1,Utter Junk,"I paid 9.50 for the red version, as I didn't want to pay $25 for the alternative. However, this will wind up being more expensive as I'll toss it in a few months, whereas the better one will last for years.This thing is flimsy, there was a flaw in the inner metal and the handle will surely break soon.I'd have returned it but I accidentally tossed the box."
1,Worst cell phone I have ever owned,"Nothing wrong with mine specifically i.e. it is not in need of repair. Neat design. Camera is useless. Has MUCH MUCH worse reception than OLDER Sprint phones in same areas. I drop calls constantly. Hard to believe older phones worked better. Battery life is horrific, worse I have ever had across all cell phones I have owned. Gives about 30 seconds battery warning before shutting down. I compare this to same service provider, same locations, older Sprint phones and it is absolutely terrible. Sub-par is an understatement. You'd be better off buying a refurb Sanyo. At least it will perform basic functions properly."
1,"Paris, Pleeeeeze.....","Frankly, I've had enough of this woman. There are 2 types of persons who reside in high society; those that revel in their image (which, sorry, gets old), and those that lay low, are highly intelligent, and quite eccentric. Certain persons in history are quite interesting to read about, however, Paris is not one of them. She has a horrible sense of fashion, limited vocabulary, and is rediculously boring. Yet, her publiscist is someone who deserves ""mad props."" The ability to market a moron and make bank off of her is remarkable. But, the purchasing of Hilton paraphernalia by the masses is simply more evidence of the dumbing down of Americans. Oh, and I'm a real platinum blonde - do you think Paris would even understand these words?"
1,Where are the square ones????,"Where are the square pops shown on the package? Bring them back. They were better. And no cherry flavored in 2 of the bags! Get it together, Hersheys."
1,#1? Really?,"First of all, who ever could vote this ahead of Neutral Milk Hotel is crazy or hard of hearing. You listen to the 30 sec samples and hear 90% of the album. The partial songs are short with intentional poor quality, I hope. Very weak."
1,Oh well....,Knowing that God will judge at the last days....I pray for the reviewers that praise this book and hope they will repent of their wrong. And may God have mercy on the souls who approved this blasphemy to be written.
1,Disapointed,I bought this game a while back and for me It hardly had any appeal afterwords. There are no new careers just new objects which is really dissapointing because the real draw is ;what are they gonna be promoted to? When they dont add onto that aspect it has very little appeal.
1,Not an appealing Beauty,I did not think this trilogy compared to Fifty Shades of Grey at all. The stories are totally different. This erotic take on sleeping beauty was not very facinating.
1,"I couldn't watch it the whole through, mockumentary or not.",Made it half way through but I was literally falling asleep (at 2pm in the afternoon). I love Joaquin Phoenix but no one wants to watch someone parading around like a jerk like that. I'm just happy to know that it was in fact a mockumentary and he's not really like that.
1,Do they even like LINKIN PARK??????,"Well, out of all of the tribute albums that I've heard this one definately earns the right to be called a complete waste of time and effort. Does the vocalist (who's trying to compare to Mike Shinoda) on the Points of Authority track even know the lyrics?"
1,Very Visual,"I found this to be very visual but also disappointing --- I simply don't understand or appreciate what the director was trying to say --- from what other people have said in their reviews, I guess I fall into the latter category of not quite ""getting it"" --- that's life..."
1,Poor service,Placed the order on May 1 and it's now June 1. Still haven't received any magazine in the mail.
1,Only My Opinion,"I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AND IT LOOKED LIKE THEY WERE USED AND SINCE I'D READ ABOUT THAT FROM OTHERS USERS OF THE BEN WA BALLS, I DECIDED TO CLEAN THEM AND GIVE THEM A TRY. WELL I HAD THEM A GOOD WEEK. THEY CHIPPED AND TARNISHED SO I THREW THEM AWAY. I GAVE THE PRODUCT A 2 BECAUSE I THINK UNDER DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES, THEY PROBABLY WOULD HAVE WORKED. IN FACT IF I THOUGHT I COULD GET THEM TO SEND ME A REPLACEMENT PAIR, I WOULD GO FOR IT!"
1,Big Dropoff,"There is a huge dropoff in quality from Vol 1. of the Whistle Test clips to this package, simply because there is a huge dropoff in the quality of the artists between the two volumes. Sorry, but Loggins and Messina, Average White Band, Jim Croce, Hall & Oates, Thomas Dolby and Simply Red just don't match up to Bill Withers, Captain Beefheart, Talking Heads, XTC, Iggy Pop and the Specials. The commentary from the show's hosts and the various musicians is still enjoyable and enlightening, as on the first collection, and this whole volume is almost made worthwhile simply for the stunning clip of the sublime Judee Sill sitting at the piano and painfully/beautifully singing her majestic ballad. And Jools Holland is a lot of laughs, both when talking about the Squeeze clip that is included and in the clip itself. So there's some nice moments here, but I really don't want to own anything that includes Loggins and Messina on it."
1,Bring back the original design.,"Please, Vacu Vin, won't you bring back the old design?! Those slightly softer ones with the slit on the top and three ridges on the bottom? The ones that don't, on occasion, slip up in the bottle, leaving wine oxidized -- the ones that don't fall out in transit, spoiling a cooler's content with spilt wine? I have a couple of the old ones left and am guarding them with great care, so as not to lose one of these precious, quality stoppers. Won't you please make these again? You could even call them ""deluxe"" and sell them for 50% more. One bottle of spilt or stale wine would make it worth a return to quality -- and I have had three such disappointment with this design."
1,Not his best,"This is not Wolfe's best as it is basically an extended rant against the influence of Bauhaus architecture, which, while somewhat entertaining, doesn't really explain much. For a better analysis of what Harvard art historian Sigfried Giedion called ""the hanging curtain of glass,"" try his outstanding book, Space, Time and Architecture, which does a much better job of tracing and conceptualizing the evolution of 20th century architecture."
1,Teeny bopper show,"I bought season 1 when it came out and i thought it will be good. To my my surprise, it was not. It was only 1 episode named ""Asylum"" of the 22 episodes.I gave up watching this teeny bopper show after watching all the 21 poor episodes, which i think lacked, suspense, good story, acting and so on. If more episodes was like Asylum, i think it would've been better.I will not see a episode of this show anymore. I heard this show was influenced by The X-Files. I only thing that alike was them going around solving crimes and helping people. I think this show deserves my rating 1 out 5."
1,Disappointing Read,"Considering her unique relationship to the Peterson family, I expected more insight into the family dynamics. While I'm sure that she knew and loved Laci, her claims of condering her a ""sister"" and the extreme closeness she shared with her & Scott seems unlikely, since she never once visited them at their home, nor did she ever meet Laci's family. This was a tragedy for all involved, but the book is superficial, and contains many facts that were well reported in the media. Save your money and buy Catherine Crier's book, a much better take on the Peterson investigation and trial."
1,"Idog, not what we expected.","Idogs are cute but not what we expected them to be. We bought two of what seemed to be something so very hard to come by this past Christmas. Our kids felt ""so so"" about them. I think the advertisers just built them up to much. Over all they are cute and do light up well with music."
1,Broke after a few uses,At first this seemed like a great product. After a month or so or use one of the attachments started to pop off of the hose during use. Nothing like having water shower you during numerous times of doing chores.
1,Why?,"Given the fact that the subject matter should have been fascinating and that Alan Rickman was the star, why was I disappointed in this movie? I'll tell you why--because the events in the film were confusing enough without a barely audible dialogue. By the end of the movie I wondered why I sat through the whole thing. Go ahead and rent this at your local video store if you don't have anything else to do, but don't buy it."
1,Bad programming and design ruins the game,The aircraft controls and gameplay in this game are absolutely horrible! They should take a good lesson from Halo on how to design aircraft controls.The player vs player combat is flawed as well. Here they need to learn a good lesson from Quake 3 in terms of gameplay.I bought this main game but WILL NOT buy the core combat expansion as I think this game is not worth it.
1,I read it but am afraid to tell my friends,This is a compelling mystery remixing the grail mythos. However Mr. Brown's characters and their emotional interactions are preadolescent.
1,They leak!,"I bought these cups because they seemed like ""big kid"" cups. They leak. No matter how you put the lid on, they leak. Sadly, the cheap, ""throw-away"" kind work better. This was a waste of money."
1,Like trying to have a conversation with ADD child,"I couldn't follow this book, subjects and timelines jumped around more than the Easter rabbit! I didn't like this style of writing and didn't finish the book (a rare occurrence)."
1,Fun movie - bad DVD,"This is a fun Paramount horror film that has been on my ""I hope it comes out on DVD"" list for years. The movie is enjoyable, but don't expect it to be as good as a classic like DRACULA or FRANKENSTEIN. If you enjoy films like THE BRUTE MAN or CAPTIVE WILD WOMAN, you will enjoy THE MONSTER AND THE GIRL. So why only one star? The DVD has audio drop outs starting at 8 minutes into the film. Universal and Amazon are aware of the issue, but the problem has still not been fixed. It starts in the beginning courtroom scene where the prosecutor is saying the word ""fingerprints"" but you only get to hear ""finger..."" It continues from there with frequent audio dropouts. It is a problem wit the DVD because the old VHS tape does not have these flaws. If you must have the film on DVD, then buy it, but beware that the static dialogue is annoying!"
1,"Easy to use, but battery and cable poor quality","This digital photo safe work very easy and friendly. The problem is that the poor quality of the cable and the battery, the limitation of battery life is very short, so it force me to buy an extra battery, to have the work done. I'm a semi-pro photographer and I choose to work with a mini note book, instead using this item.I don't recomended because of the quality of the power surce."
1,Utter Garbage,"Some of the scenery was nice.That's it. That's a far as I can go to find anything positive about this film.This film did not entertain, inform, provoke thought, or move me in any way. I could close my eyes, throw a dart at a listing of movies and have no worries that I would find one better than this.The trailer tricks you into thinking there may be some sort of story to be told. Even the first 10 minutes would lead you to believe this. Nope...don't bother waiting because nothing ever develops. The scene on the boat? Could that 30 minutes be any more mind numbingly boring? Yes, they're on a boat for a long time...we get it...let's wrap that bit up in 5 minutes vs 30 minutes of these guys staring at each other.Wait, once they get off the boat the story will get better...right? Nope. More nice scenery and that's it.Just utter garbage. I can't adequately put into words just how terrible I still feel after wasting my time watching this film. I expected better from Amazon."
1,More for Hippies...,"Not a bad book at all! I am not a hippie though. If you are, which is perfectly great, this is the book for you! It is all about finding the best deals and an honest review on all hotels, hostels, restaurants, night life and of course ""coffee houses"" hee hee!"
1,The Children of Men,"The premise was great, no new babies being born, the people of Earth now sterile, but it took a wrong turn. Another reviewer said it best about the ending, she wrote herself into a corner. I kept thinking about what would happen if no babies were born, how people would carry on, where all the people left would go etc. It could have great if she had developed that aspect, rather than the 5 dissidents angle. I'll try PD James again. This was a quick read, 3 days. Next up is The Pillars of the Earth, hearing great things about that."
1,zero stars for this one,"I am a big Muddy Waters fan and this one completely missed the mark.I love a lot of the guitarists on this disc but only the Jeff Beck stuff kind of works.The drumming just out and out stinks, no swing whatsoever.I would order up ""Hard Again"" or one of the Chess compilations and plug into the real deal."
1,Worse then expected,"I had hoped ""Can Holmes save London from dinosaurs?"" would be a rip-off of a Professor Challenger tale with Holmes replacing Doyle's other series character. No such luck. The dinosaurs turn out to be robots created by a previously unknown brother of Holmes who also cured himself of paralysis by gadgetry that would cost a small fortune today, and now seeks revenge on ex-partner Lestrade.Somehow Holmes knew this early on from staring at something on the ground.There's no denying the ending is exciting, but it has no place in a Sherlock Holmes film. It's also is too similar to the one used in the far superior ""Great Mouse Detective"", which really was a cartoon.I don't care if the producers were looking to cash in on the recent theatrical film or not. I only care if the film is good or not. This one is not."
1,Fun but unsafe,"We got one of these for our 3 year old at Christmas last year. There is no doubt that our daughter loved it, had great fun riding it, and found it easy to move on to a regular bicycle by the end of the summer. The problem is that the material is incredily shoddy. One day while she was riding it, the entire front handlebar/wheel assembly popped completely off, sending our daughter head-first onto the pavement. Fortunately she was wearing a good helmet (which was split completely in 2) or else the outcome could have been catastropic.This is a great idea, and there may be better-quality balance bikes out there. But this particular model is just too hazardous to let your kid ride on it."
1,Leaked,"Seemed like a good idea, but it leaked incessantly no matter how much I tightened even with Teflon tape on the threads. I returned it."
1,Songs for the Deaf (tone deaf....),"I'm jumping on the bandwagon - this album is a waste! I cringed listening to the clips provided. The vocals sound as though they were recorded while the singer was in the shower (and that's not just from the poor quality of the clips provided). Tributes are supposed to be different perspectives on an existing song, not feeble attempts to perfectly recreate the vocal stylings of the original singer. The music behind the singer is not bad - not exactly Incubus but a little different flavor. However, that is all but subdued by the grating performance by the vocalist. Until an ""Encomium""-style tribute is released in honor of Incubus, stick with the original."
1,"Looks good, but that's it!!!","The Jabra EarBroom has become real popular...I had a plantronics headset with my previous phone, but since I changed phones and needed a headset with a 2.5mm jack I thought I'd try the EarBoom.I travel often and found that the ear peices really didn't fit snug and stay in my ear. When I talk to someone, they can hear much more background noise while I'm driving than you could on my Plantronics headset. The voice quality from the ear peice is okay, but as I mentioned it feels like it's always about to fall out. If you're in a quiet room, the sound quality from my voice mic still isn't very good. I'll be heading to the plantronics site, their quality is good, but the ear pieces fell off of my headset frequently.....at least people could hear me and I could hear them clearly though."
1,My Vote for THE WORST GAME OF ALL TIME,"When I ask people, they usually say either ""The Simpsons: Hit and Run"" or ""School Tycoon."" I, on the other hand, have played both those games...-School Tycoon has better graphics.-School Tycoon lets you know what's happening.-School Tycoon has a video at the beginning to get you started.SIM-ISLE, on the other hand, is one where you don't know what you're supposed to do at all EVER, and there's no step-by-step tutorial. I wouldn't have given this a rating (if they didn't make me) because I don't feel it can be rated.Thank you and avoid."
1,FM RADIO DOES NOT WORK AT ALL,Mp3 part is great but FM radio will not receive any station without noise. My digital walkman does receive in the same location 25 stations with perfect sound.I tryied 3 units and the same problem. If you will be lucky you will get 1 station out of 25 and still with noise. Piece of junk.
1,A perfect candidate for MST3K??,"whew what a stinker. I don't really care if Welles was the first to use a certain camera angle, that doesn't create excellence in my book. Somebody should re-release this with some sort of on-screen drinking game, it might make it a little more tolerable - of course it may just depress you into a suicidal alcoholic stupor and you'll end up bitterly bemoaning the loss of your childhood crap you gave up for wealth and power. It isn't even that I dislike Welles, I enjoyed him in the Third Man and The Muppet Movie (<---joke). Good movies tell stories capable of engaging the audience, this didn't it presented an obituary with a lot of bitching. Look up something by Lang, Jodorowsky, anyone."
1,cheap,"seems poorly made, & the volume doesn't get as loud as your ipod usually could (without this). it's okay if you listen to talk FM i guess."
1,miserable to load and reload...,"I installed the ""personalized"" version that they sent me in the mail as a past user... you had to either log into the website to purchase or purchase over the phone... I made the mistake of purchasing over the phone, then could not get it to install, it wanted to constantly re-direct me to the website and have me re-purchase it (again). Was able to access on-line support OK, but they didn't have a clue what I was talking about. Called the 800 number, they got me going, but when I went to re-install on my laptop, same problem, had to call the 800 number back for instructions to re-load. (800 number only open 9-5 weekdays, not when I work on my taxes) Works great when you get it installed, but miserable to install. Ordered State disc, that installed no problem, worked fine. Wish they'd go back to ""buy it off the shelf, put the disc in, load it and do your Taxes""."
1,A flawed product,I'm returning this product. I couldn't get out the starting gate because of poor documentation. It was very unclear how to transfer maps from a PC to a Palm T3 SD Card. Other reviewers point out that you can't do address lookups on the PDA which limits the usefullness of this package. I was planning to use this software with Delorme's Earthmate GPS receiver. I'm now looking at the TomTom T3 GPS offering instead.
1,"High hopes, but very disappointed","Lightscribe isn't the most importent thing in a DVD burner, but it's the reason I went with this particular product instead of a number of alternatives. As an aftermarket addition to my Dell 4550 computer I can tell you after many many hours of frustration that although it burns DVDs just fine, the lightscribe does not work. It will not recognize Verbatim or Memorex Lightscribe DVDs, including the free Lightscribe DVD that came with the product. I have tried SureThing (bundled with this product) and Nero, to no avail. I updated the system software off the Lightscribe site and there is no newer update for the 740i. I finally called HP to try to talk with someone and was told that technical support for this product will cost $30 a call !!!!!!!!! Goodby HP."
1,Tragic and depressing,I had started to get together with some ladies from church to watch this series from the beginning but this second in the series was too depressing for the women. Now they don't want to watch the rest of the series. They'd rather watch comedies!
1,Pictured Filter is not the one I received!,"Like some customers before me I had problems with this item. In fact, I called customer service (BEFORE I ordered the item) to make sure that the item pictured would be the item I received. Alas, it was not--the kind of filter really does matter. So I called again and was told that the matter would be looked into--here's hoping someone does their job and keeps their promise!"
1,Killed It Halfway Through,"Reminded me of the Bourne movies, which I don't like. Gritty and realistic, but the fun or thrills, like the WMD, are nowhere to be found."
1,"SO SADDEN, SHOCKED, AND MAD",I was so excited to get my new fan. At first it worked great I loved it. At the end of the first day of use I went to move it and the plastic joint where you attach the pole to the base broke right off. I was sadden and shocked that it broke so easy from just moving it and setting it down. Again it worked fine until I set it back down. ?? Now I have to find a way to fix it!! :((
1,"Not Great, but not as bad as Crossroads","Just finished reading Knife of Dreams. I was a little nervous when my husband surprised me with a copy. I didn't think book 10 was all thatgreat, and I didn't even bother picking up the prequel based on all the horrible reviews it received. In my opinion it's not as bad as book 10, but not as good as Fires of Heaven, The Great Hunt, etc.I enjoy reading about Mat's courtship with Tuon, so I especially found those few chapters intriguing, but aside from that nothing inspiring happened. Perrin rescues Faile. Who didn't see that coming? Same with Elayne and her quest for the throne. Even my husband can't believe even I find her character extremely annoying."
1,"Please buy the theatrical version, pleeeeeeease!","I don't know what cut this is, I don't know who cut it, but there's a reason that it wasn't shown in the theatres. It's not funnier, in fact it takes every good joke remaining in this version (and many were cut in the um.. UNCUT version) and drags them out, beyond the point where all you want is the movie to end. Did I mention they cut out stuff from the theatrical version? Yup. This version doesn't make up for it by being more risque, it's not more violent, it's just stupid. The original theatrical release is much better. Even the extras are worse!"
1,Read this if your computers are networked,"I received this product with my new Compaq computer which is a Pentium 4, 1G Ram, running Windows XP. At home, I have a central server which all my computers are networked to access files and the DSL modem. After I installed Norton Internet Security 2002, none of my computer could access the files on the server or see each other. I called support, and the only way each computer could share files was to take off all the security settings. This defeats one of the purpose of the software- internet security. As for the virus scan, everytime I tried to retrieve a file on another computer, ie file server, my computer would freeze. I uninstalled the program and everything was fine."
1,omg...................,"i love jane austen and i really enjoy period pieces. but the main character was the WORST actress i have ever seen in my life. she was boring, weird, ugly, and never changed her expression. i dont kno how anyone could love her. i could barely understand what they were saying. a terrible film. i hated it."
1,"Thumbs, Toes, and Tears","Not Available! What do you mean Not Available! You are advertising it as a special item, sent me an email telling me so, and now you say Not Available! Does this sound strange to you??????"
1,Dissatisfied,This disc was unplayable on my computer. I returned it to the Sender (12th July) & have not received an acknowledgment of its arrival. I have the receipt of sending & await comment with dwindling patience & refund!
1,The bag broke on the first use,"We bought this for a trip to the Caribbean to hold our daughter's car seat. It held up fine on the way there but on the way back it burst at the zipper. When we went to baggage claim, the empty bag came out first with baggage tag then our car seat came out several minutes later. I'm surprised we got both back. I returned this to Amazon for a refund. It is a shame since it seemed like a very well constructed bag with heavy duty zippers and material. It may just be that we got a defective bag. I may try another one in the future (maybe they'll improve the zipper issue or I'll get a non-defective one)."
1,Warning! Does not play CD-R!,"This is a great machine, though please don't make the same mistake I did. I didn't read the fine print before ordering. If I had, I would've learned that this machine IS NOT compatible with CD-R. That is unfortunate since it is a new machine (shame on Toshiba). I gave one star so people would notice these comments before ordering. Otherwise it is a 5 star machine.You have been forewarned!"
1,Does Not Set In Reasonable Time,"I followed the directions and this product failed miserably. It looks like and has the consistency of skim milk. They say you can get it to set by holding the parts together for 1 minute. After five minutes it still does not set. So unless you have pieced you can tape together, I can't see this product working at all.I wish they had been more honest in their instructions and promises. This was a waste of money."
1,Buyer beware,"I was so excited to give this to my grandson for Christmas, Unfortunately, it does not work. It gets 1 Spanish station on the am dial and nothing at all on any fm stations. Don't waste your money on this."
1,worthless hunk of crap,I bought this to replace a dieing d-link router. It was easy to set up and started working automatically. I only have it hooked up to 2 computers. The little bastard constantly times out every day. There's a reason it's so cheap. Listen to the other reviews and don't buy it. Last time I buy Netgear.
1,Don't buy this junk,"I ordered two, thinking it was a great design. The idea is great, but somewhere this went really WRONG! I can't tell if a made in China issue or if the design is just that poor. The force required to turn these two was just crazy, they wouldn't stay on the bottle. I sprayed one with Silicone as that will usually do the trick with a plastic on plastic part. No luck! Hopkins needs to find the source of the problem and fix it or just not sell this model at all. It's total JUNK and I can't rate it lower than 1 star."
1,NO WAY JOSE YO ! PRINCESS SUPERSTAR SHOULD HAVE MORE HYPE,PRINCESS SUPERSTAR WAS A WHITE FEMAL RAPPER IN THE DAYS OF 93 AND WAS PLAYING THIS RAP GAME BEFORE EM AND SARAI EVER RELEASED THERE FIRST ALBUM. WELL TO MOVE ON NOW SARAI IS GOOD BUT TOO LATE SHE NEEDS TO CHANGE HER SOUND BECAUSE SHE SOUNDS LIKE MY GIRLFRIEND TRINA.
1,This item must be imitation did not last at all,Try to get an original Sony Lamp because the one I got here must be imitation only lasted about 3 1/2 months just enough for the warranty to be expired. it must be defected because It did not gave me any warning at all.
1,Attractive item,"Hard to read.Numbers etc.,need to be bolder or larger.Very hard to read past 5 feet."
1,"Tons of Theory & Buzzwords, Zero practical application","Lots of talk about ""mushroom-shaped business models"" and ""value constellations"", and maybe 1 good framework that is useful (the phases of supply chain efforts).Everything worthwhile is in the first couple of chapters - after that it devolves into hypothetical mumbo-jumbo without a supporting case study in sight.Great if you want to examine the possibilities, but it smacked of the late-90's ""any business model is possible"" thinking.Lots of stuff like ""in the future, businesses will have to choose who in their supply chain will do all the purchasing for every company, and share costs and revenues"". It sounded a lot like Marx's ""from each according to his ability, to each according to his need.""I was looking for practical advice on how to move my company forward. I wasted 2 five-hour flights reading this."
1,I guess it was a mystery,"In a word, Lacking. Her style of writing left me unable to appreciate the underlying story which, as a result, I found rather vacuous and inauthentic. So much so that I felt compelled to come write a review of this book so others might avoid making the same mistake I did. No offence Patricia."
1,Does not ship,"Ordered from Amazon/Shoplet, credit card was charged, waited 2 weeks no shipment. When I followed up they canceled the order saying it was no longer available, however it's still listed as in stock. don't order this one, use another vendor."
1,Not for Oral Boards,"This book would be beneficial for radiologists I am sure at some point in their career in neuroradiology. However, since most of us look at the case review series for our oral boards this is not the best book in the series for us. The first set of cases which is normally easy is actually very difficult and would be much harder than the ones I assume (hope) we will see on the oral boards."
1,Card readers will not recognize it...,"I use my camera for work and we have several uploading stations throughout my office. I tried the card on four different card readers and none of the readers recognized the card automatically, and when I attempted to manually run the drives, the computer crashed repeatedly. Pics are still stored on the card, and work fine via direct USB download from the camera, but it's much easier to just load the card into the readers than to carry around the USB cable all the time."
1,Entertaining but lacking,The book describes in great detail the author's working relationship with Kennedy. It is a one-man perception of a period of Kennedy's life.
1,Waste of time,"This book was a waste of my time. The time she spent working on this book gave her BARELY a superficial knowledge of what it is like to live on or below minimum wage. She started out with a chunk of money to help her through hard times and constantly dipped into it yet acting like she had to work hard every hour to earn it all back. Sure, her back hurt a little and she may have been ""offended"" by drug tests, but it is not even remotely a taste of what it is like to work 2 jobs and not have a house to go home too. She wanted to go rescue her co-workers from low paying jobs, but she worked and spoke with the mindset of a well off White woman who is in these situations only temporarily. I doubt she came back to her real life and stopped hiring maids or even fought her change. Poor book, her experience was quite superficial and I am surprised so many people liked it."
1,A Rip-Off,"This game tries to capitalize on the familiarity of the Pearl Harbor name.I was completely disappointed in 10 seconds and I have purchased lesser priced games knowing that there was a reason for the lower price. There is no conceivable reason for this game other than what it is, a complete rip-off!"
1,Not worth the read. Big letdown.,"The story starts off well enough with good strong characters--an ideal hero material and a tough yet vulnerable lady. Everything is moving nicely along until they get married. Once this happens, it's like both of their brains just shut down! Both of them easily get mad at the other's teasing comments until they can't even communicate with each other anymore. The villen wasn't what I expected either--a wus. This is the first book I've read by Ms. Dier and I shudder to try another!"
1,Returning . . .,"This lamp is so cute, just like the picture BUT so freakin' loud! I mean, if my 3 year old has to cover her ears to hear it . . . it isn't that great right?Plus, the on & off is weird - like you can't just press a button or turn a knob. You have to switch it in the back - then press the flower and the light & music come on . . . then to turn off the light, you have to use the switch in the back. Seems like a lot of work to turn on a lamp!I love the look - if there was a way to turn the music down, we would have kept it."
1,Awful,"I really, really hoped for something better. I am not one of those who think game-fiction is a doomed genre, but in many cases I doubt myself. When reading this book, I felt such. Not that I was expecting something well-written with a story of much complexity of substance, but I can find better fanfictions on the internet than this one. Doom the game could definitely have made an interesting book if they threw in a number of interesting characters, some kind of plot and at least a shred of writing skill. Sadly, this book has none. It is the same thing over and over again; main character goes into a room, kills monsters, finds a lever and then goes to the next room, while making snide comments.Even the Baldur's Gate books by Philip A. were better than these, and they were horrible. Do the pubishing companies have to dig out the worst possible authors for writing books based on games, just because most of the audience happens to be young?Avoid."
1,Vocals suck,"I did listen to some of this but I just can't get by thelead singers HORRIBLE voice. I can't even tell if the restof the band is any good because the vocals turned me offso bad. Vocals isn't always the high on my list as I canSOMETIMES look past lack luster vocals IF the rest is good,but it just shows how bad ""Amy Lee"" really is at singing.She really needs another job. Well, she makes money offof misguided teens so I guess she is doing fine moneywise.Honestly, I've never been so turned off by a singers voiceto the point to that I can't even tell if the rest of theband is any good. Unbelieveable. Maybe it's just that I'mnot into the goth stuff... But whatever... Just don't likeit."
1,just too big for a small hand,I should have heeded the warnings that this was not for small hands but i thought who has an oven mitt that fits? --- all of them seem to be big so I bought it anyway as my hands aren't that small. Sadly i am returning it as it is so large that when i bend my hand to grasp a pot or pan my hand bends inside the mitt but the mitt still sticks straight out. You can concentrate on grasping the inside of the mitt when you grasp something but you have to really concentrate on using it and for the price i just thought it should be easier to use. Otherwise it appears well made.
1,Worthless,"I got this for my wedding shower a few months ago. We have cats, so I thought this would be good for getting puke spots out of the carpet. The first time I used it, I found that it actually ground the cat puke deeper into the carpet, making the stain impossible to get out. The stain is still on our bedroom carpet to this day and will not come out. There is no suction at all to lift the dirty water away, which suprises me since its so freaking loud. The water basin barely had a few drops in it, and my carpet was soaking wet. Hand cleaning is much more effective and easier. Don't waste your money on this."
1,Save your Money,"The negative comments here are all valid. I just finished reading this book and feel really let down, especially by the ending. Grafton knows her alphabet, and that's about all she knows. Be warned, it's not worth the effort."
1,not as advertised,The paperback version sold here is literally a cheap laser print of low-res images downloaded from the internet. Complete ripoff.
1,an engineer's view,A worthless book from the perspective of actually doing image reconstruction from projections.
1,NO NO,I will certainly not buy this product again. I generally have a little oily face and this face wash dried my face really bad. It was a disaster. Total waste of money.
1,There's no way to go under one?,I cannot believe this! This is a horrible excuse for ANYTHING relating to sailor moon! It isn't even the original story and I personally hated it! Any americanized-only person- be my guest! But I must warn you- I've read the mangas and you had better stick with them... Never will I ever read another SM book written by an American...
1,New Quadras Hopefully Better,"This drive has been discontinued (thankfully) - and I'm now patiently waiting for the price to become somewhat competitive on the new ones. Apparently, Lacie continues to believe that they have a lock on the Apple market and can continue charging Apple prices for their inferior products.At any rate, I received two of these drives, both of which were sent back. If you want to trust 500GB worth of data to a drive that constantly makes screeching, grinding metal-on-metal scratching noises, then this is the drive for you.The Seagate drive they stuck inside the case on these drives also has notoriously bad reviews.Stay away."
1,Matlasse Full Bedspread,When I ordered the bedspread it was described as Ivory and instead it came in beige. Ivory is really what I wanted because it is a lighter color than beige. I am not crazy about the ribs down the length of the bedspread.
1,WEB3 + WEB4 = 1/2 Book,"This skimpy shallow effort is a classic example of either laziness, greed, ineptitude, or a nasty combination of many. Usually talent skips a generation, and Daddy Butterworth should know better than to have his son pitch in with such an effort, then get egg on both faces and lose much of the value of the elder's franchise.All I can say is that I was disappointed (it ends in mid-plot) and happy that I took this one out at the public library. That is to say, I wouldn't buy it for any price, and probably will be kicking the WEB Griffin habit pretty fast."
1,A real good Role Model for our kids,"I find it interesting that the author would make such a wonderful effort to help children, after having murdered parents. I wonder if he sent autographed free copies to the children of the people he murdered.I also find it interesting, that in over 20 years on death row, he was only able to write a handful of ""children's books"".That these books would find their way into our public school systems, where this man takes on the role of Martyr and Folk Hero, speaks volumes about our schools.The book is as shallow as the man who wrote it."
1,This is not the blues,"Yes, these are great ladies but they are not singing the Blues. They are singing Jazz. As far as a Jazz album goes, I rate this 5 STARS.As a Blues musician, I was truely disappointed that the producer of this CD listed it as a Blues album. There's not a Blues lick on this album.If you're looking for great ladies to sing the Blues, don't look here. If you're looking for great ladies to sing slow sad Jazz, you found it.There are those people that will disagree with me on this CD. I have read the previous reviews. I'll state again, as far as a Jazz CD, absolutely wonderful. I highly recommend. As far as a Blues CD, no way.Seeing as I am not a big fan of Jazz, I have listed my copy of this CD on Amazon.com to sell as ""Like new."" Someone out there will enjoy this CD."
1,To Scientific,Although the premise is good there is way to much scientific molecule configurations to keep your attention. It would be great if it had a section 'What to ask your Dr.'
1,Very Old Interface. Not same information as the text version,"I bought this CD because the Editorial review claims it has same information as the Text version of the book. Not true. There are only 1000 images in the CD version while the text version has 4000 images. There is only 450MB on the CD so I doubt they couldn't fit the rest of the images on CD.The interface is very old (as old as from the time of Windows 95). The scroll wheel does not work. There is no automatic spelling correction/suggestion when searching for words. You have to choose a ""spelling suggestion feature"" from themenu every time you run the program to find correct spellings. The convenient word look-up feature (right click on a word to launch the dictionary) is only available in Microsoft Word and excel. It makes more sense to have this feature available for Internet explorer. Do not buy the CD, stick with the text version."
1,Mom developed injury due to tension knob,"Got this seat in May, and by June I had bad wrist pain from the tension knob. In November I realized its from twisting the tension knob multiple times daily! I replaced the seat with the Cosco Alpha Omega (love this seat, no knob!)I saw an orthopedic physician & he said its De Quervain's disease. Yesterday I finally got a cortisone shot, as it got so bad I can't move my thumb, lift my baby without pain, or open a jar.And I'm a fitness instructor, so its not like I'm some weak whiner with fragile joints or anything!This seat was otherwise a great buy, and I put it in my husband's car, since he rarely uses it, but if you start to get achy wrists---exchange it! The only cure for De Quervain's is to stop the motion altogher. (mine went on for months before I figured it out, so if the cortisone shot doesn't work, I'll have to have surgery)I will be calling evenflo."
1,No go,Well maybe this product would work if your cat will tolerate it. My cat however will NOT eat it in her dry or wet food. Even with a smaller dose than she needs. Waste of money for me. :(
1,very bad movie,no link`s btween the tital of movie and the movie ....very very bad ????????????????!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Stay away from Refurb,Bought a Garmin 2720 refurbished unit and it is nothing but junk. Stay away from purchasing anything refurb.
1,Just keeps getting worse,"When I first got this drive, it was slow and buggy but it eventually ran. WiFi and wired subnets can cross-route so one must be disabled. Mistakes in configuration parameters can instantly disable the RAID, requiring a factory reset and loss of all data. Too many files in one directory crashes the Samba server. Built-in help pages are full of broken links and references to features that don't exist. But eventually it ran and stored data.From there it only got worse. iomega now requires Windows for firmware updates, even critical ones. One of the four Western Digital IDE drives inside has failed out of warranty. The status is ""Degraded Online Degraded."" The admin page will not say which drive it is and, even if I knew, I'd have a hard time finding a replacement. IDE drives were obsolete long before this RAID was purchased. It's now just e-waste."
1,Blu-Ray version video is weak,"The Blu-Ray version video quality is severely lacking. It isn't as bad as the Criterion ""Last Emperor,"" but it is pretty weak. There is digital artifacting and the image isn't sharp at all. The quality makes the the Blu-Ray look more like a DVD than a Blu-Ray. This is unfortunate considering the movie isn't that old, and while some people have used the excuse that it may be to make the movie look dreamy, it ends up looking cheap and badly made instead.I hope they plan to come out with a copy that is better mastered for Blu-Ray. If I were Peter Jackson, I would be ashamed to have my name on the Blu-Ray version of this film masterpiece.Please fix the awful digital mastering and make a crisp and clean transfer for the extended edition...."
1,thermostat never worked right,"I bought this a couple years ago and thought I'd chime in and describe the problem I had. I was hoping to use it to heat soup quickly, but unfortunately the thermostat didn't know about the ""warm"" setting. It would boil no matter what setting I chose. It would've been ideal if it had worked as expected. I ended up tossing it."
1,So disappointed!!!!!!!!!,"We have ordered these T-shirts for my husband three times and they are the only type that he likes but this time we are extremely disappointed. They are so much shorter and just don't fit right. They are also not near as soft as they usually are. WE would like to be able to return them but he likes everything washed before he wears it and I have already washed them. Anyway, we won't be ordering anymore. That is way too much money for the quality of the T-shirts!"
1,music was ruined by the poor quality of recording,"The MCA (AAD) recording ruined the music. I have other recordings of the same, which are superb. This CD goes into the garbage where it belongs."
1,"Devastating the Bible, Too?","This book may be a shocking expose of Charles Stanely only because Charles Stanley uses bad arguments for true doctrine. If someone chose bad arguments to prove the deity of Christ, that would not ""devastate"" the deity of Christ. Neither does this book ""devastate"" the doctrine of the security of God's saints--unless it devastates the Bible! ..."
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"Another reviewer stated this is ""a midwesterner's view of the midwest..."". That's crap.... As someone from Missouri and who's been to Cuba this movie is about as real (and insulting) if they had done Boyz in the Hood with middle aged white guys in blackface.I don't know if this is ""Hollywood's View of the midwest,"" or if the director and writer just happen to have head injuries."
1,Bag is too wide,"The quality of the bag is fine and so is the zipper that is used to close it. Holds cell phone, tube, tools and more with no problem. This issue that I have is that the bag isn't tapped narrow enough so that when I slide back on the saddle, the width of the bag is wider than my seat, thus my legs end up rubbing the bag, which is annoying/distracting when climbing hills. I'll going to keep the bag, but replace it with something that is the width of the seat."
1,A complete waste,"A complete waste, just got this, and used it twice. It came out broken the second time I used it, a complete waste of money and time on this one. Make sure not to buy this, it should be removed from sale."
1,Stewart is barfable,"Charlize Theron was visually brilliant as the evil queen and Chris Hemsworth was, well, Chris Hemsworth, wonderful visually and acting - the movie could have been about the two of them and been fantastic, but no, they had to have Kristin Stewart play Snow White... correct me if I am wrong, but I don't remember the character being a vacuous twit who appears to want to catch flies with her constantly opened-mouth expressionless face. Gawd, she was awful. It even feels as if the film has been cut to try to eliminate as many scenes with her as possible... they didn't eliminate enough."
1,Same as wearing no deodorant at all!,"I followed the instructions 100% and each time I start smelling within about 3 hours. It says not to use more frequently than every 2 days, well, by then, I would be a total social outcast. I don't understnad why it works for some and does not work well or at all for others. Unfortunately I am in the 'not at all' category. I would not mind the price if it worked but this is ridiculous for only 3 hours of protection. I am going to write to the manufacturer and try to get a better understanding of what is going on with this product."
1,disappointed,"I have to say, I loved When I Was Puerto Rican so much that I bought Almost a Woman before I had even finished the first book. To say I was disappointed by Almost a Woman is an understatement. I was, in fact, shocked that Santiago whom had written the first book of her memoir so beautifully was capable of such medocrity with the second. I am hesitant to read the most recent The Turkish Lover. I don't want my opinion of Santiago, whom I still feel is a beautiful writer, to slip any more than it has because of this book."
1,Not worth the money,"I bought iTrip to use instead of a cassette adaptor in my car. I live in Orlando and could not find a station that was totally clear of music or talk. Every station that I tried, I would get static along with my music. I was better off using the car adaptor through my cassette player. You can not use the wire remote with this product either."
1,Sending it to the scrap heap!,"The wrost printer I have ever used. When trying to print photos, it will only print half of an 8X10 before stopping. On documents of 5 pages or more it will stop after about 3. There is just no guts in this printer. Even though I bought it just 2 months ago, I put it in the trash today, and I am smiling that, at least I will not have to mess with it again."
1,Defective Garbage! Cables do not work!,These cables are defective and poor quality. They do not work at all. Do not buy these cables. We purchased a bulk order and all are defective.
1,How not to make a western!!!!!!,"This is really bad. The acting is so hokey and unconvincing. Madsen does practically nothing and his appearance is almost an after thought. The sound is terrible. Gunshots sound distant as if recorded on a cheap video camera. The special effects, as in dynamite explosions, are so hokey it makes me wonder if they used cartoon animators. This film smells like low,low budget. I can watch almost any crappy film but this was almost too much for me. Its one of the few dvd's that went straight from the dvd player to the trash!"
1,cheap,"it works... but the construction is super cheap. the flap where the glasses go for example, barely closes and only has a little velcro thing int he middle. the edges flop down. :/"
1,Nice Idea But...........,"It is unfortunate that when a great rock piece is taken to Broadway that they unecessarily smooth out the rough edges and sanitise it. The rawness and the sinister quality of the original is lost in a mix of terribly done British accents, more emphasis on the tonality and pronunciation of the words than the content and subtext to have any feeling. This is a rock opera. Why not play it as one? I bought this as mere curiosity and was very disappointed. If you are a Who fan and know this show from it's original form, do not purchase this CD. It will end up being used as a coaster within a day or so as you put on the original recording and hear this masterpiece as it was meant to be."
1,crap,"looks nothing like the picture, which could possibly be wood. what arrived was a wood facsimile with wood grain printed upon it"
1,Great series - poor picture quality... :-((,"The series ist great, but the picture quality is very poor. It looks like a cheap VHS tape...The series was filmed on 35mm, but edited on video. Very stupid...CBS, please make a new master from 35mm (like STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION)...Please make also a blu-ray release (HD) with a new master!"
1,swift kick in the buttocks,"consumers should say NO to split seasons. let paramount learn a lesson so this doesnt turn into seasons that are split even more. of course they have a right to make a buck, but this is over the top. i love the 80's soaps, but you know what? i decided to go for dallas instead.maybe if they made shows nearly as compelling as dynasty nowadays they wouldnt have to ATTEMPT to squeeze every lost dollar out of loyal fans.wait until paramount realizes they have to respect the consumer and then buy it when they re-release them as single seasons. shame on paramount."
1,Doesn't work well,The bulb never gets hot enough to get the lava moving much. I get maybe one blob an hour making it's way to the top. I do like the space ship design.
1,Cheap and crappy,Only used it on a Mac to enable regular headset use. Not impressed. The speaker volume blasts out at max and doesn't want to adjust.
1,not up to par,I've watched all of Dexter and a bit surprised how people think this season is great. I honestly feel it's the worst season so far. Maybe developments here and there are great but the thing about Dexter is the main person who is the killer. Nothing can top Lithgow from season 4 and then also his brother in Season 1. But this killer sequence was not good at all. Nothing shocking at all when there were opportunities to really break new ground.
1,Definitely not up to snuff,"I'm a huge fan of mysteries set in Rome - but this series falls short of the rest. I liked the first couple I read, but was stunned at how the quality fell off as each book arrived. David Wishart can write, but for some reason he rambles endlessly, puts in unnecessary characters - and this from someone who loves lots of eccentric charactes in her mysteries - and generally over does the slangy casualness. I do get what the writer is after, but I don't think he achieves if except fleetingly. I have found the books frustrating, as they are almost good. Which is worse than just plain bad. Well, with the exception of the last book in the series - which was just plain bad. Anyway, check one or two out of the library first - perhaps you have a different viewpoint than I do.For reference - I like John Maddox Roberts, Lindsey Davis, Steven Saylor mysteries of ancient Rome."
1,Doesn't Stand The Test of Time,"OK, I'll admit it. I bought this cassette when it first came out, and I thought it was the coolest thing ever. Although I never went so far as to dress like Adam Ant, I definitely wore this the tape out from repeated play. I listened to it again just recently and realized that, like many things in life, my memories proved better than reality. The album just simply does not stand the test of time. With the exception of ""Stand and Deliver,"" and maybe ""Prince Charming,"" these songs are pretty weak. It's an interesting snapshot of a moment in history, but not one that will be long remembered."
1,"Cheap, but not worth it",This is simply a brief statement from a medical newsletter. It's not detailed enough to be useful either to a physician or to a pregnant woman.
1,Not What I Expected,I was very disappionted with this organizer. The cost of shipping was almost as much as the book itself. It is made very poorly and doesn't hold many coupons at all. The pockets are only made of paper and seem like they are going to break soon.
1,Disappointing!,"Loved it when I got it, and for the week it worked. I was OK with the small size, but really sorry when the lights kept going but the misting stopped. I'd suggest you look elsewhere. I'm going to."
1,More than a little deceptive,"System is absolutely the wrong word to use, as this is only one speaker. Buyer beware!!"
1,Incorrect Information,"Since when did all fish other than the coelacanth and sharks have only one dorsal fin?...in Appendix A under ""Fins and Scales"": ""apart from sharks, all other fish have one dorsal fin only.""What about mullets (Mugilidae), drums (Sciaenidae), darters (Percidae), and a whole host of other fish that have two dorsal fins? Some of them might not be separated by a whole lot of space, but there's definitely two.Could understand if it seemed like a typo, but this just seems to be an exaggeration of how special the coelacanth is. Coelacanths are special just by themselves; they don't need lies to make them seem any more so.It's possible that if I weren't such a fish enthusiast I would've enjoyed this book more."
1,The Worst!,"I'm an elementary school physical education teacher, always on the lookout for good square dance discs. Although I call my own dances to instrumental only discs, occasionally I like to get a disc with calls done for me. This is the WORST square dance disc I've ever heard! The band is bad enough, but Slim calls the dances in the most hideous off key monotone... and he sounds bored doing it to boot! Don't say you weren't warned!"
1,Possible Contamination by Infected Blood,"Due to the fact that certain blood born infections remain virulent despite heat and chemical attempts at disinfection, hospitals now use ALL disposable instruments. Scissors, staple removers, forceps, as well as syringes, scalpels, and sutures are SINGLE USE. Hepatitis C patients are universally counseled to keep razors inaccessable to children and guests. In my opinion, the resale of used razors should not be permitted, as the reuse of contaminated instruments is not permitted."
1,It is all Americas fault,"Read the better german verison frist. Pat sings a song of america and it's duchland, duchland uber allas. The shear refusal to see that the World War One not World War Two bankupted the britsh empire is the basis for this rant and it gets worse. Pat also see to see that was the opinion of the domnions fear full that the chamberlin might sell them out when the japanese moved south that forced a change of policy. Also I am no fan of Mao but Pat again fails to see that it was Mao success in maintaing a fighting force against the japanese from 1937 to 1945 gave him the basis for power not any thing america did. Indeed, Gen. George Marshall spend month in china in 1946 trying to arange for a cease fire and poltical settlement."
1,Read the Description !,"I bought this watch for my husband, but didn't take the time to read the description carefully. So it's my fault I had to send it back. He is in the Army and leaving soon for Iraq. I thought this sturdy watch would be a perfect gift. Unfortunately it does not work if you're more than 2,000 miles from Colorado. If you are not going to leave the continental United States I suppose it would be a good watch."
1,Not impressed.,"Honestly, I really wasn't impressed with this album. The first four songs really caught my attention but the remaining seven didn't impress me at all. I wasn't really thrilled about the first single at first, but it grew on me after a while. There are some great beats overall but the lyrics and vocal production could have been a whole lot better. Cassie is a beautiful girl but she needs to release something creative and unique or else she will get lost in the shuffle."
1,Stupid to make Doc a pitcher in hiding!,"I was really excited to see this movie when I found out that it existed. I love both Cannery Row and Sweet Thursday and spent considerable time and effort into tracking this down. I was not a fan. Doc has no beard, he is much more callous than he was in the book, they turned him into an ex pitcher who hit the seer in the head with a bad pitch and is now in hiding. Also Hazel is borderline developmentally disabled in this film. Maybe see this if you have not read then books but then go and read the books and be amazed."
1,Transform?,I found nothing practical to transform my life in this book. I have had much more success with FREE YOUR MIND by Sensei TonyFree Your Mind: The Four Directions of an Awakened Life
1,Our democracy?,Just a comment about the title of this book. We live in a Constitutional Republic NOT a democracy.
1,Not Win7 Compatible?,"According to the packaging and the Sabrent website, this USB hub is supposed to be compatible with Win7. However, when I attempted to use it with a Win7 laptop, I received an installation error and it will not read from any of the 4 ports. I then tried using it in a computer running XP and it worked fine. I tried another Win7 laptop and has the same issue - installation error, not reading from the ports. I tried using a port on my docking station and was able to get the hub to install. However, still will not read from the ports. I tried all 4 ports and different USB flash drives, but received the same result - the drive appears in the list of drives, but is listed as ""empty."""
1,Buyer Beware,"Just downloaded this and it's fine, but I paid $9.49 for the download version. Amazon offers the same album in an earlier release under the title ""Beatles Blues"" for $6.99Beatles Blues. Same 17 songs, so check out that one before you spend extra money. And I can't find a way to let Amazon know how unhappy I am about this. If you know a way I can ask for a partial refund, I'd love to hear from you."
1,I am ashamed to own this video,"I bought this video in the bargain bin for $2. I now know that I have completed wasted the money and also lost 2 hours from my life by watching it. I'm not surprised that it hasn't be re-released but I'm amazed that it was released in the first place. The acting is poor, the story is incoherent, the action is sloppy and couldn't be more poorly done. I'm sure that any high school drama class with a video camera and a combined IQ of more than 80 could do better. Final advice: Clip your toenails instead of watching this movie, at least it would be more entertaining."
1,one of the WORST animes i've seen!,"SAVE YUR MONEY!!! from the description i thought it sounded like a good story and anime to watch but geez what a waste of money. i have the whole series collection and i had to force myself to keep watching after the first episode in order to give it a fair chance. i kept hoping it would get better but it didnt! i watched 2 and a half episodes and shut it off. the anime isnt that good, the dialogue is horrible, the story is silly but in a dumb/stupid way not in a cute funny way. it comes off as very kiddish and NOt entertaining but i can't even pass it off to my little cousins to watch it because it depicts the female characters in such a how do u say derogatory manner? they show the high school girls wearing the skimpiest hoochiest clothes for no reason... oh what a dissapointment!"
1,A Pretentious Waste Of Time!,"This movie is supposed to be a romantic comedy, loosely based on classical literature, but it is far from funny. In fact, it is very sad to see such a feeble attempt at movie making! It begins with a very long, tedious narration which is supposed to be humorous, but isn't even close. I couldn't wait for the narration to end, but when it did, the dialogue wasn't any better. Everything is uniformly mediocre(that is being generous). Even the acting is lousy, which is surprising, since the cast is quite impressive. but that is what happens when good actors are given a bad script. If you think that the ""R"" rating will at least offer some stimulation, think again. Even that aspect is totally amateurish. The special features are more interesting than the movie, since they are not really scripted, so just watch them and skip the movie. Spend your time and money somewhere else!"
1,Uncomfortable on my Neil Cavuto-like head,"I bought these locally-on sale-retail, and returned them the next day, which was a wise decision for me. The sides of the headphones, even with adjustment (pulling them apart as instructed) were uncomfortable on my Neil Cavuto-like head, especially with my glasses adding to the mix. My ear canal openings also hurt after a short time; tried both earpieces. Tilting my head upward made them even more uncomfortable; not good if I was biking. I will stay wired for now. I'll give them 2 stars only because of the cool look and leap in technology."
1,pillows weren't fluffy enough,Some said that the pillows weren't fluffy enough. I hate to admit it but I have to agree. They seem great at first but the don't really stand up great on their own. I have them propped up against my wall at the head of my bed and I have to really fluff them just so for them to look right. They need to be filled a little more.
1,Railroad tales,This CUDDA BEEN A CONTENDER but the foul language and hokey story left me no choice but to scrap this one. I love railroads and steam locomotives but the Hollywood proclivity to use such foul language leaves me cold.A looser for those who appreciate stories without the foul mouthed charactors who cannot speak without cursing. With the language Guardian on you get to hear about 2/3 of the film because the foulness is stripped. That says it all.Scrap it.
1,Bad buy,"I must have gotten a bad set I'm reasonably certain they forgot to sharpen a couple of them, of the four I found that would cut,one broke and the bit came loose from the ferrule on the other. The last two are sizes I don't use very often."
1,WW2 propaganda,"This documentary was made before the end of WW2 and it shows. It seems made to convinced the audience that their allies of the time (USSR and China) are good, free countries and Nazi Germany is the devil incarnate. For exemple, they go into great details explaining that the USSR is a great democracy and the Stalin is a good ruler. Interesting for seing how can our 'good' western countries can ally itself with an horrible dictator such as Stalin and try to convince its people he's not so bad after all. But that's about it."
1,Average,"I've had two of these and they are simply average. They do the trick but eventually break from wear. If you plan on jumping rope regularly like I do (20-45 mins a session, several times a week) you should get a better rope.A decent rope will not cost much more than 20 dollars (e.g. a Nike rope, which I just reviewed), but will last you for years. I have worn out one of these Everlast ropes in just a few months. The other lasted about a year before breaking. Typically ropes break either near the handle or where it hits the ground - I've had one of each type of failure happen with this rope. The handle does not have a bearing, so the rope isn't as free to rotate. Furthermore, the rope itself is pretty thin and doesn't last much wear.Sometimes ""more is less"" - if you go ahead and just dish out the 20 bucks now, you'll probably end up with a rope that will outlast several of these."
1,Not believable,"I had high hopes for this book as I am in love with Key West and fishing. I was hoping for something along the lines of ""The Old Man and the Sea"". The story was a total disappointment. Although the writer knows how to write, he does not know how to concoct a believable story."
1,BETTY LOU'S A BIG FAT LIAR!,"Shy Betty Lou (Penelope Ann Miller) who rightly thinks of herself as a dull, small town librarian, injects a little excitement into boring life by confessing to a murder her cop husband is investigating in Allan Moyle's comedy, romance, thriller.It all starts when Betty Lou finds a discarded gun, a weapon used in a recent murder, in a park. She dutifully takes it to the police, but she's ignored until she fires it and confesses to the crime. Taken to jail, the mousy librarian is transformed into a bombshell by some of her fellow inmates.Sandra Bullock might consider a remake of this oddball film because it's not the crime that really matters here, it's the change Betty Lou experiences as she takes control of her life. Of course, the loose ends of the story are tied up and Betty Lou even saves her marriage. And it's all triggered (pun intended) by a gun."
1,Close... but Not compatible with 2012 Honda Odyssey EXL,"After much research for a car top carrier for my 2012 Honda Odyssey EXL, I found this product which showed that it would fit. I was excited to give it a try when it arrived. Putting the unit together was relatively easy. Unfortunately, the holes for the brackets did not line up at all on the crossbars of my roof rack (the cross bars do not adjust).This will NOT work for 2012 Honda Odyssey EXL. Even if it did, after seeing how thin the material is on the inside that rubs against the bottom frame, I would be concerned that it would wear through with just a few uses."
1,lied,It said that this was a universal FAIP replacemnet gun and hose. Of course it did not fit m FAIP power washer. Waste of money
1,Painfully Slow,"If I just sit and watch the park, the game runs fine. But if I try to open menus, build roller coasters--basically, do anything that makes the game worth playing--it freezes up for 10 seconds. I played for about two hours, then gave up in frustration."
1,Dissapointed,"I've grown up with prayer plants, how the leaves close at night. The leaves on the green plant have turned yellow and the red leaf plant has turned brown."
1,Please Stay Away!,"As you can tell if you read these reviews, the Roomba works great until the day it doesn't. On that day you are completely out of luck with any servicing. Ours quit operating properly shortly after the one year warranty expired. I would expect to pay for shipping and even pay to have my unit serviced. But all Roomba would do is offer to sell me another one. Why would I buy another unit of something that already broke once and that no one on God's green earth can service. It is a complex machine. So about a hundred different things can go wrong. If you are beyond waranty period forget IRobot company helping you. Their phone support is pitiful and their service department does not exist. Any company that wilfully turns happy customers into unhappy customers everyday will soon be out of business."
1,Horrible ***DON'T BUY***,"I read all the previous reviews of the product and thought that the other naysayers are just mad at the book and the author. I can say that I read and loved the first chapter and was motivated, but it quickly tanked from there. The author's in my opinion are not really ""experts"" and remind me of just some average people out there that are trying to make it big. I didn't really learn anything and I can't apply what they wrote. I would love to return this book. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. I would recommend other books to help you from TRUSTED SOURCES: steve covey, norman vincent peale, etc."
1,nothing new,Seems there is nothing new on this version. Many major new streets and highways that have been open well over a year are not on their maps. I wanted it to upgrade from V2003 but it was a was a waste of money!
1,thimble or lampshade,I ordered a lampshade but got a thimble. You should give measurements when you sell items.I even email a precautionary note which went unanswered because i know that on mail orders thimbles are frequently substituted for lamp shades.
1,Definitely not her best,"This is not one of M. Kleypas' best. Trite plotlines, simplistic writing and shallow characters come across as a first-time author. I had a lot of issues with this story. To name a few. She explains why the characters feel a certain way instead of conveying the emotions through the story. The female lead is ridiculous. The idea that British society at that time would blithely accept a ""Duchess"" - of the highest peerage! - entertaining the lower classes on the stage is too far-fetched. (The cultural responsibilities of a Duchess went far beyond simply being concerned over snide comments about her possible affairs.) The whole idea of them rebelling so strongly against an arranged marriage - no matter their ages - is a bit off mark as well. Arranged marriages were still the norm in the upper aristocracy. there are so many irritants in this book. I was dissapointed. Save your money and go for a different Kleypas - or get Stephanie Laurens' Devil's Bride."
1,Best Picture? Not even close...,"Speaking of Rene Zellweger, that just reminded me that I also recently watched this movie for the first time. Unfortunately, it did nothing for me (and I tend to actually like musicals!). I can't believe this won all those awards (Best Picture???). It looked great, and the acting was good, but I never gathered any sympathy or empathy with any of the characters, and the music itself didn't do much for me either."
1,They can research -but- the Frasers can't write!,"Both Fraser Mother & Fraser daughter can research a subject to death. However, neither writes gracefully or entertainingly. This book reads like a compilation of notes. Yawn. I'd rather read a loosey goosey Mitford biography, as if I wanted sleep, I'd read dissertations."
1,"Please invest in a better pump, this one is a waste of money","I purchased this pump after reading all of the positive reviews. I also figured I would barely ever use it and just had it for a back up. I had such a hard time a first breast feeding, that I figured I would just pump and give my daughter a bottle. This was a better option for me than giving her formula. I almost gave up all together because of this pump. the massaging mechanism causes the pump to loose suction, so I removed that and now the white valve pops out in the middle of pumping. It has just been the biggest headache for me. I fianlly gave up and went out a bought a $300 electric pump and love it. I wish I would of just saved the $50 and bought the electric one from the begining. PLEASE DO ALOT OF RESEARCH BEFORE BUYING A BREAST PUMP. IT WILL MAKE BREAST FEEDING MORE ENJOYABLE THAN A HEADACHE."
1,A whizzer speaker,These speakers have a very small magnet and not much weight to them. They remind me a lot of the old whizzer cone speakers you would get factory in cars. They are tinny and do not play into lower octaves very well. They are very reasonably priced and do make noise but there are a lot better speakers out there.
1,Cheap for a reason...,"I've used different types of minoxidil and this is the only product that increased the number of gray hairs, messed up the texture, and actually seemed to cause further hair loss... That's what I get for buying a knockoff...lol."
1,Bag tear easily and leaked a few times.,"I don't understand how it's hard to make a bag that's1) Easy to tear from each other2) Doesn't leak3) Thick enough to not have to feel the poop.This bag doesn't do any of these, would not recommend them."
1,degree of guilt,This book started out with enough mystery to draw you in. I did like the book but felt the relationship of Teri and her husband was not believable and her relationship with Paget was completely predictable
1,I skipped whole paragraphs,"This book is okay, but often she jumps from current to a past occurence very frequently. One page, referred to something that had happened three different time periods in her life. Sorta rambling. If this hadn't been on Oprah, I never would have started it....."
1,Benetton Sport - Benetton,"the scent does not last long, the lotion did not come with plastic packaging. I wont buy again thi item"
1,Tie Rack,This is a cheap quality tie rack. It looked a lot better in the advertising. It is not worth purchasing or paying for the shipping.
1,pure schlock,"Clarke opens this book stating that he hopes it will, ""cause readers to think."" In reality this book is nothing more than an anti-US diatribe wrapped around fictional schlock. Here the US is the bad guy, and the Arabs are the good guys who only want democracy. Clarke conveniently forgets that every terrorist on 9-11 was Arab. He also ignores the basic structure of US government in composing this fantasy.Clarke must be very bitter after losing his position in the US government where he was the failed National Coordinator for Security and Counter-terrorism. This book is the result of that bitterness. Pure pap."
1,A Misleading Book,"The photos in the book lead you to believe that with a few simple props and some effort an over-50 person of average flexibility can achieve the pretzel postures of Iyengar. I just don't believe it. I started yoga at age 65. I had done high-impact aerobics for 10 years prior and still do. I am quite active. But I will never be able to accomplish the postures that the author probably chose as inspirational. Nevertheless, I have made slow but steady progress (without props) starting with simple postures and moving on to intermediate postures. Yoga is wonderful for strength, flexibility, breathing, and relaxation. I started with ""The American Yoga Association Beginner's Manual"" by Alice Christensen three years ago and I am now ready to move on to an intermediate level."
1,reading literaure superficially,"In her memoir of reading Western classics, Ms. Nafisi reveals a pretty shallow mind. Okay, she has read all of these classics, but she spends so much of her book talking about male professors she does not like and male students she does not respect (because they do not share her feminist views). Why include all of this gossip about strangers? She offers little insight about the books themselves. I went away from this book feeling that the author had a big ego but did not really understand literature. She spends too much time on gimmicks, gossip and cream puffs."
1,Marie Claire,Didn't sign up for auto-renewal and don't want it! Please make it stop!The magazine is a waste of money? OK! I'll repeat do not spend your money
1,Spend a few more extra dollars.,"I bought this keyboard about 6 months ago. I thought it was great. Being able to type with the lights out not disturbing the wife. But after normal everyday use,e-mailing,surfing the web, I noticed that the letters are rubbing off on the keys. Soon there will be nothoing left of the N or the E on this keyboard. Spend a few extra dollars and get the better lighted keyboard. I will be replacing mine shortly."
1,the theme of Terraforming Mars deserves a better author,"I ordered all three of these books,thinking they would be a treat. Alas, I fell asleep over Red Mars, but I finished that one, just because I hoped it would get better. But Green and Blue MArs were to much to endure, boring characters going through improbable adventures and getting immortal in the process; that is if they were not killed in the full scale war between the settlers of Mars and the bad guys from Earth that they author envisaged. Really, it was totally uninspired and to boring to endure!"
1,What is going on at this Website?,"This Book ISBN# 1-877991-35-x ""Lab Experiments for Advanced Placement Chemistry"" by Vonderbrink lists for $24.99 by the Publisher VarsityBooks. What is going on with the inflated pricing? Buyer Beware!"
1,Yngwie's Embarrassment - I'd Give It Zero Stars If I Could,"This is Yngwie's worst CD by far. Everything is bad - songwriting, lyrics, you name it. Yngwie sometimes goes on autopilot, and when he does things like this happen. A serious waste of a serious talent. Very sad.If you want to get some Yngwie try Alcatrazz's No Perole from Rock and Roll, Rising Force, 7th Sign, Facing the Animal, or Concerto."
1,Does not live up to product label,"I received this a few days ago and was eager to try it now that the weather is turn colder. The other day, it was about 40 degrees when I got out and my hands were freezing when I got to my destination 8 miles later. This morning it was drizzling when I went out for a ride. It turned to light rain a few minutes later and my hands were soaking wet. Product advertising says windproof and waterproof but it is neither. Since I already used it, I can't return it anymore - a real bummer! I bought this specifically for the colder and rainy weather that is upon us now. It looks like I'm going to have to buy another one - one that works."
1,Not ready for Wireless,"Installation was very difficult. Printed documents poor. On-line documents not much better. I learned the most from someone's review. A call to the vendor was very helpful. After I finally (6 hours) got it set up, I found that music buffered in mid-song. (Not quite what I was expecting.) My router was less than 20 feet way from the unit on the other side of two sheet rock walls. So I shouldn't have this kind of problem. I returned the unit to Amazon. BTW, Amazon was great - very prompt with the refund."
1,Not so great,Sheets are thin and leave lint balls all over my mattress. You really have to stretch them out to fit on a higher mattress. But you get what you pay for.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS dvd SET!,"Is there such thing as no stars?As the other reviewer stated the remastering of the films is very low quality, if they bothered at all (some of the movies jumped around so much they were unwatchable). The second DVD will not play on our player and the third DVD is a movie called ""Dumber than Dirt"". I guess I was too for shelling out the money I did for these movies. AMC and Genius Entertainment are a big disappointment."
1,c rated series,"Season 6 is no doubt the worst of the six. At season 4 it was already clear that the producers are unable to acquire good acting talent and Sutherland's suffering from nepotism increases with each season. The plot could have been made realistic were it not for Sutherland's invincibility, awful playscript and poor acting performance. The script needs an extreme makeover in terms of vocabulary and whitty lines to prevent viewers like me going braindead having to listen to it.A ""C"" rated series with no depth and a producer and actor that clearly seems full of himself and it."
1,I would have chosen a different one,"The one problem I have with this watch is when you push the button on the side to make the light come on, the time disappears. I thought the purpose for having the light is to check the time when it's dark. Hard to do when the time just vanishes. I would have chose a different watch had I know that. Disappointing purchase."
1,NOT WORTH IT,Love the color but the quality is very thin. Ive had 2 pans fall on the floor and both have huge dents and i receiced 1 pan that was already warped. :(
1,paper damaged,The roll of paper that I recieved had what appeares to be 3 roller marks down the paper. I am trying to get it replaced but Adorama is not willing to help out because the order is more then 14 days old. I was not informed to inspect the product on arrival to insure a 14 day turn aroundf on issues.
1,cool concept needs more work,"I drive a dodge minivan and no matter what I do I can not get the mirror to stay so I can see my little guy. I have tryed shoving jackets, stuffed toys even a empty thing of diamond almonds but nothing works. As soon as I think its adjusted my kid starts kicking and it moves again. More of a headache than any other mirror I have owned. Thankfully I have older kids that can tell me what the baby is doing cuz he really enjoys the toy so I hate to take it away."
1,"ugly! THe idea is good,but a new bron is never cute.",THis cat is so ugly!It looks like a toy that was made in a day. (Thats not a good thing)
1,"Lengthy, boring descriptions about nothing in particular...","Reading ""Morgan's Passing"" is like listening to your maiden aunt drone on about people from her past -- people you don't know, don't care about, and who don't seem to grow on you as their story unfolds. The title itself is like an afterthought, tacked onto the final chapter before the author decides to quit. Anne Tyler has written undisputed classics, but this one lacks her trademark zip and humor. But perhaps even geniuses need to have a break."
1,Denim jeans,"I wasn't at all expecting cargo jeans when I opened the package, which I strongly dislike as does my husband."
1,Reviews were good until I bought it.,"I bought this pedometer when the ratings for it were 5 stars! Now there are all kinds of bad reviews starting in 2007. Too bad I bought it in December. This is a piece of junk. I thought I was ordering a mid-priced pedometer. (It was $12 at that time). I agree about it not staying on, and even though I followed the calibration instructions, the steps were never accurate. I had an additional problem in that parts of the numbers were missing on the LCD most of the time. So is a backwards three actually an eight, was that a one or a seven, is that 5000 or 6000? I never knew. The only time all the lines displayed making perfect numbers was when you cleared it to 0000. I'll probably try a 'cheapy' from Walmart. It will probably do better than this."
1,Enjoy Joe College: Not so much a novel as a series of events,"Perotta's _Election_ and the movie it inspired were fascinating and original. _Joe College_ is, at best, mildly entertaining. The first half of the book brings you ever deeper in the life of Danny, a confused Yale Junior. He is conflicted by the discontinuity of his life in New Haven and that of his family and friends in New Jersey.While the events are interesting, the remainder of the book does not do much to show how Danny grows or matures. Several plot lines are tied up in the conclusion, but one is left with the feeling that the book was simply a list of things that happen to Danny and that there is no underlying theme."
1,A picture book for (some) adults,"Short on text but not on depth, graphic artist Woodleigh Hubbard offers an extremely colorful ego boost. Although the book is quite pleasant, I cannot imagine myself as a child connecting with any bit of it. According to Hubbard, one should hug an elephant if it steps on your bicycle. ""You Forgive"" commands the text, and, obviously it was an accident, as the elephant is shedding a single tear. This seems another of those ""picture books for parents"" we always wish we had a separate shelf for. Buy it if you have the new age parents who need such affirmations. Hopefully the bright, whimsical illustrations will hold the kids' interest because they are good enough, smart enough, and dog-gone it, they deserve it."
1,Pretense,"This book is fairly pretentious in that it makes a lot of noise about changing psychology, and it comes with lots of recommendations, but really it doesn't say much at all. For instance, it calls homosexuality ""sexual behavior"", and never really addresses it. I suspect the author is of the belief that one can ""develop"" beyond it to heterosexuality; I, however, do not believe that. It smacks of the Reagan era, which was way repressed. On the other hand, the book OKs abortion, so political ideology is probably not behind this book.But it just doesn't seem to merit its ""groundbreaking"" subtitle."
1,disappointing,"the whimsical music in the background really detracted from this movie, especially considering the subject matter. that combined with the editing gave it the feeling of a long commercial. it's too bad, because the material was facinating. if the movie was made up of authentic footage, it would have been an incredible documentary."
1,Not useful in the 21st Century School,"This book reads like a budget 101 book. If you have ever managed your own bank account before, there is no need for the book. With the way school finance is managed by business managers, a principal never sees the bank statement or is even able to get close to transferring funds around. This book would only come in handy for a school that does not have a financial system in place."
1,"There ought to be a ""legal"" limit to fantasy!","I have read ""Engines of Creation"". From my knowledge of the design and function of the human body (right down to the sub-nano levels), I have to say that Drexler is ""out of his mind"" on a lot of things he has written in that book. There ought to be a ""legal"" limit to fantasy !"
1,These speakers were awful,"One great system and one awful one.I bought these speakers because I already had a set that works great, no problems at all.but when I got this set it was awful, Right out of the box the Satellite speakers didn't work right. They had very little if any sound. I could feel the bass but I couldn't really get anything out of the satellite speakers. (shame! Maybe that was why the price was so low!!) the first set was really good, now I don't know what to buy,I still need another set of speakers i have really good sound cards in my computers, I'd like to have pretty good speakers. Was it just a fluke? or was the first set a fluke? None the less i sent them back and Amazon gave me a refund with no problem. thanks Amazon."
1,Lots of Flash but lacks Subtlety,"I must have been blown away by a song on late-night radio that features Margolis' soaring voice. But, after several listens, Heart & Soul hasn't lived up to its title - yet. Maybe after a few more listens, because it show promise. Kitty is compared at times to Betty Carter, but Carter is far more imaginable and original. As mentioned, I could change my mind ... some of Live in San Francisco is really good."
1,What a rip off.,"This is a major rip off don't buy from this seller. Its obviously a boot leg. First off it won't even play on my DVD player because it's a boot leg I had to play it on my laptop. Second, it has many edits it's not thye orginal and it looks like someone with a steady hand video taped it while it was palying from VHS. It's homemade. It's not even worth the money. Don't trust this seller. Horrible quality."
1,Z for Zachariah,"This book is extreemly slow and is too imature and is quite a good book for begginers.It has only two characters.It is about a girl left alone in a vally, which has its own wheather, after a terrible nuciar explosion which killed everbody. Untill she meets this guy who is an isane man who wants her to be his slave. He also tries to [physically attack} her."
1,ok but,a bit on the toy side than true cooking items. if not wanting to send a lot on kids cooking set would be ok. but don't expect to last long.
1,"Had no effect on my cat, just my wallet","I really wanted this to work. I used it for 3 months and spent about 40.00. Unfortunately, the product did not help with my cats anxiety separation issues or aggressive behavior. So I still have the same problems and less money."
1,A truly woeful film.,"Hollywood take note, good special effects are no substitute for a quality story and good acting. A truly woeful film that had people in the theatre laughing."
1,Do not rely on this as a guide.,"I have attempted to do more than 100 hikes in this book -- 90% in Oregon. At least 30% of the trails do not exist or the driving directions were so poor you could not find the trailhead -- and some you simply could not get to in a standard vehicle. The descriptions were not accurate. It seems like the author wrote by using maps, not by visiting the trails. I ended up using a few of the pages to start a fire on one of the hikes. That was the best use I got out of the guide.Some information was reasonable."
1,Not only wrong but foolish,"This book is ignorant and badly written. It is a rehashing of tired old fallacies exposed centuries ago. I am not a fundamentalist and indeed only a rather vague Christian, but I know tired rhetoric and fallacious argument when I see it. This book insults the reader's intelligence. Basically the author wants to keep the dignity and prestige of being a Christian bishop while denying and sneering at basic tenets ofChritianity. An outright atheist would be more worthy or respect."
1,"Beginners Level, 20 years out of date","Few, if any, are learning 370 Assembler Language today; those looking for a book on the topic are primarily interested in a reference with substantive examples. This is a very basic manual that does not include instructions that have been around for close to two decades: e.g. CLCL, MVCL. It is misleading for the publisher to indicate it was updated in 1986 when little more than the title was changed."
1,I'd look elsewhere...,"I cannot recommend this bridge at all. I read the negative reviews, rolled the dice, and came up snake eyes. Despite my best efforts, this unit doesn't ""see"" either of my two wireless networks. If you aren't the gambling type, I'd look elsewhere."
1,Slayers Worst Album,"I like Nu-MEtal...But I think bands like slayer should stick to what they do best...Old school sounding thrash/Death Metal.This Record is way to ""Nu"" sounding for a Slayer Release.I dont need to Hear Tom Arya Rap.I know that bands like to try new things,but slayer took it way to far on this CD.This CD is bad for a slayer CD...But I would take a mediocre Slayer CD over alot of other Garbage out there today.This CD does have its gems.""Bitter Peace"" is a great old school sounding song.""desire"" sounds like it could have been on the SOH record.But they are trying way to hard not to sound like a thrash band that was born in the 80's on this CD...If you are buying a Slayer CD for the first time I recomend ""South of HEaven"" or ""Hell Awaits"" buy this one last to fill out your SLAYER collection."
1,Caught on fire,I went to place a DVD in the tray. I pushed the eject button and nothing happened. I pushed it again and waited. then smoke started coming out of the tray area. I wanted people to know so they can be careful. I would personally take it back before something happens. Mine is in the trash. What a waste. It worked fine until then. I read the other reviews and I am not even going to bother calling Sony. I am going to report it to Consumer Report. Be Careful.
1,Yup!,"When I bought this product, it was suppose to be BRAND NEW. I got a USED product, sealed in a crappy package that was pre-opened before me. I'm sorry, did I NOT pay for a brand new product? To further assist my statement, one of dumbbell closers was messed up so it wouldn't go all the way in. When I looked inside of it, it was a messed up, scratched, and in a really bad shape. THIS IS A NEW PRODUCT?You deserve one star. The worst thing I've bought on Amazon, and it surely not Amazon ... whomever I bought this from know who they are. I'll never do business with them ... ever."
1,Returning after 1 day of use,"Very disappointed. Problematic from the beginning. Terrible manual. Stopped halfway through a timed recording session. And worst of all - absolutely would not eject a tape. It took 20 minutes of effort to get the tape out - through a combination of pressing eject, shaking machine and trying to grab at tape before it was sucked back into chamber. Caveat emptor!"
1,This adapter is not stereo!,"The ""3.5mm Stereo Audio Adapter for Nokia"" is actually not a stereo one. I even opened it to see the wiring and saw only two wires inside (ground and signal) instead of three (ground plus left and right signal). I checked and found the other signal contact that is not wired. Do not be mislead by incorrect description. The adapter fits OK (with minor problems, you need to force it a little), but will give you a mono sound."
1,another problem device,"I echo other complaints about the DWL520. The connection is made with very good signal strength and quality. However, the device refuses to make any throughput. It would almost never successfully load a page. The irony is that I am using another Dlink product as the router. The 520 is a poor product."
1,Bad,"Possibly worste movie put together ever. The sound was so hard to hear. The movie was like someone grabbed a home camera and just played pretend. Only reason I watched it was to give it a shot since it had Whitney Mixter in it, the actors did a fine job but whoever put the whole thing together did a really bad job."
1,"BAD CD-CHANGER, GREAT SOUND!","It is all good except for a few things: the fm receptor is in the back of the stereo sytem and must be pulled out all the way to receive it the clearest, the cd changer is extremely slow and makes alot of noise, also when theres no cds in there it searches through each dics holder, it takes alot of time and wastes alot of power. Other than that the sound is great, the look is nice, theres a nice and simple remote, and contains all the features of a stereo system!"
1,Save your money...,"This book was a complete waste of $20. The EOS 7 has so many features, but very few of them are explained in this book any better than the manual. These folks should be embarassed to sell this for the price. I now know why they're sealed in plastic wrap at the bookstore -- to prevent you from actually seeing inside before purchasing... For other cameras I own, I've found the Short Course in Photography series by Dennis Curtin to be great resources. I don't think they have one on the EOS 7 however."
1,another exploitation of fischer s name,"i am very disappointed from this book. Its title seemed to me very promising but nothing matched my expectations. This book contains a lot of chess interviews some interesting some not..But nothing more, it is just a collection of interviews that the author- a known chess journalist- has taken through out his career. Moreover he uses the very marketable name of bobby fischer inspite that only a brief part of the book is refering to him. Save your money for something else...."
1,Medal of Honor: Pacific Assault,"This game is just awful. Extremely long load times, and choppy game play even on the most powerful of PC's. The forced registration took almost 12 hours to complete because EA's servers were down, and I could not play online until I registered. The multiplayer levels are rich in textures, but poor in gameplay. Having been a HUGE fan of Medal of Honor: Allied Assault and Spearhead, I could not be more disappointed by the game. Call of Duty offers a much better multiplayer experience. I don't know what the folks at EA games were thinking, but they have a lemon on their hands with Pacific Assault. Its just a poorly designed game, and I don't think a patch will save this one from being $19.99 in a bargain bin in a few months."
1,Not a chance EA,I was very excited to play this game and have been following it for years. I was on my way to purchase it when I was informed on the DRM issue. I'll just play at my friend's house or not play at all.
1,One of the worst books about laying on of stones I have seen,I bought this book and ended up returning it. I was unimpressed by the quantity of stones used and felt that it was not well written. I have all of Melody's other Love Is In The Earth books and am very impressed by them but this one was not worth the money. I have a few other books that are much better written. Thanks for listening.
1,Over Written,I have read books on mysticism and they are not so wordy with long sentences. She includes flowerly adjectives that are unnecessary. I have heard that people give up reading her books because they are too difficult to understand. I think it's because she really doesn't write well. I can understand what she is saying if I take time to translate it simply. Taking out all the unnecessary words as I am reading it takes time and not worth the read. There are a lot easier and better written books that have the same information.
1,THIS TOY SUCKS,I got this toy for my birthday and no matter what the beans would get stuck in the track. DO NOT BUY THIS TOY!!!! The only reson it has any educational value is that you learn how to tweak it so one mighty bean hits the bottom. The only good thing is you get two racing mighty beanz.
1,Very Short Life,Both bulbs blew out after only 6 months of use. I replaced with standard bulbs at 1/4 the cost. They are brighter than standard but I do not recommend.
1,Do Not buy this clock - nothing good about it,Yes the clock is plastic with silvered coating - which isn't the greatest - the real problem is the part that lights up is about the circumference of a quarter in the middle of the clock face. Try telling time in the middle of the night when you can't tell the hour hand from the minute hand. And who the heck needs a second hand on a bedside clock? Also the second hand makes a faint ticking noise. Keep looking...
1,underwhelmed,"even as a beginner yoga student, i barely found use for most of this kit. i thought id get started with something inexpensive and better than my floor rug. i was wrong, a waste of money. the matt and bag and straps were all flimsy, made of lame material. the only use ive gotten from this kit is the blocks, which work perfectly. go with another kit"
1,Save your little Bob fan a truckload of aggravation,"My 2 1/2 year old son is a big Bob fan, and when I first heard about the 'click bricks' idea, I thought it would be great for toddlers and preschoolers. Not so. Only certain areas of each brick are magnetic, and they don't fit together in any intuitive way. It's impossible to build the structures you see on the box using the magnetic points as anchors, so basically you're just piling plastic bricks on top of each other that will fall over at the slightest touch. That makes it pretty frustrating for a toddler who wants to do something as simple as opening a door so Bob or Wendy can go into a building. This toy was a big disappointment. On the bright side, he can play with the Bob and Wendy figures in our Fisher Price house, and we've been building Duplo houses for them. Unless you want to deal with a frustrated and disappointed toddler, I'd recommend avoiding these sets!"
1,Twisty? or predictable?,"When Unbreakable first came out, everyone was talking about the twist ending. I think it was Entertainment Weekly that said the mere mention of a twist ending ruined the ending altogether. I would have to agree. From the moment I started watching the movie I began to speculate about the end. When one thinks about it for a while it was easy to figure out. Maybe it wasn't as good as the Sixth Sense (which the ending was ruined for me) but I didn't really like the Sixth Sense as much as the rest of the world did anyway. So it was really a let down but we'll see what happens with this summer's Signs, maybe, hopefully, it will be better."
1,What movie did i see?,"Once there was a wonderful movie named Shag that had really great music. I wish i could find the soundtrack for that one. This must be the soundtrack to some other, not-as-cool movie."
1,"Jar Jar Binks, me thinks you stink!","The only way the next Star Wars Movie (""Attack of the Clones""... maybe because the title ""Attack of the 50 Foot Woman"" was taken?) can be any good is if Jar Jar Binks gets sucked into an X-Wing engine and shreaded into a fine mist! Lucas left out the one thing that made Star Wars great, gritty realism. The characters are too sweet, the ships to clean, and the plot too thin! Darth Maul was wasted... and so was my $$!"
1,Narrative with big holes,"I liked his use of the soldier's point of view. But, all in all, a big disappointment. He didn't make good use of the maps to tell the story. For that matter, there should have been more maps.The unpardonable thing was the way he treated what happened on the British and Canadian beaches, all of which got a couple of small chapters at the end. It was almost as if saying, oh, by the way, there were some Brits around who landed on a couple of beaches."
1,Improper packing results in 4 broken glasses,"When the first shipment arrived one could tell by the sound of tinkling glass that there was broken glass in package. In fact, two of the four glasses were smashed. This was due to a almost total lack of packaging material. I notified amazon and shipped the order back.A second order arrived in the same condition as the first, that is, with two broken glasses.I have shipped those back and asked for a refund."
1,"""Get Dumb"" is more like it","I cannot believe how inane this direct-to-video spin-off to 2008's ""Get Smart"" movie is. It's not exactly a sequel - the events in this happen concurrently with the events in the theatrical film, involving the minor characters featured in the film.Without giving too much away, the ""plot"" involves Bruce and Lloyd's invisibility cloak, its theft and attempts at its retrieval. The only thing this film has going for it are the cameos by most of Get Smart's cast, including one of the leads. Other than that, it's rather predictable, uninteresting, and simply not funny, despite two otherwise talented actors in the lead roles.Thankfully, this disaster runs just over an hour. But that's 71 minutes of my life I'm never getting back. As a fan of the original series (including the Fox update, Get Smart Again and even The Nude Bomb), I was rather disappointed by the 2008 theatrical film, but am really disgusted by this blatant attempt to cash in on summer movie fever."
1,x-men in disguise,"This is a silly poorly written book. Nothing bugs me more than sloppy writing and this book has it in spades. Hooper jumps from character to character with little transition. You are unable to grab hold of the story because it never sits still long enough for you the reader to enjoy it. This is totally a comic book novel. I felt like I was watching an x-men movie instead of reading a book. I even started to find myself envisioning characters in the story upon the appearances of characters like the old star trek guy and wolverine. I couldn't stop thinking of them that way.Their is no real redeeming quality to this book. I made the mistake perhaps of making this my first Hooper story. If there was some sort of character development in this series, it definitely did not occur in this story.STAY AWAY FROM THIS BOOK."
1,"If you haven't bought one yet, DON'T!","I just bought one of these a week ago as my litter robot is being repaired. This cat box is a terrible waste of money, and a terrible design. The rake piles up litter behind itself so it it unable to completely retract, then the cat goes behind it and you have to take the whole thing apart to clean that waste out. It is terrible at controlling odors. The rake doesn't remove waste clumps neatly so there are lots of bits and pieces left in the box. Cleaning out the waste tray is difficult. The tray is tiny so you have to clean it every day. You have to buy special bags for it (Litter Robot, which is a FAR superior product in every single way) uses regular (cheap) garbage bags.I had to shut the whole stupid thing down this weekend, take out the rake and just use it as a regular litter box which I scoop manually. I plan to bring this back to Petco and request a refund. Otherwise what I have here is a $250 plastic box. Save your $250! Do not buy this!"
1,Don't Buy This Product!,It's a shame that you have to buy a product and get it home to know that it doesn't work. Then when you return it you have to pay for shipping and only get 50% back because you opened it. This product is awful.I went through all the voice recognition training and it still made so many mistakes. Then it started to repeat what I said. Plus to add insult to injury the headphones are uncomfortable. If you have VISTA the speech recognition program works better than this - and that's free. I know there are many here who gave rave reviews. That's why I bought this software. But it sure didn't work for me. Two thumbs WAY DOWN!
1,"Handy, but not durable. 2nd starter broken already","It's a great piece of equipment... when not broken. As noted by another reviewer, the pull start gears are plastic. This is the dumbest design I can think of, it's bound to fail. Dig a few holes adn start a few times, the gears wear - or break. Worn and start slipping. Broken, won't catch at all. Either way, it's not designed for longevity. The first time I returned it, I had to debate to get it exchanged. Now I haven't used it much - but has been too long since purchase to return. so I have to find a replacement set of starter gears? Bogus!! Good product with a crappy design on a very critical part. I'd love the thing if I wasn't on 2nd broken one. As it stands, I'm very disappointed."
1,This is NOT a documentary,"I REALLY wanted to like this series. In the end it just really fizzled out. Some of the cinematics were pleasing but use of the same CG segments, over and over and over through multiple episodes and documentary facts (and not so factual information) being provided by celebrities instead of historians was downright painful to watch. This series should never be shown again."
1,You Dopes!,"I would love to rate this book. However, I am still waiting for the copy to arrive. Perhaps, you'll ask me to review it after I'm able to read it. Just a thought....."
1,The Righteous Revenge Of Artemis Bonner,"Personally, I think that this book is a bit scary for people who get scared very easily and are under 12. Anyway, I found this book quite interesting, the way it is written. This book takes place in 1880 in a old town around the Alaskan Territory. The things they mention may be frightning - like the was Lucy Feather dip ripping off Artemis's ear with her mouth, while she is hanging upside down.The story they includes some eveidence if how it was baak then in the 1800's, like having very cheap things like accomodation. The way they spoke is also different like: ""Where are you headed?"" Instead of "" Where are you heading?"".You should read this book if you are interested in all the things I have mentioned.Thank you!Celia:)"
1,Memorex printable DVDs,"I have been a user of Memorex discs for several years without a complaint. I don't know why, but these discs are terrible. The printable surface has a streak half an inch wide that isn't readily visible to the naked eye until close inspection reveals it. This streak causes the picture print to develop with a terrible looking streak when printed. This caused me to waste 7 disc worth of ink as well as the burning time. The container that the disc come in is not the same wrapper as I have received in the past, this one is mostly white."
1,"We sucked in metal, now we'll suck at screamo","It is just funny that Papa Roach decided to leave the nu metal scene and become some type of pop punk emo but they can't leave behind their history of a now forgotten skills ( like they had any). Amazingly the musicianship went down from their last album, boring guitars, bleh drumming and bass? Jacoby Dickens or whatever he decided to change his name now decided to drop the rap ability and decided to sing melodically, problem is, he is a terrible singer. The songs mainly comply about problems about relationships that failed and his got old quick, my daddy did not show me enough love tyranny. This album got old quick, basically new style thet did not suit them and only exposed them as a one hit wonder of a corny suicide song.My advice is you people pick up Beneath the Remains by Sepultura, now thats a classic album."
1,"not really boring, just silly","Oh my god. Really, don't get me wrong, i'm an avid Stephen King reader and like most of his work; i think he's very good at seeing the horrific and supernatural in the everyday normality, this book however, is far from his best work.It started out very good, it wasn't boring, although King tended to describe absolutely every (and i mean every) detail of the main character's daily life. We witness his imsomnia an his strange visions; so far so good, im an imsomniac myself and found Ralph's ordeal very interesting. Then it gets ugly. The explanation for Ralph's situation is farfetched and laughable, and has to do with an incredibly trite side plot where he now has to take part. Such a ridiculuos plot twist is a real downer after sucha good start and rising action.I have to advise both, the casual and the avid Stephen King reader to stay clear of this book."
1,Nice looking but not practical,"The product looks great and is nice and heavy, but the angle it leaves the shower head is really bad. The shower head points almost straight down so you can only tilt the shower head so far up. You need to stand really close to the wall in order to use this."
1,Unpleasant,"It's a bit difficult to describe how unpleasant this book is - it's choppy and hard to follow, rather than cute, and mostly the multiple ""adventures"" are irritating. The writing is slap-dash, moralistic, and shallow, and the characters are like a cheap rewrite of Maupin with sexual acts thrown in. Not recommended."
1,Put the face back on... actually never take it off,"This movie has a great premise. Take the face of your enemy and become him to destory him. But I promise you, if you have any intelligence what so ever you will realize that this the dumbest idea ever. At least whoever the hell wrote the movie, tried to make sense out of it, tried to make sense out of cutting your d*mn face off. But the whole thing could have been avoided if they had just beat the crap outta who they needed to get the info from. Nick Cage and John Travolta have no where near the same body. How'd they change that? Yeah, John lost weight but how'd Nick gain weight? You'd have to smoking rocks in order to believe they could pull this movie off, and then smoke more rocks to think that someone could be talked into having their face cut OFF. If you buy this movie, you should also buy some Enron stock and book your flight for Iraq for that mid-summer vacation. Trust me and keep your face on."
1,Cute but small,"The spice rack is nice looking (except for a small chip on the side) and was easy to hang, but unfortunately the space between the shelves is quite small and I can only fit small to medium bottles in it. I still have no place to put larger bottles of spices!"
1,Fooled!,"I bought this book based on the description found on a book club's web page - which mentioned nothing about a ""Flooded Earth Scenario"". So, the book arrives, and it turns out that ARK is nothing more than another ""out there"" propaganda piece churned out from one of the graduates of the ""Al Gore Institute for the Literary Insane""."
1,Just another disapointing racing game.,"I knew I was in trouble when Jak states, near the beginning of the game, ""One thing I can do is race!"".And that's what JAK III is - race after race after race. Want to proceed in the game? You have to race. Want to proceed in the game after that? Another race. So on and so on and so on and so on.Normally I wouldn't mind so much, but with JAK II you MUST complete racing games in order to progress with the rest of the game. Thus, if you cannot finish the racing game you CAN NOT continue with rest of the game.I'm glad I rented this one instead of buying it. If you don't like racing games, don't bother with JAK 3."
1,"Great to watch Lange and Nicholson, but, the film was lame","Jessica Lange and Jack Nicholson are worth the watch..heck, i would watch a toothpaste commercial if they were in it. But this film is just not good. Bad writing, and the ending was a bit ridiculous. But, as i said, if you are a fan of these actors, it's interesting to see film."
1,I thought Snapcase was a hardcore band,"Snapcase went mainstream with this album, no more hardcore. If you are a hardcore listener, don't bother wasting your time."
1,"Not for ""professionals""","While I had an idea this title was for beginners, the name of the book makes other implications ""...for Web Professionals"". This title is not for ""Web Professionals""...at least not as I know the term. This is strictly a beginner book that provides precious little and often times less (when it comes to ActionScript and similar powerful new capabilities) than the manual offers. The ""professional"" portion of the title for the book is inapporpriate for the content."
1,WTH,"Worst movie ever. Horrible, had absolutely nothing to offer. I feel like poking my eyes out. I don't understand how people can go on acting like they enjoyed this. I don't even understand how any of these actors decided to take part in this movie. The script was probably no longer than 5 pages."
1,"My Little Pony Bicycle Seat Cover, Streamer, Bell, and Bar Pad Fun Pack","My order did not include the Bicycle seat cover, which was the whole reason I ordered the product. When I called to find out what the problem was, I was told that the bicycle cover was no longer available and that I could either return the product without paying shipping or get a partial credit. I feel that the product name should not include the bicycle cover, since it is no longer included in this package."
1,Bad Movie,The only good thing about this movie was the guy taking a shower. But even that wasn't that hot because he was showering in his underwear. Who does that?
1,Excellent source material,"Mr. Bruce's contribution to self-aggrandizement turns out to be an excellent resource for both my Advanced Fiction Composition course and my Contemporary Editorial Practices course. In the AFC course, I have my students (when they can stop laughing) rewrite the story. Unlike Mr. Bruce's original, the rewrites must be either interesting or fluent. In my CEP course, I use chapters from the 'novel' as the course final examination. The text is a real curve-breaker though--it is not possible to find 100% of the errors. Truly a tour de force of grammatical incompetence. Encore! Encore!"
1,Not fresh,"I bought the strawberry shortcake flavor and would not recommend buying it from Amazon. The top layer of strawberry flavor is ok, but there's only a little hint of strawberry. The 'cake' part is just nasty (unfortunately that's 80% of the bar). The only description I have for it is inedible. The package I received has an expiration date of Sept 2011 so technically it should be fresh. But there is no way these bars are suppose to taste like this. No would ever buy them. I'm going to get some from the local store to see. But I think Amazon must have stored these in really improper conditions. I find a lot of food products from Amazon are not fresh, despite the expiration date, due to storage. Tried a few bars to make sure it wasn't just one bad apple, and tossed it all in the trash."
1,A Barbra Fan- but this one's a stinker,"I am truly a fan- but I recently listened to an old cassette of this album and struggled to get through it. Except for a few tracks (On My Way to You and All I Ask of You), this album is embarrassing. It has not aged well and ranks, in my mind, as one of Barbra's worst efforts. I actually threw the tape away- a first for me!"
1,Didn't We Already Read This?,"I am a dedicated Stephen King fan, and I will continue to read his works even after reading this lackluster, disappointment of a novel. Despite my love for King's work, I found this book to be a giant letdown. Just as everyone says about this book, it IS a lousy combination of many great King novels. It's X-Files meets It meets Tommyknockers, without any of the excitement. I had to give it 2 stars, because King writes well as usual, but the plot and the actual story stink. I found myself not caring if the characters lived or died, and instead, simply hoping that the book would end soon. Unless you're a dedicated fan, don't waste your time with this, the worst novel in the King catalog."
1,leak in the seam,"The design has numerous pockets and in one of those pockets, the seam gave away and a fully blown bed leaks all its air in 1 hour. Its not like we punctured it or something.Only last 2 weeks. POS.Our cheap Walmart bag lasted for years. Thought I was upgrading.Took it to our local 'authorized seller' for a replacement and we were turned away. The owner couldn't be bothered with these beds since they get so many complaints. He wanted me to ship it directly to them. That will cost more than the bed!So, in addition to have a malfunctioning product, we cannot claim the warranty coz the local authorized store refused to accept the return."
1,LWOODPA,"THE PRODUCT IS NOT WORTH BUYING, IF YOU HAVE A DVD OR CDR DRIVEWITH WIN XP IT WILL NOT WORK MOST OF THE TIME OR AT ALL YOU MUST PUT THE CD IN TO DO ANTHING WITH THE PROGRAM. GARMIN PROGRAM SEEMS TO WORK WITH EASE, CHECK IT OUT BEFORE YOU BUY A MAGELLAN. GARMIN IS MUCH EASIER TO WORK WITH. MAGELLAN TECH, SERICE IS VERY POOR THEY DON'T SEEM TO TRY TO FIX THEIR PROBLEMS THEY HAVE WITH THEIR SOFTWARE, THEY JUST TRY TO SHIFT THE BLAME TO YOU, EVEN THOUGH THEY KNOW THE PROBLEM IS THEIRS."
1,PIRATE DVD,"This is a pirate release of the video ""Amália Rodrigues, Live in New York City"". If you like to buy this video I recommend that you purchase the VHS version distributed in the US by Kultur-Whitestar and in Europe by EMI Music or wait for the actual legal US DVD release.Bruno de AlmeidaProducer-Director"
1,Read the Book!,"If this movie worked for you, that's great! It was a real disappointment to me although I love Elijah Wood's acting skills, and think Richard Cormier's books are fantastic to read.Something was amiss with this movie - the acting other than that of Elijah Wood, Janeane Garofalo, and the young boy in the wheelchair, was stilted - they sounded as though they were reading, not acting. The adaptation from the book by the same name left out a lot, and the actors weren't able to relay that message very well.It may be an OK movie if you haven't read the book - but don't watch it without reading the book, first!"
1,The Ps2 version is 10 000 times better,I dont understand why everyone says this is the best game. I recommend that whoever considers buying it rent it first to c how overated this game really is. If u have played the Ps2 version of THP3 u will be extremely dissapointed. The disadvantages to this game is mainly that the useless graphics the extremely hard controls and the impossible missions added to the terrible view u are forced to play from make this game on the bottom of my GBA favourites list.
1,very poor quality,1)wig did not fit an adult male head2)there were no sideburns as pictured3)the hair was falling out of the wig4)I was charged a 20% re-stocking fee for something that SHOULD NOT be restocked
1,Not very nice,I would give this item a zero-stars. I've kept it packaged all this while (having purchased it in Nov 2011 with the black friday deals) and only now got into a stable housing situation. So I went to unpack it this morning and found the actual wall-plug is missing! The power cord! Am trying to figure out how to get one for it. Very frustrating to pay $154 for this item and not being able to use it.
1,Disappontied,"I received the DVD in good Time. The DVD did not play in any of my DVD players. My PC saw the disk as a data disk but was unable to open the files. The sellers web site said I had to fill out a Return Authorization form and send it back with the defective disk. I have to pay return shipping. The process is too complicated for me, it would be better if I were able to speak to a coustomer service rep. So all in all I paid for a lesson in buyer beware"
1,Avoid this product...,"Seriously, when I order something I don't expect to get something different vs. what I ordered or what is pictured on the box. Someone pulled the mailbox out and put a two piece model in. The entire point of ordering this is I wanted a one piece mailbox.The plastic if scratched and faded. Thanks for sending a used, scratched mailbox that does match what I ordered.Then someone puts an inspected label on the box. I waited over a week for this. I would avoid doing business with this outfit...."
1,Unhappy with the time lasted,"This thng didn't even last a WEEK! Only for the first 2 days it managed to charge it. Then the next day, i would stop charging, but remain like a wired control. The next day, it stopped working all together. I might have had a faulty one, but still, that was a total piece of trash!"
1,Not as good as Canon,"I bought the Nikon Coolpix S9 as a replacement for my Canon PowerShot S410 because I wanted a lighter, less bulky ultra-compact camera with good picture quality. The S9 was the one of the lightest, and earlier versions of the Coolpix family received decent reviews.While the camera is light and fits nicely in my pocket, I must say I was not pleased with the quality of the photos I took with the Nikon Coolpix S9. Most photos taken with flash in dark rooms came out blurry and washed out white, and often had lens flare. And photos taken with flash off did not come out as clear as they did with the Canon S410. Photos in normal lighting with flash on came out okay, but still did not match the quality of the Canon.I'm returning the Nikon Coolpix to Amazon today and purchasing a Canon."
1,WARNING this game cannot be won,"because of a SERIOUS BUG in the second mission. Here goes, I'm in the installation that I am trying to save from demo, killed almost everyone, but one demolitionist with and AK-47 trying to escape, I've tried over 20 times to kill this guy, single shot, tri-shot, full auto machine gun, sniper, heck even a grenade launched at him and hitting him in his HEAD, and he will NOT DIE!!! I have grown weary with chasing him unloading ALL of my clips into him. I have also grown weary with the freeze-ups, the reboots of my comp, the idiocy of platoon mates, the ace markmanship of the bad-guys on recruit level, the horrid marksmanship of my guys on recruit. Save your money this game needs some serious debugging"
1,Cannot condone this sort of animal abuse,"I simply cannot condone the decapitation of animals for the purpose of selling t-shirts that attract stunningly attractive, amorous women. These poor animals were sacrificed in the name of mysogyny and I strongly urge all daughters of Lillith, PETA and Grizzly Mammas alike to unite, stand up and declare ""We're not gonna take this! No, we aint gonna take it!"""
1,Aborted the purchase--not as described.,"I accepted an offer of the Pentagon Papers, a four volume set written by the Defense Dept. and published in 1971. The offer stated ""four volumes"". I had earlier purchased the above title from Amazon only to receive one volume, so I contacted the seller to insure this offer was for FOUR volumes. Seller said ""oops-it is only one volume"",. so I canceled the order. It appears that sellers do not really look at the wording of their offers, and Amazon does not check them. Oder at your peril."
1,No go,"I've had no success with the whole biolean system and in fact felt it made me ill, anxious and gave me headaches."
1,Re-recordings! Beware!,"I thought we were finally getting a comprehensive greatest hits album from Brook Benton, but what SHOULD have been his original Mercury recordings are lame remakes. Instead of becoming a part of my music collection, this CD will go in our next garage sale. It is a rip-off!"
1,Lights Back On,"I loved Lights Out 1 and 2, but 3 was a huge disappointment, even after a few listens. Disc 1 begins with a robotechno caucophony that's just straight up weird, painful to listen to, and runs far too long. The rest of Disc 1 gets better, but it still left me waiting for some climactic crescendos or wild mixing twists. CD2 begins with an equally banal sound, and doesn't get interesting until about halfway through. (In fact, the last half of CD2 is the only part of this set that I ever listen to at all anymore.) Overall, the song choice is pretty blah, and even the mixing seems a bit sloppy and uninspired. It's definitely got Lawler's dark and nasty fingerprints throughout, but it sounds a bit canned, and definitely doesn't meet the standard set by 1 and 2."
1,It's no good,"I saw all the great comments and bought one. The picture is not nearly as clear as the one I have. Besides, I try to clip it to my flat monitor and it won't stay. The stand looks very fragile and won't work for me at all. I won't recommend this product."
1,Low grade product,"I have had terrible luck with my entire Malibu system. These lights are made mostly of plastic, break easily, and are a general pain."
1,"New Mom Says ""Thumbs Down""","I am really disappointed with this book. It's packed full of broadly presented and common-sense information. Most of the advice the book recommends will come very natural to you. I've read 150 pages so far and haven't really learned anything. It's also divided by subject, not age, which results in the book approaching subjects very broadly. It often gives the same advice for 1 and 3 year-olds, and anyone who has ever been around these ages understands that this is not practical. A 1 year-old is barely off the bottle, can't communicate well, isn't potty-trained, and is barely learning to hold a spoon! Instead, I recommend other book, which offers a month-by-month guide -""What to Expect the Toddler Years"" for more detailed info on illnesses, developmental milestones, nutrititional guidance, etc."
1,Does not qualify to be called an ergonomic keyboard,"The arrow keys are way too small and have non-standard placement. The function keys and the home, end, pageup, pagedown keys are also much smaller. I find it extremely difficult to use these keys. Of course, the split keys are OK. Personally, my opinion is, if this keyboard makes any operation more difficult than my regular keyboard, then it doesn't qualify as an ergonomic keyboard. I don't see any point in spending more money to end up with a degraded experience."
1,What a dissappointment!,"The game itself is fantastic. Very enjoyable when you find a server without hackers. I ordered the game used expecting an awesome deal. It arrived on time, but without the product code! Why would anyone sell a PC game without a product key? I can't even use the game without Steam! All I wanted to do is play some Counter Strike, but I can't, thanks to the irresponsible ways of the seller. Thanks a lot! Now they have my money and I have something useless. Just fantastic. Don't be fooled by the cheap prices that people are selling this game used for. Copies without product keys are useless. Spend $20 on a new copy."
1,waste of money,this is a waste of your money and time to even think about buying this scale. It looks great but very inaccurate and now it gave me an error 2 and I follow the instruction of taking out the battery.....after that it gave me an error 0 with no solution.
1,Cable plugs did not fit,"Cable male TOSlink plugs to large to fit into female TOSlink connections. I don't think, ""If it doesn't fit FORCE IT"" applied in this case. Returning item for a replacement."
1,DO NOT BUY,"I agree with some of the buyers. This item is a waste of money. I dropped it on my rug, went to pick it up and it was all dirty. I would love to return it but unfortunatley I can't."
1,What a joke.,"I was looking for money management strategies and a book on how to get out of debt. What I got was ranting and raving and instructions to walk around saying ""I am a millionaire!"" This book was disappointing and filled with the name-it-and-claim it philosophy. This book will do more harm than good because it instructs readers to pray for their debts to be miraculously cancelled. The author is way too hung up on fancy clothes, expensive cars and the trappings of prosperity. There are books on the subject of money management and getting out of debt that are practical and life changing. This is not one of them."
1,A short lived piece of garbage.,Does not last long. I bought few of these and gave up on them finally.
1,It left my face with no skin - burned it!,"I used this product once before and it didn't quite do the job, it left hair behind on my upper lip, so last night I decided to leave it on a little longer, 6 minutes to be exact, and I washed my face with cold water and a wet cotton ball to gently go over it so that it would get all the hairs, well, it got all the hairs and then some, my skin!! Today I am all scarred up! =( I used it on the sides of my face, tiny little fuzzy hair. I'm so bummed out and upset!"
1,bending screen broke as soon as I bent it to assemble,"I was so excited to see the UPS man drive up with package- as soon as I found this listed as an easier and cleaner way to handle my litter box, I just had to have- arrived very soon, just opened package, follow instructions and all that was needed was to bend screen, snap securely in place and put cover on- screen bend snapped into 2 pieces as soon as I bent it as directed. I am so angry right now I do not even know how to express my thoughts. I do not drive which is why I ordered this online, to open, have product break, follow these stupid return instructions, be available for the pick up and have to wait further for my ""convenience"" of having a cleaner more sanitary litter box. I am disappointed in the box and Amazon and question my future shopping with them.Extremely unhappy customer-Amy Beth Carducci"
1,Tiny!,This item is only about half the size that it is shown in the listing photo. It also feels very cheaply made.
1,A Piece of [Junk].,Why oh why did I buy this instead of a new Palm? My old Palm worked perfectly. I've had my Visor less than a day and had to perform a dozen resets because it keeps getting fatal errors. Every time I sync - fatal error. My Palm worked so well. This is a stupid piece of junk. I'm returning mine.
1,Such a diappointment,"I rarely give bad reviews, please check out my others for verification. This one is different because HP has scrimped on quality to save a buck and ruined a great product. I've owned: 2, HP 19BII; 1, 12b; 2, 10b; 1 10bII. The new 10bII has damaged my opinion of HP substantially. I have also owned 2 Texas Instruments BAII Plus. (The CFA Institute has made changes over time). I'm much more comfortable with HP than TI, but the HP 10bII is a faint shadow of the 10b and is of VERY low build quality. My ""5"" key requires significant pressure to register. In fact, the 10bII is a flimsy piece of junk."
1,Hacker's Challenge,Complicated. Misleading. Not at all what I expected! Over-priced and very rudimentary. Not worth the hard earned dollars that I shelled out for the book.
1,Not for off the air antenna,"I purchased this hoping it would increase the off the air signal going to my HGTV. To make a long story short, it did nothing to improve the signal coming off the antenna."
1,"Looks nice, but no room...","I bought this bag when our first diaper bag started to tear. It looked big in the store, and the colors are not too loud. I got it home and started packing a day's worth of diapers, change of clothes and a few toys into it, and there was no room. It is great there are three bags, but unless you want to carry three bags around seperatly, they just do not hold very much. You could use it for running errands, but not for a babysitter if your child is going to be there longer than 3 hours. I will be returning and getting the Baby Innovations large bag."
1,Nothing good about it!!!,"My daughter is 7 months old and cries everytime I put her in this seat. With my son we had a fully lined (this one is hard and uncomfortable) soft highchair, easy to recline (this is not). I would just suggest getting a high chair, the space factor was an isshue this time, but honestly when you place this chair on a regular seat you have just as much space taken up. The tray still sticks out pretty far, it is hard for us to slide the chair up to the table because of how low it is. I am very unhappy with this product, and I would not recommend it to anyone!"
1,Construction,"Does this book cover Architectural Drafting and Blue print reading, or is if mostly for mechanical drafting and print reading?"
1,Poor Quality,We were amazed at the poor quality of the DVD. I think the 25th anniversary edition is supposed to have a better quality that doesn't look like they taped it off an old VHS.
1,Crap vacuum,"I bought this vacuum about 2-3 years ago and at first I was very impressed with the suction. But gradually and starting about 6 months after purchase, it began losing suction. The vacuum spins dust and particles through its brushes and out the back on to your feet. I cleaned the filter religiously which is quite challenging since the filter can't just be dusted,it has to be washed and dried completely before further use.Yet, the vacuum became close to useless and I have used it in conjunction with the broom for the last year or so. Well maybe 2-3 yrs is about the life span of a vacuum because I was just using it and it just stopped,dead..completely not working. Trust me..spend the extra and get a good vacuum. I am getting a Dyson next."
1,The Dumbing of the Dead,"I'm begrudgingly giving this 2 stars out of respect for George Romero in much the same way the Academy of Motion Picture & Sciences doles out the occasional Academy Award based on someone's body of work rather than what they've actually been nominated for that year. I can only hope that if Romero is going to do another zombie movie, the next one isn't as laborious, and dare I say, stupid. He seems to be lowering the bar on the zombie genre, a bar that he set rather high with Night of the Living Dead and Dawn of the Dead. Sadly, that bar has been creeping downward ever since, and watching this movie, one wonders how much lower can Romero's bar go? That said, if he were to make another, I'll be there even if others around him continue to raise the genre to new heights."
1,Lost Faith In Mountain Goats,"-I respect musicianship and this album deserves 5 stars, 0 is representaive of my feeling for this album-I feel saddened because the Mountain Goats have lost their charm to me. The majority of listeners in the music-world like production, but I hear them as lacking the rawness of their early albums. Production is the ultimate enemy to music in my opinion, which I accept is the antithesis of most peoples' view. I miss when it sounded like a guitar recorded in a boombox. All Hail West Texas was so revalent and sweet-hearted. There was a detachment from the self-concious sound, which is the epitome of independent music. Everyone progresses, but I appreciate a regression towards simplicity. A ballad with just a guitar proved to be something something outstanding because it was a refreshing break from music coated for the masses. The Mountain Goats have moved into a direction I cannot bring myself to support, but I respect their movement nonetheless."
1,Not worth the money,"It's loud. No timer. The toaster barely toasts, I have to toast twice to get ""toast"". Definitely not worth the money."
1,Pretty cameron diaz doesn't save the film,"A number of times, when I rented a video, I saw the ad for this movie. I was looking forward to see it all because it looked like it would be one long sad & sorry joke. Alas, there is no scenario, the acting is appaling and all the gags are present in the preview! what a waste of time and effort..."
1,stupid cheap boring...,this is the most retarded game since.....well i cant think of a game this dumb the graphics are good but thats about it if anyone can stand to play this game for more then ten minutes i will take back all these things ive said in this review but it truly sucks ass save yourself some money and dont even bother renting it
1,Nope,This was borderline from a recommendation but in the end this movie was just not cutting it. The acting was ok and the story was ok but it just did not deliver that captivating presentation.
1,Piece of Junk,"The unit quit working after only one year. It's had a good life & good location and there is no good reason for it to break. Consider another brand so this does not happen to you.A 2nd issue, if you're still considering purchasing this product is the poor ergonomics on the remote control. It's too easy to press the ""next scene"" button when you're trying to fast forward. Not a great design."
1,too short and too easy,"Whereas the original dark forces and subsequent games focused on puzzles within the missions, jedi academy was more concerned with fighting with light sabres. There was almost no use for conventional weapons, the lightsabre wielding adversaries were easily defeated just by pushing as many buttons on the keyboard as you could and as fast as you could. In dark forces II it took a long time to develop as a character with enough time to have fun with the force. In Jedi outcast you didn't have enough time to have fun using advanced sabre techniques, and in jedi academy it was overkill. I just would like to have seen a game that had more difficult mazes and puzzles in the levels . . . or maybe I'm just getting smarter . . . It literally takes about 6 hours of solid playing time to get through this one . . . oh wait, I can play it again and try to find all the secret areas. Wait till you can buy it used."
1,Disappointed reader,I bought this book primarily for information regarding accounting and general ledger systems. I read all the great reviews here and thought this would be a great book. I am very disappointed. The entire section on accounting is only 40 pages and contains only a cursory overview of accounting systems and structures. They include a CD with the book which is supposed to contain actual SQL data structures but you have to pay them $350.00 to unlock the CD. Given the depth of the book I would be reluctant to risk paying them that much for simple data structures which you can easily find elsewhere on the web for free.In all honesty I have not studied this book fully but in my opinion it was a waste of money and I will try to return it to Amazon.
1,Big disappointment,"I am extremely disappointed with this new book. The crude language is so unnecessary to the story line. I bought several copies of the first series for my elementary school library. These are the target readers, in elementary school. Good writing of any kind does not need to be littered with poor language. There are so many other good choices out there, so my advice to to choose another book."
1,Save your time and money,"A man in full ... of himself. Wolfe has a way with descriptions but that, in and of itself, does not make a 742 page book. Stop after about the first 600 pages and you'll feel better - the ending is too asinine to in any way be related to reality. I'm angry about the time wasted in finishing it."
1,House of Wax 2005 remake Review,"One of the worst remakes of all-time. The plot is stupid and has pointless filler and jump-scares. The cast are morons and so is the villian. The villian is also such a bad actor,you think he was played by Tommy Wiseau. The ONLY GOOD part of the movie is the death of Paris Hilton who is in this film. I don't care how pretty she is,she's still a horrible actress. The blood & gore is not great but pretty good. It's not subtle at all. overall,it's a lame remake at best and you should avoid it at all cost. I give this film a 1 out of 10."
1,Not worth it; poorly made,"This toy did not live up to expectations. The wand is very weak and hardly moves the metal filings around at all. My son uses a strong refrigerator magnet to play with this, but he just likes moving the filings around, and not making faces much. He is 6 y.o. and has been fascinated by magnets since he was 2 years old. This game interested him for a few minutes over a couple of days. not worth it.If you are looking for magnetic fun, I recommend magnetic super stones or magnetix building pieces or magna tiles.I would like to also mention that Find Cool Toys, the seller of this product, shipped in a timely manner, and their customer service was excellent. They did offer me another product to remove this review. I explained to them that the review does not reflect negatively on their company, just on this particular item, the Wooly Willy."
1,Run Small,"I bought these for my father for Christmas in his normal size, but they were too small. If you purchase these, make sure you order a size larger."
1,It should be thrilling but it's not...,"In ""The Manhattan Hunt Club"" John Saul takes a premise that has been done a few times (people hunting people) and moves it to a new location. Jeff converse has been falsely accused of murder and, after his death has been faked, becomes the prey for human hunters in the maze of subway tunnels and sewer system beneath the city of Manhattan.Unfortunately, a good premise does not a good book make. Saul never manages to pull ""The Manhattan Hunt Club"" above mediocrity. His characters aren't particularly interesting and, for such an exciting concept, the novel moves at a snails pace. These problems are rounded off with suspension-of-belief breaking coincidences. Somehow Saul has managed to fail to deliver intensity from a premise that almost exudes it naturally.""The Manhattan Hunt Club"" has made for TV movie written all over it. This is at best an average offering from a well-known author.Read more reviews on our official site:[...]"

1,Don't bother to pick a winner!,"My three year old grandson is frustrated because the blue car always wins. He is now a happy camper. His younger sister just likes to see the cars run. His comment was, ' what does she know'."

1,Not worth your money.,"I love Hallmark movies and western type films, but this was disapointing. I thought the story was dull and the only interesting character was the guy who killed the two lovers at the end.At least he put us out of our misery.I found it unbelieveable that a strong woman like Alex would fall in love with such a weak and indecive young man.The camara work was good and some of the locations was beautiful but I wouldn't waste your money. Over all this was a pointless and boring moving."
1,Did not receive!!,I was looking forward to receiving some peppy little music -- did not get it down loaded -- need help -- was billed but did not receive.
1,High-altitude pass through the clouds.,I read this book cover to cover and was greatly disappointed. The author's writing style leaves much to be desired. He covers a wide variety of topics. Unfortunately perhaps too many as he only gives the most superficial treatment of each. Not a compete reference. He also uses a huge number of annoying analogies. Sometimes two on one page. There are several minor errors throughout the book and the supporting web site doesn't exist. Buy a different book.
1,Needed a different title,"This movie was terrible! The acting sounded like a first rehearsal. When I heard a few years ago that the movie was in production, I was surprised that Ciara was chosen as lead. Her voice is not strong enough for the songs. But then I expected the movie was following the script of the stage play. Wrong! The only comparison of this movie to the play was Desiree Coleman, the original Doris Troy, singing ""Not Created to Fall."" Ciara, though easy on the eyes, is no actress. Maybe she acted in plays in her hometown of Riverdale, Ga., but her performance would not cut it in any performing arts high school. Now I understand why this movie went straight to DVD. The storyline was weak. Even though Vy Higgenson, the writer of the stage play, was in the movie, I can't understand why she green lighted this project. Watch this movie on tv. Save your rental money!"
1,Some things are never gonna be the same,"Sold out, not sold out - why does it matter? I'm not listening to Metallica for a while not beause I think they sold out (sick and tired of people repetetively saying that), but because the music is just not there. I'm not 14 and not from Alaska (see below), thank God, and will not hail the album cuz it's Metallica. Gone those days. Should I lesten to smth else? It's a hard knock life, it's hard knock life...No scrubs, la la la"
1,Wrong item sent...but satisfied with outcome,I had to open the package to see the connector which was NOT what I ordered. I contacted the vendor who said because I opened the package I couldn't return it. I replied that they had my money and I had a connector I couldn't use. They reconsidered; I returned item and got refund. Shouldn't have to go through this if item isn't the correct product.
1,Stopped working after 12 hours,I sent this product to my husband overseas and it only worked for 12 hrs. Very disappointed! I really had high hopes that this product would clean the bad air that he has been breathing.
1,AVOID !!!,"If you want to impress your friends with your new DVD player then (...) don't show them this film. It's a straight forward copy from a video tape that will have you reaching for the tracking button (if only) and the sound is not in sync with the picture. The acting is wooden and the plot is dire. If you are fool enough to buy this, don't come crying to me when you realise I'm right!"
1,worst movie of all time?,"The first movie was kinda passable - but how do you explain this follow-up disaster?Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law should sue their agents, screenwriter and director for this abomination (but Downy also has himself to blame for over-acting and taking the sequel money).A muddled, uninteresting and directorally over-wrought mess of a movie - the over-the-top production budget could have been far better spent against some social cause or philanthropy."
1,Shame on the NTRA,After being a fan of the Gallop Racer series for the past six years I couldn't wait till the NTRA brought out a licensed game. The preview sounded like you'd be racing/riding the famous horses of today. WRONG. I think I played for two days and I haven't touched it since. You have to skip through every single race on every single day which takes forever. I have certain horses that will win every time by daylight which is too easy. There's no challenge. You can beat the stars you unlock easy. I beat Citation (Triple Crown winner and one of the greatest of all time) with a random game horse. Save your money and go for a game in the Gallop Racer Series (I recommend 2003).
1,The jacket is misleading...,"I have been searching for a DVD of Aaliyah's collection of videosI have been unsuccessful. I bought this DVD judging by what it said on the jacket. But the chronicle was a commentary, not her work.I was disappointed because I wanted her work.The jacket is misleading. The DVD is strictly a Eulogy. Nothing more, nothing less."
1,not worth your money or time to read,I THINK THIS IS THE WORST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ IN MY LIFE.MR MCMAHAN NEEDS TO DO US ALL A FAVOR AND FIND A DAY TIME JOB.
1,Very few if any actual Cayce predictions,"This is an inspirational book a la Thurston. For me, the problem was that about 95% of the book is the author's words, with a very occasional quotation from Cayce. Also surprisingly, very little in the way of actual predictions for the 21st century. Not sure how the publisher arrived at the title for the book, perhaps to sell it?"
1,"Worthless, runny, crap","I have purchased Anthony Logistics for Men Shave Cream from Sephora before. That product was a rich, thick, cream that worked well and felt great. The only aspect of that wonderful product this had was the smell. Otherwise it had been watered down. Perhaps it is a fraudulent product this seller is selling here on Amazon, or they changed the formula (doubtful). I will go back to Sephora to purchase this product again to see if what I got here was counterfeit. I do know the product I purchased here is complete junk and a waste of money."
1,Not Worth the Price,"Pros:1. Easy installation.2. Accurate temperature readings when the sensor is placed at the right place.Cons:1. Back light is too dim. At night you have to get as close as one foot to see the digits.2. The silver cover is too shiny. You can see its reflection in the windshield. It should be a dull color like the dashboard.3. Expensive for what it does.4. You would hope the thieves are smart enough not to think it is an expensive GPS unit.Conclusion: This product is not worth buying. It has been on the market for at least two years, but you don't see the manufacturer making any improvement on things such as the back light. A Gentex auto-dimming mirror with compass and outside temperature has better value.Update on 11-5-2006: One month after installation the outside temperature sensor went dead.Update on 12-27-2006: Finally received replacement unit from the manufacturer. Customer Service was not very responsive."
1,HATED IT,I BOUGHT 3 OF THEM FOR MY 3 GIRLS FOR X-MAS. THIS WAS THEIR BIG ITEM AS WELL AS THEIR CD'S AND NONE OF THE 3 WORKED AT ALL. I HAD BOUGHT A PACK OF 36 BATTERIES AND TRIED ALL AND THEY WOULDN'T EVEN POWER ON!!!!!!!!
1,Buyers beware: Seriously toxic and clearly a waste of your money!,"This cart is made in China -- like most products today. However, this particular cart must have come from an assembly line that is especially beneath contempt. Intense off-gas started spreading immediately upon removing the plastic cover from the cart in shipping box. After trying to air it out for a day, the fumes still kept coming on strongly. The smell mainly came from the plastic wheels and foam padding on the cart handle. This is how I learned that the wheels were not made from quality rubber as advertised. I ended up throwing the cart into the trash. Buyers beware: Seriously toxic and clearly a waste of your money!"
1,Pass It Up...,"Backyard Bird Newsletter (BBN) is the companion piece to the excellent Bird Watchers Digest (BWD) that I have subscribed too for years. It is offered every other month that BWD isn't published. I picked up a subscription to it my first year with BWD for I thought it would be nice to receive something every month. Unfortunately unlike BWD which is an excellent publication for birders of all interests and levels, (see my review of it at the link) I cannot recommend the companion newsletter. Its a very thin, (about 8 to 10 pages) pamphlet style publication that carries as many ads in it as helpful and interesting articles. I never spent more than 10 minutes thumbing through it before tossing it out each month. I let my subscription to it lapse after the first year. It is definitely not worth $16 for six issues to be sure. Subscribe to BWD and sign up for their free email newsletter that is loaded with helpful hints and article highlights. And forget this option.Bird Watchers Digest"
1,The worst stragedy guide I have EVER seen...,"This is the worst stragedy guide I have ever seen, when I pay like 10 bucks for the damn thing I want all the hints with out having to go online to find out everything, thats the WHOLE reason I got the stupid thing in the first place. Okay now that I got that out of the way...here is the problem, it gives you enough hints so not to ruin the story (this is what I do like about the thing...thus the 2 stars) but, to get any more info you have to [go online] to get the stuff. TO me that kinda kills the reason to get the thing in the first place. Like I said before, the one good thing (the one and only good thing) is that it doesnt ruin the story by giving you to many hints...they really could have done better. And I want to know whos stupid idea it was to have all the extra hints online anyway."
1,WOMENS HAIR REMOVER,"I WAS SO EXCITED TO GET THIS PRODUCT. I AM 56 YEARS OLD FEMALE. I HAVE USE THE TWEEZIES INTHE PAST, AND I READ THE REVIEWS ON THIS AND THEY SEEMED TO BE GOOD. WELL AFTER USEING THIS PRODUCT AS DIRECTED I HAVE SORES WHEREVER I USED IT. IT IS IRRITATED. AND LARGES DRY SORES. I DONT KNOW WHAT TO PUT ON THEM. AND I CANT GET A DERMATOLOGIST APPT FOR A MONTH. THIS HAS TURN INTO A DISASTER. I WOULD NOT RECCOMEND"
1,"Don't go into old farm houses, haven't you ever seen a horror movie?","This movie was pretty bad. I know that it was a B-horror flick, but come on. There were a couple of good actors but most were not that good even for a B flick. Yes, this movie was a rip off from other movies, but there was one movie that the rest of the critics missed and that was Jeepers Creepers. The only reason that I gave it 2 stars was because of a couple of the actors and there were a couple of scares in it that were pretty good. I don't recommend this movie even for the B-horror fans."
1,Risky purchase,"Tried these while on holiday in Germany. Used my Iphone map to locate medieval castle from a high promentory, but was directed to look instead at what turned out to be a Baltic nudist retiree beach resort.In fantastically detailed, stable and sharp horror, I was confronted with wrinkled, hairy images that dazzled even as they nauseated.Great optics and build quality that reveal the Matrix-like horror beneath our reality.You have been warned..."
1,flimsy and garish,"I'm disappointed in these bibs. the ones I received are quite different designs from the ones represented online, and they are really very ugly; there's only one out of the five which I can bear to have my daughter wear. And beyond the aesthetic problem, they are much thinner and flimsier than they look in the picture. I got them to keep my daughter dry when she practices with a cup (she spouts like a whale). These are better than a cloth bib for that, ,but she still gets wet."
1,Way too basic,"I bought this for my child to sleep to the nature sounds. After buying it, I found you can only play the nature sounds in the ""sleep"" mode and that they will only play for a maximum of 59 minutes, and then it shuts off! Why can't it just also have an ""on"" and ""off"" button? Also, there is no volume control for the sounds, and most seem pretty loud, but ""ocean"" is the softest. Further, the sounds repeat after a very short time, about 3 seconds, so the pattern is very obvious and could get annoying. I'd say to look for a better product with more features."
1,Awful script,"Many of my fellow reviewers pay close attention to the message of love in the film. That's a good thing, but there are many better films out there that are about Christian values without relying on an awful script. Once you've caught the idea that Joshua is guess who, watching the movie fills you with dread as to how the film makers are going to exploit this awful and cynical idea for the sake of Christian values. I guess that's my main complaint: it's a film that cynically uses its premise to sell itself and its movieland version of religion and love."
1,Smelly,"This bear is used and not specified also arrived in a ziplock bag, sorta smells bad. I am disappointed about the smell."
1,Classic Cartoons,My 2yr.old Grand-daughter loves to watch Tom and Jerry. I'm glad she enjoys the same cartoons I watched as a child 40 some yrs. ago.
1,Abridgement or gimmick,"If you haven't read the hardcopy version DO NOT waste your money on this marketing gimmick. Even if you have read the book, DO NOT waste your money on this gimmick. An abridgement is a shortened form of a work that retains the sense and unity of the original. Not so here. It is a series of sound bites randomly plucked from the book. This is a sad attempt to extract additional profit from a popular book. The hardcopy version offers some interesting insights. Stay with that, you'll get much more out of it."
1,dreams of getting even,"Dreams From My Father - A Story Of Race And Inheritance, Revised EditionYou would not think this book could have been written by a person that has become the President of the country that he so vehemently despises.It's more of a manifesto to destroy what he believes to be evil."
1,Don't expect to use this with a CRT its not strong enough,Don't expect to use this with a CRT its not strong enough. The monitor bounces back and forth. One large monitor I had here brought the one part down to the desk. Lighter CRTs are OK but not very stable.
1,It's cheap,Not really easy to setup. Does not accept DHCP assigned address it must be manually configured on the network to operate as an access point. Goes off-line often but comes back when power is recycled. Ok for my purposes (occasional use) but I would not recommend for dependable wireless access.
1,fit is very poor of assembled parts.,Both top doors will not shut all the way and stay shut. If you snap the top floor into place it pushes the rear door out and cannot be closed. The lock hole is too small for the lock.
1,pure fiction from a vegetarian point of view!!,"Although well written, the author has slanted his results to fit his ""tale"" of horror and doom! If we are to believe this book, then people will be dying of CJD at an alarming rate. He states that breathing bone meal can be fatal. Logic tells you that people working in that industry are breathing bone meal on a daily basis. They should be dying at a tremendous rate according to Rhodes. I haven't read or seen on the news any such outbreak. Maybe I do not care for authors that try to scare people to ""death."" Do not believe everything you read!!"
1,Leaky Mess,"Sure the box raves about how it filters different types of sediment, but it doesn't tell you how leaky it is. We bought two (one after another) and it leaked from underneath the faucet connector both times. Tightened and retightened, but no improvement. I would not recommend this product to anyone. Didn't even get to taste the water"
1,not worth it,I was in the 14 day free trial and quit after a few days;I didn't even finish the free trial.
1,"Decent Sound, Good Mic, but it doesn't matter because...","this thing is the most uncomfortable headphones I've ever put on. How does Logitech think that a ""one size fits all"" headset will work?I cannot wear this thing for longer than 30 minutes without my ears turning red and hurting."
1,Unfunny (Blu-ray critique),Cute stars. Cute setup. Unfunny script. Negligible performances. What passes for humor these days is slight on wit and heavyhanded on overt sexual humor that lacks innuendo. In this case what few postives there were went out the door when full frontal nudity came anything but innuendo. (all hail Groucho) As for the technical aspects. The picture looked great on my big screen hi-def TV at 1080 - you could see every (ahem) 'little' detail. The sound was good.
1,Can you hear me now?,"The biggest complaint I've seen from others is that the narration is too quiet to hear over the music, and that the movie is too short. It's true, the narration is so bad that you have to crank up the volume to the point your ears bleed to make out what they are saying. And as for being short, you won't leave it in long enough to find out how long it lasts. COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY !!"
1,This Movie should be called 'How To Insult Batman Fans'.,"This movie is a slap in the face for true Batman fans, and the intellegent movie goer alike. As a Batman fan, There is no movie I hate more than this one. Avoid like the plague. This movie is Batman's ""Kryptonite"". This Movie has done more to destroy Batman than The Joker has. This movie makes 'Pluto Nash' look like GLADIATOR. This movie makes babies cry. This movie couldn't stand up to a power rangers episode. Independent research has shown that this movie can cause depression. This Movie should come with a pooper-scooper. This movie killed Clooney's career... Wait, NO, CLOONEY killed Clooney's career. OK I'm done."
1,Keep away!!,"Unless you want to be totally turn off by Henley's books, keep away from this one. This was the book that made me turn to other writers. It was a great disappointment, especially after reading 'Tempted' and other better ones. I am still wondering if i should read any more Henley books. This book is too depressing for words!!!!"
1,Silence the Voice,"Let me begin by saying that in general, I like the literary work of Dean Koontz. However, this particular story is short on action and long on describing in excruciating detail the various character's feelings and thoughts. Before you assume that I only like books with pictures in them, let me clarify that in general the descriptions of the main characters thoughts are salient to moving the story forward. However, as with salt, a little enhances the flavor and a lot destroys the taste buds. This is a case of too much salt. So much to the point of destroying my interest and rendering me hopelessly bored. I became bogged down in the inertia of the infinitesimal detail of each characters' every thought and their over analysis of their feelings which they took turns in sharing with the hapless reader. I actually lost empathy with the characters' peril and started to wish that the evil supernatural entity would dispatch with them quickly and yes, painfully."
1,easily the worst album of their discography,"I am a very commited Lillian Axe fan, but this album should have been left in the past. I see why it is an album of songs that didn't make on the other ones. The production is very raw and the tracks sound like they were just thrown together. Don't buy it!"
1,Cashmere Gloves,"These gloves were much smaller than I expected in overall size and length. Normally size 8 gloves fit my hand, but I had trouble getting these gloves on my fingers. They also stopped at my palm and did not cover my wrist. I was disappointed for the price."
1,not good,"Cute little dish rack, but if you need something for every day use, stay away. It's been about six months, it's rusted. Basically garbage. If you have limited use this might work."
1,The worst of the lot,"This is certainly the worst of all the Trek films: I have no idea what they were thinking ($$?) when they made this one.The plotline is illogical, unfocused, inconsistent, confusing and so poorly written that even some of the TNG season two stinkers (Samaritan Snare, anyone?) are more entertaining and satisfying to watch. Half the screen time you have no idea why the character is doing what it's doing. And the way they killed off Data was truly pathetic.I cannot understand what would motivate the producers to make this movie. It has no sense of wonder that made Star Trek great in Generations, First Contact or Undiscovered Country. Even Insurrection, though lame and laid-back, was true to the spirit of Trek - it was like an average season finale parts I and II combined. Nemesis plays like a cheap sci-fi B movie - avoid at all costs."
1,Love the Onion but Kindle edition is intolerably flawed,"Despite what you may feel about The Onion (I love it), there's no question in my mind that the Kindle edition of The Onion is terrible. Poor navigation, horrible formatting, not really readable."
1,Unfortunately thin and amateurish,"...The book is honestly not very good. The plot is thin, with ridiculous characters that don't amount to much more than throwaway caricatures. Even the main characters of Mark and Neil are bland and unmemorable, without any defining character traits. The mystery is not much of a mystery, and instead of building to a revelation, just meanders to a finish. Finally, there seems to be an attempt to make a statement about organized religion and homosexuality, but it comes across as ham-handed and mean-spirited. A cartoonish televangelist hates gays? Well, that's not very original, and it's certainly not fun.I want to encourage young writers, and especially ones who introduce previously unheard voices into the mainstream, but I unfortunately cannot recommend this book."
1,"dont waste you money, buy a reputable brand","I ordered 2, Neither of the bullets worked, one has no light and only is on low, the other has a light but again only on low, useless, Again I stress but a reputable brand, these are obviously rejects sold as good.TLC 5x space explorer bullet vibe vibrator ,cant return learned a lesson!gave one star ONLY because you have to to post."
1,LITTLE Toy drum.,"I ordered this drum to be used in the Nutcracker Ballet, but it is way too small. You can't tell from the photo, but it is TINY! It would be okay for a two or three year old, but not for an older child."
1,I will trow it away,"Bought this fax machine for our small office and aftr 2 weeks a little pin that holds the cover broke and I can not read faxes, they wrote a fax support line in the fax and is always busy, I lost the receipt so I can not exchange it,.....Uses a ton of print film, (expensive) I will rather use my computer fax instead...."
1,"This is NOT the right one to let in, into your DVD player","I bought this movie based on NPR's (National Public Radio)recommendation. (Usually a good source for intelligent, interesting movies; however, this movie is neither). Now, the movie was very shallow, generic, predictable, and greatly lacking in imagination. All the characters lacked depth and intelligence. This movie was plain and simple a case of ""what you see is what you get."" Often you see a movie and think it will get better; well, this is one is one of those that never gets any better. You see the first five minutes and that is as good as it gets.No mystery, no intrigue, just plain: kid bullied at school befriends vampire girl, vampire girl protects him and, in one of the most anticlimactic endings, kills the bad kids. That is the whole movie, a great, great disappointment."
1,.,"Quite possibly the stupidest Hollywood production I've ever seen in my life -- and that's saying a lot. All of the performances are awful, and the actors seem embarassed (and they should be!) The little story that is there is meandering and silly. Nicole Kidman and Tommy Lee Jones barely have a place in the movie, but given how painfully difficult it was to watch them scrape through such an inane script, I don't mind their absence. Chris O' Donnell is just laughable. Val Kilmer could've been a good Bruce Wayne, but the flashy, goofy context of this movie makes it impossible. The jokes are nerve-gratingly dumb, and the desperate aspirations of Joel Schumacher to make this a hipper, more ""fun"" Batman movie are just ... stupid. The visuals are gaudy and irritating. I did enjoy seeing the movie, but just because it left me in tears from laughing so hard at it. It's amusing, but only because it's so painfully, astoundingly terrible."
1,Does it sound like Celine?,"This certainly didn't turn me on at all, the only thing that came back to me is a need to throw up. Not only is the song taken too fast in the remixes, they all sound the same! Please, I am a die-hard Celine Dion fan, and this was a MAJOR waste of money! It would be in all the fans interests to not buy this single."
1,"Very tight, narrow fitting and uncomfortable","The design is very beautiful, but wearing the shoes is quite another. For one, it's difficult to just slip them on without pantyhose. Even then, the fold in the front pressures top of feet b/c of the narrow space; the back fold produces an uncomfortable pressure into the back of feet. Lovely design but not made for human feet (perhaps due to non-leather/stiff materials used to make it)."
1,"Dumb, but Like a Train Wreck","I can only give a book one star if it was so dumb I couldn't finish it. I did finish Bergdorf Blondes because it made me hopeful. Hopeful that it would get better. Sort of Sophie Kinsella meets Candace Bushnell then they both get ripping drunk and write a novel on the cocktail napkins. It was missing all heart, all warmth, and anything else that would make you care about what happens to the characters at the end. And truly, if you couldn't see what was coming, you probably can't read the first line on the eye chart either. It's not even about Bergdorf Blondes! It's about the Blonde's best friend! If you feel the odd compulsion to read this book, get it from the library and spend your money on something that won't make you feel silly."
1,vsx-816 audio cutting out,"like everyone else, my audio is cutting out. It works again when I off/on the receiver, but this has become a more than once daily necessity. Doesn't look like there is anything that can be done, so I guess I'll just ride the storm till I can't take it anymore. Would not recommend this or anything else along the pioneer line, as this really should have been recalled."
1,no show,"What a novel idea, asking me to rate an item I have not yet received after one month of no delivery. When can I expect delivery?"
1,Battle of the Bulge?,In Germany they called this movie The Last battle. Baron Hasso Von Manteuffel was a harsh critic he said it was an insult to both sides and failed to show the conditions and was totaly inaccurate. I agree to call this battle of the bulge is a farce. This all star farce is one of the biggest turkeys ever.
1,Weird and icky,"I'll stick to Whoppers, thank you very much. It's not like I don't enjoy expensive high end chocolate, either. These things have a weird aftertaste and too thick a gloppy layer of chocolate on them. I know they're supposed to be ""better"" malted milk balls but you can have them. I think most of the hype comes from literary people who liked Bridget Jones Diary and wanted to like these."
1,Not a good book. Not a solution for any problem,"I know beginners need a book wich talks about only a few topics, the most important. And it must be clear and not too deep way. But it doesn't mean you can take a time with each topic. This book passes over every chapter at the speed of light, leaving many issues unexplained.To all of this, it must be added the fact that the book costs as much as other really wonderfull and longer books.It's been frustrating that feeling I had while reading, as I have wasted my money and I'll have to buy another. Any search in google for oracle tutorials gives more information than that book."
1,Would love to receive this publication.,I ordered and paid for this Art Publication on Feb. 10th. Apparently it takes up to 10 weeks to receive the 1st issue. Today is March 21st and I'm still waiting to receive.
1,slimey mess,"Slime in tubes is like eating fast food. It sometimes does the trick, it sometimes makes you sick. As a professional bike mechanic, I have pulled thorns out of tubes with slime and it sometimes holds the air and sometimes a small green puddle hisses at you, almost making fun of you for filling your ties with something that looks like antifreeze and has the consistency of snot. There are more effective and lightweight latex tire fillers commonly used on tubeless tires that I have pulled countless thorns out of with no leakage, but to me the best possible fix are Rema patches. Never once, when properly applied, have I had one of those fail."
1,Not even close to picture,"The description for this item says ""exact mask may vary slightly from picture"" which is a gross exaggeration. The mask they send is a much cheaper completely different mask. I have the mask that is pictured and it is of a much higher quality than the flimsy piece of junk I was sent. There was no padding or packaging in the box and two of the five ""masks"" I ordered arrived crushed. I also think the box they used for shipping is way too small - it is only one inch thick, something you might ship a book in - not items that people need to have arrive in tact. These masks sell for 2.97 but I wouldn't pay a quarter for them, that is how cheap and lousy they are. Mine are going straight back to the company - I'm just sorry I have to pay to ship this junk twice."
1,Not what I expected!!!,I was so frustrated with the cookie press. From what was written about it I thought it was going to work great for my Xmas cookies. It was so decieving. It was called a power cookie press there was no power to it. I wanted a electic one and I thought the battery one would do as well I was mistaken.
1,Didn't look at this one at all,"I really wasn't very impressed with the outline. I would recommend Scoland the Best and then the Eyewitness guide as a must if traveling to Scotland. It was not very specific, and the tours for the most part were too long. Most were 2 days, and we were in different places every other night which really didn't allow us to do what the tours suggest."
1,I am not a betta bowl hater. This just isn't a betta bowl,"For the price this is a ridiculously useless item. You cannot house a betta in this, because it isn't much larger than the tiny cups they're sold in at pet stores. If you can put your betta in a bowl/vase that holds over 1 gallon of water and has a heater, I believe your betta should be okay. And so, I am not one of those people who screams animal abuse at betta bowls. This bowl allows a betta absolutely NO swimming room. For cheaper, you can buy a large enough vase to put him in. Just don't put him in this tiny contraption because even you will be miserable watching him in there."
1,Very disappointing,"I was disappointed with this story. I had never read anything by this author. So, after reading great reviews on this book I decided to give it a try. I felt as though the writer didn't take the time really create chemistry between the characters and I think the story was a little rushed. I didnt fall in love with the characters. In my opinion this story fell short of emotion. If you want something with a similar story line read ""Dont die my love"" by Lurlene Mcdaniel it is a great read."
2,Dry Nasal,This product was recommended by a professional ENT physician with some interest in homeopathic medicine. It moisturizes and prevents bloody nose caused by dryness.
2,Brilliant & Beautiful,"After listening to this stunning masterpiece, you will KNOW that Tiesto is the greatest DJ in the world, hands down. I started listening to him during his ""Magik"" days (which I still listen to more than five years after some of them were released), and this album cemented him as #1 in the minds of millions. His ""In Search of Sunrise"" series (three volumes thus far) is unbelievable, and this is the album that started it all. There is no reason on the face of this earth for you to not go and buy this album right now. Crazy as it may sound to some, you will be a better person after having heard it."
2,Better than Watchmen,"For real. This comic is better than Watchmen. And that's saying a heck of a lot. This is what started my love affair with Alan Moore's writing. The fact that you're reading this review trying to decide to buy it is suspect. Have you ever read Moore??? Of course anything he did for Image doesn't count as he even admitted that was all .... So stop reading and buy the book, it's a piece of graphic novel history.Seriously."
2,Good for the REAL basics,"This is no doubt a very BASIC book on Cinematography from 1965 (but still applicable today)- yet if you are unfamiliar with the basic Five C's of shooting, then it is a good tool for learning these rules. I recommend it for film students new to camera work. But if you have been working with shooting for awhile, it may be a little too basic."
2,Best Inexpensive Skin Lotion on the Market,"I have been using this product for over a year and swear by it as part of my daily skin care routine. No topical skin lotion will permanently alter the look and feel of your skin, so I never expected those sorts of results from Boots No 7 Restore & Renew Beauty Serum. What I have noticed is how much softer and more supple my skin is and how much the appearance of my fine wrinkles is minimized when I wear the product. On days when I have had to use other skin lotions, even ones much more expensive then this, my skin has not felt or looked as good. For the best results I use Boots No7 Restore & Renew Beauty Serum under a high SPF sun screen such asNeutrogena Ultra Sheer Dry-Touch Sunblock, SPF-70, 3-Ounce Tubes (Pack of 2)to minimize further sun damage to my skin."
2,Very Nice Product,This product worked fine for me. I followed the directions carefully and was able to get a nice stain on my hand where it was applied. My only minor complaint is that it really should have been mixed better by me before putting into the bottle applicator. Some of the henna was a bit looser than the rest and your henna will gradually spread a bit while laying on the skin before drying. Just make sure it's mixed well before putting in your applicator and you should be fine. Other than that the directions were clear and easy to follow. I usually practice with cones but really liked the bottle type applicator that comes in this kit as well. Earth Henna also has their own website to order other kits and supplies if you really like this type of kit. Good Luck!~
2,hilarious!,something great to read! it's hilarious! i just may buy a copy for all of my girlfriends for christmas! great light reading...
2,I like it,I wanted a bigger pot than the ones that came with the ten piece set. If you're looking for a dutch oven this is it. It's the perfect size for spaghetti or fettuccine. This is the best price that I have found anywhere--online or at stores.
2,A brilliant and inspirational book!,"As an experienced quiltmaker with a strong Art background, I am constanly impressed with the talent and creativity of quilters. Ms Masopust is an artist in the truest sense of the work. This book is incredibly inspirational, but is also straightforward enough to be of practical use. I can't wait to start deigning my own landscape quilt. This book gives you the technical information without being prescriptive. a must-have for all creative quilt makers!"
2,Outstanding,"An enormously enjoyable read about two of the greatest leaders of the 20th century, Franklin and Winston provides a rare glimpse into this complicated relationship, from Winston's almost childlike admiration of FDR to FDR's clever but hurtful deception of Winston at Tehran and again at Yalta. Beautifully written and with great insight. I was also glad that the photos shown in the Kindle were large and clear enough to view well."
2,HD Tracks 24/48 PCM Audio is Superior To Blu-Ray 24/48 DTS HD MA,"Comparing the HD Tracks 48/24 PCM to the BR 48/24 DTS HD MA on the same player (Oppo BDP-95).Oddly the HD tracks is much louder, but it's also MUCH more musical. I would recommend the hd tracks edition for those who's primary concern is the 2.0 audio."
2,Best on the topic,"After buying a couple of books on COM+ (or at least had COM+ in the title), I either returned them or did not learn anything. This book offered me an excellent hands on explanation of COM+ features. I really enjoyed it and recommend it. I also got the chance to learn some VB along the way and understanding how implementation is different between VB and VC++. I still won't use VB however."
2,Great sound,"The sound quality is amazing! The price is unbeatable. Only draw back is I can't find an easy way to store these headphone when I am on the move. I can't hang them around my neck, and they are too bulky to put into my pocket. Being someone who loves good sound...these defiantly have better sound than most of the higher cost headphones I have listened to."
2,great book!,I have great memories of my father reading this book to me and my sister when we were kids. Fantastic story. Too bad they just don't make them like this anymore.
2,"You say goodbye, I say hello","I am a serious Beatles/McCartney fan and collector. I attended two of Paul's shows in 2002. They were both really good shows, and this CD is among the best concert CDs in my collection. Age seems to do Paul McCartney good. He can still rock out, and can sing beautifully. Much of the music here is from the '60s, including a few songs that he had never played live before. The new material comes through strong for the most part. On the whole a fine concert by Sir Paul. There is one piece of bad news: although every song in the concert is presented, all of the chatter between songs has been deleted. This means his enthousiastic greeting (""We have come to rock you tonight!""), his passionate words for John and George, the band introductions, and the humorous stories behind some songs (those of you who attended these shows will know what I'm talking about) are all missing. But the music is excellent, and Paul will probably never do another tour like this one, so enjoy."
2,Breaking Away - disappointed with ending :(,The movie is great! but why did they cut off the ending? This is where they have in writing what all the boys did with their lives. I was very disappointed.
2,Precious Moments Figurine,"The Precious Moments ""Together is The Nicest Place To Be"" Figurine was a great addition to my Best Friends collection. She recently moved away after being in our home for over 21 years. She loved the piece and was happy with the meaning of it. It was delivered way in advance of Christmas and the packaging and wrapping were perfect."
2,Excellent!!,"The Motorola RAZR V3 Magenta Pink Phone from T-Mobile is FINALLY available at amazon.com!!! soooooooooo happy!!!! saw this phone at t-mobile.com and wanted to buy it already, but amazon has it now, so i got one already!!! the phone is just awesome like every other RAZR there is. if you like pink lyk me, this phone is great for you. xDD"
2,funny lady,"erma,we miss you. she was a hoot and her books are great reading. another for your erma bombeck collection. funny!!"
2,Christmas with Jackson 5,"All songs are good, but I love so much Santa Claus Is Comin' To Town, this is my favourite version."
2,6 female authors tackle the ancient world,"Hoberman's collection of 13 essays investigates the work of 6 female authors (Mitchison, Butts, Riding, Bentley, Bryher, and Renault) who wrote at the end of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century in England. Chapters 1, 2, 8, and 13 are very general as they look at the nature of education and gender roles in England during the lifetimes of these six authors. At times her analysis of how the real lives of authors are reflected in their work seems stretched to the limit -- but this could be claimed in most literary analysis. As a writer, I can say that yes, our lives affect our work, but how it affects it can only be truly understood by talking to the author herself and there is no evidence that Hoberman has done this. She uncovers a good number of books which I did not know exist and so I'm off to find a few of them."
2,Needs more Jamie Saft,"I'll second the opinion of previous reviewer 'sac' who has hit the nail on the head when he says that he wishes there was more of composer Jamie Saft's efforts on here.Exactly.The soundtrack of the movie itself is a five-star effort. It's an integral part of the intense, visceral feel of the film. But the soundtrack as released on CD gets docked a star. It's Saft's compositions that drive the film. There simply has to be more of it on here, even if it meant pushing out some of the other works to get it done. I realize that's probably not the most commercial thinking in the world, but...that's two of us so far registering the same disappointment."
2,Great for itchy skin,"My vet recommended this product for my dog's itchy skin. It works, and I even bought some for my sister's dog, too. I highly recommend it if your dog is itchy. I bathe my dog once every other week or so during the itchy season, and it keeps her from scratching and biting herself all the time. I used it on my last dog, too, who was elderly, and I didn't have any problems with it with her either."
2,Great start!,Wonderful start to the new season. Excited to see where it goes from here. I'll be sad to see Amy and Rory go though when the time comes for them to move on.
2,Excellent Cooler Bag,"This insulated lunch cooler bag has plenty of room for a container of salad, an apple, a hardboiled egg, condiments and two ice packs. What more could you ask for?"
2,Make the Butternut Shrimp Bisque -- the recipe is GREAT!,"Dawn Davis's book is a treasure trove of information for all kinds of foodies -- from the professional chef to hopeful beginners like myself who just love to read about all things food. The stories from the chefs are fascinating -- intimate enough so the reader feels like he or she is in that chef's shoes for the moment. The back of the book is filled with really useful stuff, like names and addresses of cooking schools (both stateside and abroad), lists of cookbooks by the chefs profiled, and information about trade publications. This book makes you feel like a real food insider, which in NYC (or any area for that matter) is a very cool thing to be these days. The recipes are unusual and surprisingly easy to make (not to mention yummy). Impress your friends! The photos are stylish as well. This is a book you will want to display."
2,"Heavy duty look and feel, works great on heavy doors!","This is not a wimpy lil doorstop; this is heavy-weight, with all-metal construction and about twice the heft that I expected for the low price. It works great on the weighted door to the garage that we wanted to prop open; it is desighed to close automatically with no stopper mechanism. This kickdown doorstop fit the bill perfectly, was delivered free and cost less than a fiver. Perfect!"
2,Best little baby bike seat!!,"This little seat is worth taking the time to review! I looked at every bike seat out there and read every review I could get my hands on before we settled on the iBert. My baby is almost 9 months old and I've had the seat a couple of weeks. She loves it! She is small-average 8-9month size. It fits her. The low back on the seat allows her head to be above it so it doesn't push her helment forward when we are riding. She can reach the lap bar so she has something to hold onto. Super Super easy to install- took like 5 minutes- REALLY. I have a crusier bike, so I didn't have to worry about leg room. I am shorter, and was worried about keeping my balance with her on a bike, and it is barely noticable when she is on it with me. Doesn't affect the balance of the bike at all! She loves it and so do we!! It gives all 5 of us in the family the opportunity to get out on our bikes together. I would buy it again, hands down."
2,He did it again!,"James made yet another astounding album. He produced it hisowndamnself (first time, I think) and he and the band sound great.What else is there to say? Buy it, love it, buy one to give to Granny for Christmas too!Lee in SC"
2,Awesome,I just used it for the first time today and my carpet hasn't looked this good in a long time. With 4 dogs my carpet gets dirty fast but the steam vac did wonders. A very satisfied customer
2,I've been up since midnight reading this..,"This book definitely followed the trend of the other Harry Potter books in being better written and longer than the one preceding it. JK Rowling seems to get more precise and less like she's floundering around for ideas like in the first books as she keeps writting them. But I don't feel like going into the details of the book, I'm too tired."
2,Great Show,It really draws you into the way of life that these people had. I love that you get the views of the servants as well as the aristocratic family.
2,Informative and entertaining from an insider,"This book is written by an experienced casino surveillance guy. While many of the stories in it are entertaining to everyone, it is clearly written for experienced card counters (if you know the difference between hi-lo and AO2, you qualify). The primary focus of this text is how to stay ""under the radar"", as any counter knows that this is your best defense. Interestingly, there are some fascinating tidbits about making it more difficult for surveillance to get an accurate analysis on your play once they DO decide to track you. In fairness to the author, I won't give any examples, but any person with a $10k+ bankroll will find the $50 price on this book well spent."
2,"MacKenzie's keen insights useful beyond the workplace, too","We were absolutely entranced! Perhaps because we never have had to survive in a really major corporate hairball, MacKenzie's observations and explanations became much more a personal issue.Would that all our psychologists and psychiatrists be as adept at observing people's behaviors, discerning their states of mind and explaining it for one and all without jargon or gobbledygook. An unpretentious masterpiece by a brilliant mind and an unassailably creative person, in OR out of the giant hairball."
2,Ludlum takes a back seat,"Picked this book up from the bargain table and placed it among the literary giants. I loved this book!! Fast paced, great characters, and tremendous action along with a story that will keep anyone on the edge of their seat. Great surprise ending."
2,"OK, but far from perfect","I am slightly disappointed in the content of this video, it is a little corny, and uncomfortable to watch at times for adults. My daughter (2 1/2) gave it more positive feedback, as she does actually watch and talk about what she is seeing, but in the end, it hasn't really helped with potty training other than the fact that she LOVES Elmo, and she does at least watch it. Hopefully, she will eventually be interested in acting out what Elmo talks about doing on the video, instead of just watching and listening to it. We will see...."
2,Very Pretty,"The color does not look like the bottle, closer to a greyish blue as opposed to a purple shade. However it is still a gorgeous color and I would still reccommend it."
2,Why do authors do this?,"Another good book from Brad Thor, except for the last paragraph! Why do authors feel they must leave the reader hanging... is it to make sure their next book gets read purchased? A good author, such as Thor, needn't ruin a great story by ending with a ""hook"" to their next book.... it's not a 1930's Flash Gordon Serial. I enjoyed this book a lot... then I read the closing paragraph and Blammo - what could have been a neat, tidy, satisfying ending gets turned into crap. Too bad."
2,Perfect,"I bought this saw at a the local Home Depot and haad no problems with it so far. I'm just a kid and i've already installed trim in my parent's basement after a flood and it looked perfect. The standard blade, 60 teeth, i've counted all of them, that comes on it is enough for trim work but the more teeth, the better. This saw gets plenty of use, and it still cuts a perfect 90 degree angle since I got it out of the box. I recommomend this to any one looking to buy a compound, not that small nor light, miter saw. I would have bought the sliding, but unfortunately, that is way too expensive."
2,Algebra 1,This book was in excellent condition. The delivery was as promised.The pages are in tact and we will make great use of it. I strongly recommend this site for ALL your book needs!!
2,Very smooth... for cloudy days,"Nice companion for cloudy days. A neet work.Riders of the Ancient Winds is the ""tour de force"" and Tribal Runner makes the rest..."
2,These are a staple in my medicine cabinet,"I suffer from allergies and sinus problems. Those headaches can be blinding. I use these patches, cut into smaller sizes, to target where my headache is and get relief faster. It is also excellent for the sore muscles, and certainly less messy than muscle relaxant creams.I like how they work and will continue to purchase this product."
2,Dragon's Kin,If you are a fan of Anne McCaffrey's dragon riders and want a different trip to Pern then this is a worthwhile addition to your collection. Difficult to tell the difference between the two authors.
2,Great Deal,I originally bought this book for my class at the school bookstore. It was over a hundred dollars but this was such a great find. It came a week before the latest delivery time and the seller sent it out really quickly and punctually. I would buy from this seller again.
2,Frantoia Barbera Oil,"The product has excellent flavor for finishing dishes, especially pasta. I make my own infused oil by adding sliced garlic and I saute everything in it. Nothing better for the price."
2,St. Rita DVD,"The life of St. Rita ... A Catholic movie. Highly recommend! Good story, well directed and produced."
2,Good Idea,"When you're deciding whether or not to buy a GBA SP you have to ask yourself one question: Is it worth shelling 100 dollars for a GBA with a new shape, front light, and rechargable battery? If your answer is yes, then get this one immediately. Keep in mind there are no special games made for SPs only. It has the same graphical technology as the original GBA."
2,Good Movie,"I watched Collateral for about 10 minutes and fell in love with Foxx's charecter. Foxx play ""Max"" taxi driver with dreams but not actions. Tom Cruise plays ""Vincent"" a hitman that is as cool as ice and you can not help but like him. Throughout the movie Max drives Vincent across LA to different assasination points all the while discusing everything from the philosophy of killing a man to the improvisation of jazz. Overall I thought the movie was great. I thought the screen play was spot on, the plot twist was not predictable, and the way Mann filmed LA at night was simply beautiful. The scene where the car was parked at a light and you see the silhouette of the palm trees against the incandescent LA sky was gorgeous, along with the three coyotes. The only thing i did not like about the movie was the shift from a psychological thriller to a shoot-em-up action movie near the end, i really enjoyed the dialogue a lot."
2,Good,"This is a pretty good album from young Australian band, ""Killing Hiedi"". The album was sitting at #1 in Australia for about 4 or 5 weeks. The single, ""Mascara"" went to #1 for about 5-8 weeks in Australia. The single, ""Weir"" made it to #6 in Australia after sitting around in the top 20 position for about 10 weeks. Good album."
2,Surprise!,"I bought this set because it was the only way to get the DVD STRANGE CARGO which was directed by Frank Borzage (7th HEAVEN, STREET ANGEL, etc.). I took a look at SADIE McKEE because it was directed by Clarence Brown and was pleasantly surprised. It's a fascinating little melodrama that never goes over the top. It's alway fun to discover unknown titles that turn out to very entertaining."
2,Works well once you get it set up properly,I got this to hook my satelite receiver up to the internet. Setup was a pain and I wound up resetting my router's wireless security to get it to work. Setup on a security enabled network involves plugging the unit into a computer and manually configuring the computer's TCP/IP settings before you can get to the configuration screen to input your security key.Hooking it up to an Xbox or on an unsecured network would probably have been much easier.After that I just plugged it into my receiver's ethernet port and it was immediately recognized. The unit is very compact and isn't much bigger than a deck of cards. Overall I'm very pleased with the way it works. It's an excellent low-cost way of getting any ethernet equiped device hooked up to a wireless network.
2,Good for beginning or intermediate reader,"It is a good book for beginning or intermediate reader who like to know more about logistics and supply chain management. If the reader has financial background, it will be much better. The language is quite easy to understand as I am a foreigner. Full of realistic cases will make you more interest in reading this book."
2,HS850 is a Winner!,This unit is lightweight and has VERY clear audio. It is totally a win in my book.
2,fascinating story.,It was really interesting to hear about this guys life while in a Bolivian prison. Hard book to put down.
2,Its a cool movie to see the feelings of the people of 96,"I think this is one of the best climbing movies out because it show a more in depth view of what happend on Everest. It also shows some of the feelings that the climbes had, just like the book, instead of the movies that just tell the sicentifc explaintions of Everest. So thats why i give this vido 5 stars."
2,love it,"i got into BoC about three years ago, and my listening habits have never quite been the same. BoC has this insane way of making one addicted to their sound...to their vibe. Twoism is the latest addition to my BoC catalogue...i now have all albums by this wonderful duo out of Scotland. Twoism is very complex, yet very simple. it does sound like an early release, but don't let that fool you. Twoism carries quite a dark underlying tone...the second track, Oirectine, is my favorite. the whole album is phenomenal....if you like BoC at all, you owe it to yourself to get this collection of music. put on some headphones, play track two, close your eyes, and drift...peace,cic"
2,HIS BEST WORK EVER TURNS ME ON!!!!!!,I love his guitar playing and his stories really touch my life. This is a must have!
2,No power adapter included! Order it separately!,"I have not really tested the product yet, BECAUSE there is no power adapter included. It needs to be ordered separately. You need to order the Yamaha PA3C or PA3B Power Adapter (unless you already have one of course [haha]). Both of these are mentioned on the box as possible adapters. If you read the description on Amazon's site carefully you will find that it only mentions the PA3B, which is not available via amazon. However, the PA3C is possible to order, so get it as well in case you are considering this product. Just figured that all potential buyers should be aware of the issue. The lack of an adapter was not clearly emphasized (it is in the fine print)in the product description. Hmmm! I was not very happy at the moment I realized it......."
2,Castle in the Sky DVD (aka = Laputa ),"I have an import version of this movie.IT IS ONE OF THE BEST ANIME I HAVE EVER SEEN.The animation is Very good, but what makes this Anime 'One of the best' is its Story.If you have not seen this Title and you like anime I suggest you buy it, or at least make an attempt to see it. (I plan to Buy the US Release of this title as well. If Disney Ever gets around to makeing it.){I think they have the rights to the Miyazaki films}I am not sure but I think that Princess Mononoke is the only Miyazaki film to be release on DVD in the US so-far.(note: ""Kiki's Delivery Service"" was released on vhs. GET IT TOO!)"
2,Everything you need to know on Texas vegetable gardens!,"I haven't tried a vegetable garden of my own yet, but it's something I've wanted to do since we bought our house. My mom had a vegetable garden growing up, but that was in Minnesota. I didn't know what I could grow or when I could grow it, and this book really outlines everything you need to know on growing a vegetable garden in Texas, and organically. Having read this book, I feel that I can become an expert gardener! Or at least a few steps up from novice :)"
2,The Great Quake of '06,"Bay Poetics is a marvel. It's like poet and editor Stephanie Young climbed an immense circus ladder with all eyes upon her, gazed steelily from the platform, and jumped into space assured a trapeze would be there to find her when she reached out. 2 years in the making, and published just in time for the earthquake centenary, this anthology shakes up all lines and schools to offer a unique stratigraphy of San Francisco and environs at the edge of the 21st century. It's a collection no one else could have assembled, but one I think people will be looking back to for years to come. Here in San Francisco it already feels indispensable for anyone seriously involved with poetry. I hope it breaks into the sunlight of wider attention to prove what you've always suspected: that the Bay Area's really just a collective state of mind."
2,A Fun Read,"This is a very quick, entertaining read. Great for an airplane ride or while sitting in a doctor's waiting room. It's funny, interesting, and any woman over 50 will relate."
2,Good Sequel,"This is a good sequel to The Island Stallion, though it's hard to write about a return to a secret place and make it as interesting as the initial discovery of that place. This book is a bit disturbing because of the villain's use of force against animals. Still, the story is interesting in its own right and also as a sequel."
2,There's no place like home (so where am I?),"In 1986, while bemaoning the death of Minor threat, hearing that Bad Brains had broken up (rumor had it that HR had died) and learning to like Metallica, my friend from DC came up with an incredible tape of demos from Ian's new band, Fugazi. The tape became a local classic, dubbed and copied untill it was hardly audible. We had the stupendous Fugazi shake the floorboards of our house twice in '87 and '88. One of my favorite live bands of all time, for sure, their studio albums always pale in comparison. I'm glad to read reviews from all the people who love ""13 Songs,"" but all I can say to them is ""damn, you should've heard that demo tape..."" Well, this album sounds as close to the raw fury of that demo as you're going to find on Amazon.com, so you might as well buy it."
2,Nice piece for costume jewelry,The picture was very nice. The actual product a little bigger than anticipated. All in all a nice piece of fun costume jewelry. I enjoy it.
2,a child's triumph,"Most books don't bring tears to my eyes--especially not children's books. ISH is moving because we've all had the childhood experience of being told, ""NO, you're not good enough."" But, o, for the person that sees the skill and effort and says, ""I like it.""I'm buying copies of this book as a gift for friends. I love it."
2,Good Christmas equipment,"This is a hard to find item in the USA. It is used in making English plum pudding. You put the pudding into the mold, close the tight-fitting lid, and steam it. I had a hard time finding ANY pudding molds, and this was the only non-stick model that I ran across on the market. Amazon delivered promptly and it was just as advertised. Recommended without reservation."
2,Fantastic,"I miss THIS Christopher Nolan. His second best film, after 'Memento'. Far better than any of the Batman movies, and really, isn't anything better than his terrible remake of 'Insomnia'?"
2,American Hero,This is a story about a Christian Hero with Integrity far beyond the norm. Our country needs more Leaders like this. Awesome Man!
2,Very scary and mysterious book,This book is always keeping you on your toes you just never know whats going to happen next.It is one of the best books I have ever read! It's about this girl named justine and she is new at school and she wants to fit in so she decides to throw a party for some of the kids she wanted to get to know more. So she did and while they were at the party many strange things were happening like people went missing and even some one had died and you would never guess who was the master mind of all these strange things happening until you read the end of the book. This book is very good and i think you should read it if you like your heart throbbing threw the whole book.
2,Awesome chips,"Great bbq chips. Not greasy. Great flavor. Better than most I've tried and I consider myself a lifelong conesuir of chips. If you like Cape Code chips -- you will surely like these. Unfortunately it seems they don't sell them in stores on the west coast anymore.I'm finding it pays to buy chips like this in bulk, especially when you get a deal like this. The only thing for me is they use a little sugar in the ingredients (the ingredients aren't listed on amazon for some reason) -- but they don't taste too sweet and the rest of the ingredients are very natural. This is the second time I've bought these from Amazon. The first time I got the small 1.5 oz bags. They won me over. Enjoy!"
2,"Finally, one that works","After having pottery ones that are porous and do not work, this little gem keeps the butter fresh."
2,A Wonderful Book on a Fascinating Founding Father,"Ellis is becoming my favorite biographer. This book is an excellent book on Jefferson because, as the title suggests, it neither lionizes nor condemns Jefferson but rather approaches him as a notoriously complex and very real human being. Ellis has a keen sense of what we want to know and answers the questions that we all have about Jefferson: What was going through his mind when he wrote the Declaration of Independence? What's the latest on the Sally Hemings controversy? What kind of country did Jefferson want America to be and how much of his vision was realized? What kind of personality did he have? How could a slave-holder say that all men are created equal? All these questions and more are answered in this relatively small book.John Adams was right. Thomas Jefferson not only survives but is alive and well and more mischivously paradoxical than ever!"
2,A bit confusing,"The biggest attractive of the movie are the Jedis, we finally see them really in action, and we see plenty of them from different wordls. The love scenes make of this movie a bit heavy, and combats a bit confusing. Wasn't Anakin too young for Amidala? And why a fight between combat robots and Clone troopers? I don't understand that."
2,A wonderful telling of the Apollo 8 story,"This book was written for the student of history by a student of history. If you have read other accounts of the Apollo program but longed for more detail about this specific flight, you will love this book. Mr. Zimmerman does an excellent job of putting Apollo 8 in its historical context."
2,Stolen Identity,"This novel was a page turner from the beginning. The story is plausable and captured my attention. Brian Regrut gives enough information to keep the inquiring mind working. While Debbie is in the Mexican prison I couldn't keep my mind on the rest of the story until I knew she would be okay.As the reader progresses through the story, the furtile mind takes over, but Regrut keeps one step ahead.The only disappointing thing about this novel is the ending. I am left wondering on all fronts. This leads me to think that there is a sequal out there somewhere. Maybe some sluthing is in order."
2,Utada Hikaru's Talent Shines Thru,"While the video is strange the song is better to listen to. The UK version is worth buying so buy the American release or Japanese release version since it's cheap. 80 dollars for a single with three songs on it is too much. Not even CD Japan, Play-Asia, or YesAsia charge that much for a CD"
2,This is a great violin for both beginners and advanced players,"I took a chance on this violin, and I am really glad I did. The sound quality of this violin is truly excellent. The finishing job is good, but not super. The strength of this violin is its beatiful sound quality. My opinion is that the finishing quality is pretty much worth what you are paying for, but the sound quality is at least worth 3 to 4 times the price of this unit."
2,"Good Book, Poor Reviewrs","I found the book very good for someone new to Direct X especially if you want it to tie into MFC.As for the reviewers who complained about it not running on NT. DirectX only works on NT 5/2000 not NT 4. If you do not already know this you probably need to go back and learn some straight Win32 API programming.And yes if you want to program Direct X you sure better know how to program in C/C++ and COM as well as understand ""BASIC"" oop methadologies. I am tired of these reviews that have no merit behind them. If you do not know what you are talking about...do not write a review."
2,Sunny Day does it agatin!,"It is good to see these guys back together again! Jeremy Enigk follows up How It Feels To Be Something On with incredeble lyrics and the guitar rifts are excellent. If you are a Sunny Day fan, get this CD."
2,Service,"I was just sitting here thinking about my purchase.So I go online to read the reviews and low an behold, my package arrived Im excited and it happens to me everything ok! but one lousy battery will not charge.Oh joy here goes phone tag or e-mail seeking the RMA# like pulling teeth! P.S I WILL GIVE THEM ONE MORE CHANCE AND THAT IS it!"
2,Loud bass for cheap price,I bought 2 of these 4 years ago and the last one just kick the bucket. These subs sound really good. With the proper amp they will give you a nice clean hard hitting bass while they last. Be warned that because these are made from plastic over time they will start to crack from heat(like mine did) and the bass will start getting distorted.
2,More Than Just a Smattering of Stories,"Joyce's only published collection of short stories feels like a whole work, instead of a smattering of pieces, the idea running throughout the collection that Dubliners (and perhaps humanity) are all looking for adventure of some kind. Whether adventure is finally settling down in life or not wanting to settle down, the adventure is that next unknown and shows itself in different forms throughout the stories.Reviewed by Jonathan Stephens"
2,A Must-Have book for amateur Egyptologists !,"..... The world's top Egyptologist takes you to the most exciting temple in Egypt !!..... Ever since my first trip to Egypt in 1985, Abu Simbal has been my favorite place. The huge temples carved out of the mountainside, (which were moved when the Aswan High Dam was built), are incredable works of art and architecture...... This book aptly illustrates the beauty of the 60 - foot states of Rameses the Great, and his beloved wife, Nefertari...and Dr. Zahi Hawass brings to life the stories depicted in the carvings inside the temples...... There are also the photos of the 4 statues in the sanctuary of the larger temple, which are illuminated by the rising sun twice a year....... Dr. Hawass, the Director of the Egyptian Antiquities Department, brilliantly captures the wonder of this event in this book...... If you can't get to Egypt, and Abu Simbal, in person, this book is the next best thing."
2,Good Cover,"Covers my grill and has much thicker material than the cover I had, which was slowly ripping to shreds. The pick up handles and tool storage pouch on top are nice touches."
2,Inspiring,"Not only a creative idea, but one that combines natures ultimate creativity, with the creativity of a literary Master. Fascinating, well written book, full of photographs and sketches."
2,All Season Color,A perfect color for all seasons! A high quality polis that doesn't chip easily and the color is great. Not too dark for summer and not too light for winter.
2,Christmas Lights done well on TV in the comfort of home,"I took a chance and ordered this DVD for the holiday season coming up, and I gotta say I'm very impressed with the presentation and production of this DVD. Borderline Media did a great job of capturing the Christmas vibe perfectly with this DVD. The houses and lights that are captured are completely stunning, and the music is really excellent. I do prefer the Jazzy 'Charlie Brown-Esque' music over the Country selections, but it's still done well.) Overall, this is a really great package and I can't wait to share this with friends and family on Christmas Eve."
2,Have to read it!,"This book was hilarious. I loved her journals, they gave a look into what she was really thinking and feeling, even when she appeared calm and together on the outside. It's a total crack up! I was happy (and a little embarrassed) to read I wasn't the only one with the ""all occasion black dress"" - I just never knew how many occasions, and how many different ways it could be used! Her ability to laugh at herself is refreshing."
2,A singular talent,"Her words were always her words, her voice was always evident in each word she put to paper. I heard her speak at a Writer's Workshop seminar at the University of Cincinnati when I was a senior in High School. She shares the same birthday as another one of my favorites (Prince)and she writes about her experiences as a person of color and as a product of her enviroment. Everyone comes from some place, and in her works you will get to see this place and meet the people and part of you will feel as if you grew up with her. This is a definite must have for anyone looking for the best of the comtemporary poets. You won't be disappointed."
2,Great way to help the environment!,"I know that sounds like a corny tag line for this review but my aunts got myself and my sister a kindle. I received it on Thanksgiving. Once I opened the package and bought a book I was pretty much sold. This is a fantastic device. I am all for buying less paper in my life, I have too much clutter as it is and I do love reading. Honestly I have issues reading books and plays off computer screens and I love this device, no problems with the screen at all. It looks just like my regular books. I also don't have to hold down the pages when I'm all the way near the end of the book! At any rate, the Kindle is a little slow to load the next page, and I wish there were page numbers because I show it off to friends and often end up losing my place. Other than that, I love it because I can always have a book on me!"
2,Wonderful Story but-----------------,"Wonderful story set in the wilds of an Island off Canada.The characters were wonderfully down to earth.Along with the mystery of why Eva Haines second cousin, Doris Bonhomme dislikes the Lords so much.Little Fanny is an engaging 5 year old who has a very vivid imagination. Silas Lord only wants to protect his daughter.The reasons why lead Eva a merry chase for the answers.The one fly in the ointment was having Eva admit, even to herself, that she has had previous lovers? Not much to say for her character or what she thinks is love.Men are like that, yeah they are. Humph!Still a good story - worth reading!Ah well!"
2,a lot of decals,"Bought these for my son for Christmas. I was thinking I'd get one or two sheets of decals for the price- There were a lot of decals in the package. Every sport and an assortment of logos. He's very, very pleased with his Duke room!!"
2,Run Large; Great Otherwise!,"I purchased this for my 5 year old who wear size 12 shoes. Although the sizing states it is good for size 11-2; these fall off if he kicks hard. However, he will grow into them and they are nice because they will grow with him. He loves that he can swim much faster with these on."
2,"Likable story, moves well.","...Good, strong, likable hero. Not the typical alpha male. Hester was good too. She was stubborn and pig-headed at times; but the author never pushed it too far. I gave this 4 stars cause I liked the fact that it didn't have any annoying sub-plots. This is my first book by this author. I'm now looking for more. I hope she wrote about the foster sister, Mia."
2,I was buried alive that nite!,"Besides the vocals being somewhat rough,and the music a little raw,the show was great that nite,I realy enjoyed hearing this music from that show,just because I was there."
2,Rubicon,I just ordered this and so have not seen it yet. Just wanted to post that AMC's TV show Rubicon forced me to order this!
2,Quiet Play,"I got this for my daughter when she was 20 months, just before a cross-country car trip and major move. It (along with its companion, the ""Toddler Tote"") entertained her for the two-week period from the time her toys were packed in our old home till the time they were unpacked in our new home. She still pulls them out and plays with them from time to time. The carry case is *not* meant to withstand toddler handling, but the pieces themselves have proven quite durable, and have a way of reappearing again despite my daughter's best attempts to scatter them to the winds."
2,Looking forward to reading it.,"I gave it five stars on the strength of two poems that I didn't read and that aren't even in this collection. That's a lot of hype of course, but I have feeling about this guy. Maybe I'm wrong, but I heard him on NPR reading two pieces from a collection that he's working on now, and I had to stop my car to listen. This is what I heard: here, a rural man speaks to his ""boss"" an overseer of some sort--God I guess, but less remote:I drew a little line Boss / then I drew a little circle / then I spit in the dirt / and rubbed it all together / but nothing happened Boss / nothing at all so I wiped / my dirty hands on my face / and walked around bare-chested / as ever but I didn't go to the river / no I just walked around and around / the way a bird drags a bad wing Boss / and I was dragging bottom / you must have seen me there . . . .Listen to those beats humming from the simple repetition. Amazing. Anyone that writes like that deserves the benefit of the doubt."
2,it is too bad,"This album is by far one of my favorites. Some might dismiss it as lyrically and perhaps musically inferior to the Garfunkel sound. This is really quite tragic, as I see the songs on the album a perfect reflection of who and what Garfunkel stand for. I am 24 years old and was not even alive when the album was released so I cannot compare it to pop music of the time--although I never really classified Art Garfunkel as pop---more as Art Music. What I can say is that his voice, the way he chooses to use it, the songs he chooses to utilize it in, and the lyrics he expresses have touched me. He is an artist in this album in the sense that he knows himself and what he wants to say to the listener. If you are looking for the sensitive Garfunkel displaying his usual sensitive tenor voice, then this album is for you. It might even be classified as a concept album as it takes you through the journey of love."
2,Organic Shea Butter,"This stuff is heavenly and I love putting it on my lips, face, sensitive eye area, elbows, feet and any place that needs a little extra TLC. The tin is huge and will last a long time. Try it, you will love it too."
2,watch out,This product is very nice but the description said upto 7 inch and it really is 7 to 9 inch. Now I have mis matched fenders and holders.
2,Solving contradictions,"Emil Bock describes the events occurred in the life of the young Jesus, solving the inextricable problems and contradictions found by the theologians. One of these contradictions refers to the two different genealogies of Jesus. Those ones who know the level and the impact that this subject has, know what I mean. But this is not only subject approached by Emil Bock. It worths read it!"
2,Been buying this for years!,"Found this cereal quite some time ago & have never changed. We try to eat organically as much as possible & buying small boxes of cereal is just not economical for our large, hungry family. The fact that we can buy this by the case & get FREE shipping is a bonus. We try to stay away from sugar as much as possible & as none of us have a very sweet tooth this cereal is just right. It is sweetened with fruit juice & is not too sweet - you can actually taste the corn. All we add is milk. The bags are large compared to regular cereal boxes & we know our kids are getting a healthy start to the day."
2,great little cloth,Bought this for my uncle. He uses this to clean his camera's screen and the glass on his lenses without a scratch every time. In his opinion it's a must have! He loves it and received package in a good time.
2,Too Expensive,"I purchased this item for $36 three months ago ... now it is ~$58 ... WTF?Strongly recommend to wait for a ""sale"""
2,nice basic set,Bought this as a replacement set for the Calphlon Everyday set that had begun to peel after 10 years of use. I couldn't beat the quality at the sale price I got and it gave me a better variety of sizes. They can be washed in the dishwasher but it will scratch them over time. You also have to be careful about not having the heat too high so learn to be a little patient. Otherwise you'll burn food and completely discolor the finish inside the pots and pans.Compared to other more expensive pots and pans I've bought over the years I think this was a good choice.
2,Price is for a pair,"I also received double the mitts I wanted, because the price is for a pair. At this price, though, it's not really worth it to return them.This purchase was to replace a similar pair that I loved, but have worn out. The mitt I replaced had a silver hem, similar to one mitt shown in the product photos, but the 15"" I purchased did not. Overall, the new mitt seems slightly less well constructed compared to my 10-year-old pair - the ""quilting"" is larger, and the fit is not quite as tapered as the previous pair. However, the material and thickness are identical. And the price is certainly right!I spoke with customer service regarding the extra pair, and they answered the phone quickly and were very polite. My only other complaint is that it took so long to receive the mitts that I'd forgotten I'd ordered them!"
2,and the idiot award goes too. . .,"ME, for not picking this cd up sooner. i only have two words for it, ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT. i'm truly looking forward to checking out illadelph and do you want more."
2,good memory card bad service from amazon,"I bought a camera and amazon recomended this memory card saying people who bought this also bought the memory car"" or somethig like that..I paid extra to get the camera in a few days because I was leaving on vacation thinking I was going to get the disk also and you guessed it I didnt.. So I got another one at best buy. The product is a good one Amazon's failer to make it clear I wasnt going to get both items together was very disapointing.."
2,Super little phone,I replaced my Razor which had a broken hinge with this phone. At first I gave it only three stars because I had a lot of trouble getting the phone set up. It doesn't seem to be near as intuitive as the Razr. I've got most everything figured out now and I LOVE this phone. I still think the instruction book is poorly written and there a few things I don't like. Don't use the mp3 player. It's just a phone for me. Don't like that I can't program it not to go the web all the time. That button is just to easy to push. Text messaging is great and the phone feels great in your hand. Love the voice dialing. I think this phone is a great value as a phone. And the battery goes on forever. I used it all day and didn't charge it that night. I used it for most of the next day until I had a 3 hr phone conversation with a friend. After the conversation it finally needed a charge. My razr never had that kind of battery life.
2,Good coffeemaker,"I have become a coffee drinker late in life (after 40), and finally decided I needed to learn how to make it myself instead of spending too much on a cup purchased in the morning on the way to work. I wanted a maker that could do small and large pots, and have a timer so it would be ready to grab and go on the way out the door. This pot does all of that. My only quibble is that pouring the water into the tank, a little always dribbles out. It's an awkward angle to pour into evenly. That aside, I highly recommend the Cuisinart Coffeemaker."
2,Good Read,"I have to agree with most of the reviewers above who say, the book seem to be lacking something in the romance part. Although, it is full of action and worth reading. I think our expections for Mrs. Feehans books is higher than the norm. I did not feel the conection between Natalya and Vikirnoff as much as I have in some of her previous dark series characters but compared to other authors the book is really good. For Mrs. Feehan expection the book only rated A (4) to me which was good but not excellent.It is definately worth reading. Like other fans, I have high expections for the Celebration coming in September."
2,These work well. Gator girly is wrong,"It is not fair to the product or potential buyers that you blame your leaky faucet on the filter. Replace your faucet washer. It must be faulty or water could not magically get to the filter and drip.Those claiming it cracked. Maybe you hit it with a pan or something?!? Fess up. I know it takes a bit to get used to the filter being there. You now have 1 inch less clearance taking large pots, etc in and out of sink, but, without an under-sink installation, whaddaya gonna do?"
2,Keep 'em coming Brenda!,"Of the inspirational fiction books from Steeple Hill publishers, this is among the best. Friendship and unconditional love, philio and agape, are the key elements of this book. The story is unique with unexpected twists. Enjoyable read. I give this book five stars in relation to similar paperbacks. I'm ready for the next one Brenda! By the way, are you related to Barbara Coulter?"
2,Good game but a bit frustrating....,"A great game overall for every scooby-doo fan.The game is fun at first but then gets frustrating in some levels where you have to jump on platforms without falling into the water. When you do so, you need to start over at the beginning of the level....Otherwise, the graphics are superb, the sound effects are great, and there are a lot of funny moments in the game."
2,"value item, smart design","Very good price, and it has intelligently placed on/off button so it doesn't get in the way of the plugs."
2,My teeth are so happy,I have been using a Sonicare for years and I love how my teeth feel after brushing. My dentist even notices the difference.
2,Wealth of visuals,"This book by MOMA is tremendously informative and visual. Great images from drawings, renderings, models and actual building photos really enhance the viewing of this book. There is also a corresponding exhibition at the MOMA QNS from July 2004-Sept 2004."
2,Terrific -- but laptop will need Velcro!,"I got one of these at our local Sam's Club last year. I love it -- no matter how hot my laptop gets, I'm fine, and the wires go through the hole in the middle, nice bonus. But it IS a little slippery -- the fabric cover -- I solved my ""falling laptop"" problem by putting velcro on the non-printed, non-vented areas on the bottom of the laptop."
2,Good Buy,These envelopes were just what we were looking for. We have the Hallmark Card Studio 3 and these envelopes were compatable with the cards.
2,Denosyl,"I've been told by the veterinarian that this product is very good. Unfortunately, I had not have the oportunity to use it because my cat died before it arrived."
2,A True Masterpiece,"I bought this cd the other day because I decided to give Weezer a chance. I'm very glad I bought it. This album is gonna go down as being one of the most important albums in history. Everything on it is amazing. ""Say It Ain't So"" is breath taking. The lyrics are works of poetry and the guitar solo is one of the best I've ever heard; it's simple, yet the sound of it is just great. BUY THIS ALBUM! You won't regret it!"
2,Hey old skoolers REAL EVIL IS BACKKKKK,"finally something...my slayer, bathory, carcass, entombed & morbid cd's were getting worn out (again). these guys are a breath of fresh air. in a world of rage-against-the-korn-buscuit-knots and corpsegrinders, (sorry c.c.- BARNES RULES) this actually sounds cool. at first i was turned off by the name, but these guys have done good. check em' out. the band Mastodon is bad ... too. way old school. BLESSED ARE THE SICK"
2,Soviet Kitsch is a DEFINITE must-have!,"Once I listened to Soviet Kitsch by Regina Spektor, I was totally blown away. Regina's vocal ability as well as her classical piano training make this CD something to marvel at. I believe Regina brings the vocalist/pianist to an exciting new level."
2,best Dvorak,I have heard perhaps 5 or 6 versions of the Dvorak cello concerto. Of the ones I have heard this is the best (close competition from Du Pre only). The other pieces are okay but the Dvorak is the reason you would purchase this. The recording quality is especially good with the solo cello while the orchestra occasionally is not as clear. Recommended. I would have given it 5 stars if I liked the other two pieces nearly as well.
2,"Love is the Law, Love Under Will","This is the second time I've bought this book; both times from Amazon. The book has become a classic. Duquette has become one of the reigning Crowley scholars on the planet and his sense of humor is par none. One thing: I would have liked more on the ""Tzaddi is not the star"" axiom from The Book of the Law, but, the switch of XVII/The Star and IV/The Emperor can and will be debated ad nausium."
2,A life saver!,I make quite a few soups that are ham based and sometimes the ham shanks don't have as much flavor as I need. This product is amazing and has saved me more than once when the soup was just too bland. Ham concentrate is hard to find and this is amazing!
2,Kodak EasyShare C433 Review,"Very nice little cheap camera. A little cheap with the permanent memory, but otherwise very nice."
2,Great Series,"I loved this series from my childhood. I don't know for sure, but it looks like the first season included will be the colorized version. I wish they would release one box set with the first season in b&w also. Does anyone have any thoughts about this?"
2,Best 'Deth-release since Rust In Peace!,"Listen to ""Sleepwalker"", ""Play For Blood"", ""Never Walk Alone..A Call To Arms"" and ""Gears of War"" and you know what I'm talking about!"
2,great book for identifying cranial deformities,"A wonderful book for new parents. As more babies are developing head asymmetry (plagiocephaly) due to back sleeping, this book gives good pointers on identifying and addressing these asymmetries early. As the author notes, head asymmetries are not just a cosmetic issue -- they're associated with jaw pain and migranes into adulthood. It's much better to use the techniques she details on a newborn then have to resort to other methods like tummy sleeping and cranial helmets later in the first year. -- From someone who's been there and wished I had this info and awareness when my daughter was born."
2,My favorite!,"This was one of my favorite books in elementary school, and now that my children are reading it, I've rediscovered how wonderful it is! So glad my mom got it when she was teaching 4th grade in the 70' s!"
2,Les Miserables,I have seen Les Miserables twice the 25th anniversary concert brought back good memorys I would tell anybody who can't see it on stage get this video it is the net best thing
2,"Grace Kelly,Lovely Book","I did not buy this book on Amazon,but from a Library sale when I was 15,lol.I became such a huge fan of hers after I read it,at first,I did not know she was an actress,and I thought this was a fictional story! I couldn't believe this was real,marrying a Prince and you're from Philly(albeit,High Society Philidelphia,no pun intended,lol)It is a fantastic book,very fair,wonderful insights and facts.He told the complete story,and even some tidbits most Kelly fans weren't aware of.I only wish there were more pictures of this beautiful sensational woman,I still can't get enough of!"
2,A must read,"This book is a must read for every American. Chambers account of the communist activities in this country before WWII are surprisingly relevent to today and our current economic and political ""crisis"". If you want to know the meaning behind ""hope"" and ""change"", read this book."
2,Tap your hidden power to reach your toughest health goals.,"As a professional personal coach, I think that health-related goals, like losing weight or eating a more healthy diet, are the toughest goals to reach. Not only do our habits in this area track in deep grooves, but our genes often conspire against us. The daily dose of junk food advertising that constantly bombards us doesn't help either. In order to win the fight, we need a good model to work from. Dr. Casello gives us a great one. Her six stages of personal power show us which stage we typically fall into and what we can do to start achieving our goals. The book gives us insight on how we relate to food and where our power lies -- power that holds us back, or power that moves us forward. I recommend this book to all my clients who want to lose weight or be more healthy. Not surprisingly, it helps with reaching goals in other areas, too."
2,A great product,"I bought this after my cloth cover that came with my highchair became worn out after so many times through the washing machine. This cover is a great neutral color, washes incredibly easy, and has no folds or tight corners for food to get stuck in, which was a major problem with the cloth cover. Most of the time, I just wipe it down with a damp cloth after use, and it looks like new. I'm only sorry I didn't buy it sooner."
2,BE-BRATZ DOLL,"MY GRAND DAUGHTERS ARE STILL ENJOYING THIS DOLL, THEY CALL THIS DOLL COOLI HAVE BOUGHT TWO OF THIS PRODUCT. I WOULD BUY ANOTHER ONE FOR MY THIRDGRAND DAUGHTER IF SHE COULD USE THE COMPUTER."
2,Very fun movie,Just my cup of tea...a really fun musical with some great dance numbers. I loved the humor and thought the two lead performers and all the big name actors did a great job.
2,A quick reference for psychiatric emergencies,"This poket book is a quick and easy reference for pshysician in an emergency room dealing with psychiatric emergencies. The part that refers to Organic Mental Syndroms (as Delirium and Dementia) is very interesting and useful for general clinical practicers. The mental conditions are divided in alphabetical order, making it easier to search the subjects; and each one describe the diagnostic criteria and guidelines for treatment. This is really an usefull book for the physician in primary care unit."
2,Silly Nostalgic Fun,"Got this for my younger brother. It ws one of his favorites when he was little. For what it is, it's actually pretty well done. You may have similar good memories of it yourself..."
2,Success with Women - Short Money,A step in the right direction toward success with women. Well worth the short money.
2,Hilarious,"Great book gives insight to the lifestyle and philosophies within the Indian culture. The book is about one woman's experience living in India. Well written, an easy page turner."
2,"Not ""Stalingrad' but better than most","Having read a great deal of Russian history, both pre and post Revolution, I can say Beevor is a dedicated and educated historian. Fall of Berlin doesn't quite measure up to his first monumental ""Stalingrad"", but it is an honest and heartfelt work.Compared with some of the nonsense that is on the market trying to pass for good research and discipline, Beevor's book can do nothing but add to what we have learned about the Russian incursion into Berlin, and its aftermath.Some may find it slanted or overly curious about the sexual behavior of Russian troops, but who is there to say he is wrong?"
2,Dr. Dean Edell is the GREATEST!,Wonderful book...great christmas present for everyone in your family
2,Great watch & great buy!,"I love this watch! It has everything I need & the price is right. This is the second one I have owed. When my batteries went dead, I was afraid I wouldn't be able to find another one, because I went to many stores & they just didn't sale them. So I went to Amazon.com & was so happy that they had this watch.I use the alarm to remind me of the pills I have to take on a daily basis & the timer comes in handy for many different things.I highly recommend this watch."
2,Birkenstock Sandals,"These Birkenstock sandals are wonderful. Love, love, love them! I purchased this style for ""house shoes"" but can be worn outside too. They wash easily and last forever. Would definitely purchase many more Birkenstock styles but they are a little pricey."
2,radon gas test,"item worked well!!!! I sent it down to analyze it, it came back good.. I would recommend this product. All good."
2,"Small, but mighty",We were having reception problems in our kitchen with our Boze radio. Now reception is great!
2,Hillarious!,Loved this movie! This is a good movie if you like to laugh. Great for a night with friends! =)
2,doo doo brown,"doo doo brown is the only good song on this cd. although the rest of the songs suck,that song alone is well worth the purchase!!!!"
2,Agatha Christie gone Charles Osborne...not bad.,"The mystery was excellent, a classic Agatha Christie plot. A mystery where even the least likely person is suspicious and you really don't have ANY idea whom to suspect. It could be him, or her...or him, but it's probably her, no HER... The only downfall? It's not written in Christie's style. It has some classic Poirot references like ""the little gray cells"" and what not, but the writing style is obviously not hers. It's more adjectival almost...if that makes sense. But an altogether fantastic mystery."
2,no more Chlorine smell,"I'm not so sure about having softer skin or hair, but I'm pretty sure about there is no more Chlorine smell. That's good enough for me."
2,Retrospective of perspective,"A beautiful story, well told through the vision of Frank Capra. It is the story of a very typical middle-class man. He lives in the future dreaming of what his life will be, not seeing what it is. He lives for when life will become his dream. Then he is given a rare gift---a chance to see the truth of his life through the open and loving heart of his guardian angel. He then begins to understand that his true life was what was going on while waiting for his life to start. And, he gets to do this when there is still a chance to change. We all have this watershed event, albeit not all of us see it. The truth is always right in front of us, but it is very scary to see. So, like George Bailey we dream about what it should be and wait for that to happen. George opens himself to the truth and finds his true love and happiness. Would that we could all have such a wonderful life."
2,We stand stronger than time and space,More enlightening historical data to further show you how strong black people are. Two wars is definitely what these brothers fought because they had to fight White america in addition to the enemy across the ocean. This documentary features some of the surviving tuskegee airmen and they get to tell their story in their own words. To hear the history actually from the person who experienced it makes the story even more powerful. This is a great documentary and is highly recommended!!!!!!
2,R&C History For Kids Reviews,This book was surberb. It was about high-schooler Annie Lockwood and her traveling to the late 1800's. Annie always felt about out of place in the 1990's. She felt as if she were a romantic from the wrong era. Annie goes into an old manchion and gets transported into another time and place. But mystery and romance await for Annie. Can she ever travel back to her real world?
2,The best in Comedy... greatest of all Satire,Monty Python have done a truly excellent job of creating a modern and extremely funny British satire ranging across every idea in life. If you've ever though of it .. they've made fun of it. This movie rolls up all of lifes comedy into one big movie... Great job guys.
2,"Great detail, and can be fun, but","The graphics are very good. I like flying the planes with the Wii joystick, it works well for this kind of game.I don't like that I have to constantly start a mission over and over, till you finish it. It also seems that while you are banking around (turning), that the enemy planes move much faster than yours, so it can be a bit weird chasing them down.But I still gave it 4 stars. I just wish I could pick from all the missions, and maybe use a timer to see how fast I can complete them. I feel that would raise the fun factor."
2,Nice Machine - Shipping Problem,"I had a major problem when I received this unit. It would not oscillate. It is always frustrating to buy something new and it doesn't work. After giving myself time to calm down, I investigated the problem. The oscillation is affected by a metal worm gear at the base of the motor. The worm gear drives a nylon gear on a shaft 90 degrees to the motor that has two arms attached to the table that in turn control the motion of the motor up and down. Now here is the problem: The motor is not held in place during shipping. One hard impact strips the nylon gear of it's teeth were it contacts the worm gear. I called the 1-800 number provided and Delta is sending me a new nylon gear. Other than this shipping problem, I like the cast iron table and the way the machine is designed."
2,Very Sad Story-But Good,"Dearest Vicky Darling Fritz was a very interesting book and also very informative. When reading it I felt very sad for Vicky and Fritz for all the things they had to go threw, such as children who made trouble for them, a minister who did not like them, Fritz's father who would not give them the respect they diserved, and to top it off Fritz's death of cancer four months after becoming Kaiser Fredrick III."
2,very good collection,"Kashif is one of the most talented instrumentalist from back in the day and his Productions left a mark on ears as well. this collection is tight. Love changes is a big time hit. He had a distinctive vocal styling as well as a Singer. you always knew one of his cuts because the track really stood out from alot of what was happening on radio back in the day. you get the funk, soulful Grooves and a cool vibe overall on the arrangements."
2,Kaiser Pans for mini cheesecakes,Very easy to use. Pans easy to clean and dry. Perfect size for making small cheesecakes.
2,Stahlwille 3/8Flex Head Rachet,"Wow, What a perfect rachet. Its better quality then Craftsman. German engineering at its best. The rachet mechanism is very fine, like clock-work. the locking flex head helps at odd angles. The plastic handle does its job... I like it better then the mushy silicon ones."
2,The Commitment,"Although I am not married the thought of it has ran through my mind several times.. So when I came across this book I thought it could give me some insite on ""The Commitment"".. Sure enough this really shed some light for me and I'd recommend it to anyone that's thinking about getting married or even those who are married."
2,Excellent deal,Thanks for the book. It came just in time and it's in better than expected condition.
2,This little book is a must-have!,"Whether you're a seasoned pro or a fledgling writer, this little book is a must-have! It steps the reader though the writing process, start to finish, in a concise, straightforward manner. It offers suggestions for identifying and solving many writing challenges including the ""dreaded blank page."" It even warns the reader of some pitfalls to be avoided. Teaching by example, it reminds us all that the key to business writing is readability.It's sensible, smart and snappy. It fits neatly on your office bookshelf and will become, I predict, a valuable writing ally"
2,Good Acting,"The acting was very good. The plot line was also well written, not what you expect in this type of movie. They stayed away from the formula driven plots so often over used."
2,Enthusiastic about Ember,"It was so good that I wanted to read the next book the next day.I begged and begged my mom to get the next book, so we're headedfor the library.-9 year old from Oregon"
2,Another Great Barbie Movie,"We pre-ordered the movie a month ago and it arrived today! My two year old has already watched it and loves the princess' and the characters in this movie. It does seem to be geared for the older Barbie loves (5-7), because of the friendship principles that the movies is based upon. Overall a great movie and it will grow well with my daughter."
2,Enjoyable,"I enjoyed watching this first feature film of the Harry Potter Books, but I believe until the next movie the actors and actress's were more accustomed to the character they were portraying. Otherwise I enjoyed it throughly and I can't tell you how many times I took pleasure in watching The Sorcerer's Stone."
2,Pure Listening Enjoyment,"This album never made a large impact on the charts, but it really deserved more success! It is chock-full of wonderful songs, and is truly addictive! This album is a MUST HAVE for any fan of the Goo Goo Dolls or Robby Takac!"
2,Are You Are Laughing At William?,"For all of you who have said you bought this CD just to laugh at William, here is a thought for you:He is laughing right back at all of you guys...Laughing all the way to the $$$BANK$$$"
2,Always Good,Zao is one of the best real band out right now and if you like there old stuff you will love this because it has a old school hardcore bets and I love it.Zao is a band that will keep you on your toes with each song the timing on each song is perfact you could not ask for then a better band.
2,unbelievable,"a friend of mine suggested I read this book. I had no idea abot what type of book it was, but figured it must be good because my friend has never really sat down and read a book. So, I sat down for a few minutes to read ""Let That Be The Reason"" and , before I knew it, I was about half way finised.While I do not ordinarily read ""gansta"" type books, I was intrigued with ""Let That Be The Reason"" so much so that I read the sequel ""Imagine This"" the very next day."
2,"elric along with corum, hawkmoon, conan, cugel, rhialto, is insanely awesome","ok if you have not read moorcock listen upread corum swords trilogy, 6 hawkmoon books, and finish elric through book 5, then go grab all the dying earth by jack vance you canignore othe moorcock stuff as it is suspect, I personally think he got ghost writers for some of his random books and have not read his jherry cornelius booksElric in the first 5 books is some of the sickest scifi ever.You have of course read the robert E Howard conan book, the original 14 along with conan fearless, conan unconquered, and some of the other tor paperbacks are worth reading, but I love steve perry onesthen try the black company 1-3 and the silver spike by glen cookwhewThose pretty much sum up the memorable ones in 30 years I have been reading scifi."
2,Works like a charm on my PowerMac G5,"Running lots of things through it all the time: 2 firewire drives, iSight, iPod. Not a glitch. Has worked transparently just like you'd hope for. Used up all ports, so about to buy a 2d one to have a place to hook up the camcorder and M-Audio interface. Running OS X 10.4 (Tiger)"
2,Still No Walker Brothers?,"This is a small gripe. Where is one of the biggest, most recognizeable ""Wall of Sound"" soundalikes: ""The Sun Ain't Gonna Shine Anymore"" by the Walker Brothers. A small gripe since I have the song on another cd but I would have thought that it would have been included by volume 3. Probably a legal snafu. Phil Spector was truly an influential producer and a sort of svengali for many musicians in the 60's. I tip my hat to the compilers of this series."
2,Generic Econo box,"For an econo box, this little thing can blast out the hits with the power of some of the larger units. I got it just for the CD player, I listen to relaxing music when I sleep so this is just perfect for me"
2,Curve Ball,"""Mint Car"" is better at expounding on the impossibility of human happiness than anything on Pornography. What makes it effective is the ironic melodic approach. It may take five listenings, but if you like the Sturm und Drang Cure, you'll probably grow to like this."
2,Great fast charger,It's the original Nokia charger... and the only one to charge at more than 500mA... so it's fast on any Nokia phone. Get that one. Other ones that have USB circuitry only charte at 500mA.
2,perfect treasure box for a little girl,This product was exactly what I wanted for my granddaughter. It will be a gift for h er birthday and all she can talk about is a jewelry box with a ballerina on it. Perfect!

2,The best toy my son owns.,"I have had this toy since my son was 4 months, he is now 9.5 months. He was crazy about the music and all the lights when he was little. He just loves the phone and the peak-a-boo game. Now that he is standing he likes to play with it while he holds himself up. These are now his favorite songs, he rocks to them and when I sing them out and about he gets excited. A must get toy for any baby."

2,Where the Moon Suckles ... Uh ...,"Luke Sullivan defines the Modern successful white, general market adman. To wit, this book is a guideline to survive that club - and succeed within it. As a 12 year industry veteren and having met the man I recommend the book to any one who wants to enter the business on the HIGHEST level. If you are a black person, however, be wary that some of this book may seem idealised. Alas: fairy tales CAN come true ..."
2,Bambi,I have loved Bambi since I was a little child...I think that it is wonderful that we can order them and keep them and watch them over and over with our children and now grandchildren...and GoHastings never dissapoints me...I always order from them when I can...
2,Kitty's Skin Rash Gone!,"I heard about this from a dog breeder and thought I'd give it a try on my cat. He developed an all over body rash and it just kept getting worse. We couldn't even pet him. He is an indoor/outdoor kitty. (inside at night) We kept finding him outside in the ashes of our outside fireplace and just new there was something he was lacking and seriously needed. We're not big fans of a lot of the vets who want to give drugs. We tried switching his food and everything under the sun. So, I purchased this off of Amazon. Within 6 weeks of being on this his skin rash cleared up COMPLETELY! Not only that, but he LOVES the taste of it, his fur is super shiny, he finally put some weight on and he is very content to stay indoors now and doesn't have the urge to be gone days at a time. Oh, and he hasn't been in the fireplace since. If you have an animal with skin issues, this could help. I was shocked at how quickly this worked for our kitty!"
2,Great Saber,"This is one of the best lightsabers you can buy. It is great for detail and looks just like the saber in the film ""Attack of the Clones"". Anakin is the best character I belive in EP II. The clear blue blade is a great improvement from the EP I sabers. I was hoping that i could somehow remove the blade, like you can with the EP I Darth Maul Saber. The sounds could of been different as they are the same as the EP I sounds which were not great. I like the feel of the saber as you swing it. Overall this is a hard to find product so buy it if you see it."
2,Waited too long to pick this up,"Even though I've always been a fan of Elaine Cunningham I had resisted the urge to pick up this series. Not sure why but, I should have read it ages ago! Fun story with compelling ""human"" characters. The setting was new for me which was also a treat!Highly recommended!"
2,Good story about a GREAT LADY,"The story-telling style of this book made ""the reader"" jump around in time -- rather than giving me a chronological unfolding of Dorothy's life day by day. My personal preference is a chronological report of how things happened, but I enjoyed reading this book. Having grown up in northern MN, I've always known the ""legend"" of the woman who lived without running water in the BWCA, but this book introduced me to the incredible pioneer spirit of the Root Beer Lady."
2,kitty crack!,The product arrived in great condition. As I set the can on the table my 4 month old was going nuts over the can! He head butts the can and although it has only been a few day I am positive he knows what the can looks like and that it is kept in the fridge. His older counter part doesn't go AS crazy but she loves it to! She like to try to eat it and roll around in it. Overall I am happy the cats LOVE this stuff it really does seem to be the best. I highly advise to buy this organic as cats eat it and I'm not a fan of pumping too many chemicals into their little bodies. Trying to post pictures :o)
2,Karen,"Gave this bag as a gift to my son's girlfriend, as she is beginning student teaching- and she went crazy!She has 2 dachsies at home so she is a total ""weiner dog"" nut! Her grade school students love it as well.It is a great conversation piece!!"

I LOVE THIS STORY CUZ ONE OF MY FRIEND HAD A SAME SITUATION LIKE THIS. AND THIS BOOK WAS REMAIN ME WHAT WAS HAPPEND TO MY FRIEND.....THE AUTHOR WAS GREAT!!! WE ALL LOVE THIS BOOK.. THANK YOU 4 THE AUTHOR..."
2,User Friendly,"This code scanner is very easy to use. The instructions were short, to the point and got me up and running in 10 minutes."
2,Nice Illustrations,"The strength of this book is the illustrations. Great style, I think, very nice colors and pictures. The writing is adequate. My 3 y.o. loves it. I am very happy with the purchase."
2,Great for bedtime,"With wonderful illustrations, rhythm, and rhyme, this is a perfect picture book for bedtime, counting, and fun.Do yourself a favor and buy it for you little one."
2,Review from a layman,"If you are just getting your feet wet in ontology then this book will be very challenging and often frustrating. As you slowly become accustomed to the terminology and basic ontological concepts, the book becomes more and more readable and enjoyable. If you ever felt you were all alone in your existential dilemmas, then this book will provide great comfort. Everything is here in this book if you are willing to take the time. Contrary to an earlier review, this book makes perfect sence and every concept is backed up with logical analysis. Sartre is very good about providing clear and concise examples to all of his concepts. This is not a philosphical treatise on ethics so it is hard to understand why an earlier review labeled it as dogmatic (that person must be referring to a different work by Sartre). A dogma based on nothingness is hardly any kind of dogma."
2,rare cd,"Nice early rock/blues album with a cover song of howlin' Wolf's ""Howlin' For My Darlin"" and John Lee Hooker's ""I'm Goin' Upstairs."" The sound quality on this album is very good, and surprising for an early live album.8/2/04 Item is being sold on ebay."
2,The Dark Side of Twilight,"I know the author of this book personally and what she went through to write it. She is a wonderful person and a great author. The book is very vivid in detail. The Dark Side of Twilight should be read by every woman and man. I have loaned my own personal copy to several friends and family members. In turn, they bought a copy. It is a must read. We should all give great thanks to women like Jean, who actually experienced this and did tell the story. Thank you, Jean."
2,A Second Grader's Review,I think this book is terrific! My favorite part of the book is when John gets the chocolate touch. The worst part is when John kisses his mother and she turns into chocolate. Will everything get back to normal in the end? The Chocolate Touch teaches a lesson about why you should not by greedy.Julia
2,Crime he is not better known,"This is one of my favorite Buckethead cd's. This man can play. If you are a fan of great guitar players, check this out. Not sure who I could compare his style to...maybe Jeff Beck? In any case, this is good stuff...check it out."
2,"The Glass Warrior (Demon Crown Trilogy, Book 1)",I read this book 11 years ago and it has stuck with me all of these years. The characters are well planned and leave the reader wanting more. It is well worth the read and gears you up for an outstanding adventure. The characters are heroic and tragic without being steeped in misery like some other fantasy characters like Thomas Covenant or Tanis of Dragonlance fame. The book gives the reader enough information without giving all the answers and lays a excellent grounwork for a second and third book. The only drawback was the lack of information and the unfortunate loss of one of the main characters (read to find out which one) and is a satisfying read.
2,HOTEL CALIFONIA,"GREAT CD LOVE IT, UNFORGETTABLE SONGS. MUST BUY CD. REALLY HAS SEVERAL GREAT SONG ON IT."
2,Amazing!,"I am a HUGE Doctor Who fan and when I saw this I had to have it! Shipping was amazingly fast to ship this item from London to Honolulu and the quality is exquisite! I highly recommend ordering from this company. I am very pleased and all I have to say is ""Exterminate!"" :)"
2,Best rechargeable batteries that I've found,I love rayovac rechargeable batteries. You can't beat a battery that fully charges in 15 minutes and holds it's charge for a considerable time. I had the Energizer rechargables before these and they don't compare. It takes the Energizer batteries almost 8 hours for a full charge and they don't hold a charge as long as the rayovac rechargeables.
2,love this CD,"I used it in the hospital for the birth of my second child. Its that uplifting, magical, transporting and inspiring. Now I use it in the nursery for naptimes."
2,Unfortunate package deal.,"I subscribed to the Season 7, unfortunately this is not part of that package. This package only includes the holiday specials going backwards in time.Story is ok. The resolution is a bit hokey, but probably more in the spirit of the holiday instead of the series."
2,Still Relevant,"Burt Lancaster spent many years trying to capture an Oscar, and finally did with his portrayal here as a fiery if not terribly sincere evangelist. Jean Simmons is very convincing in her role as the evangelist who Elmer falls for, and who eventually falls for him. It's fun seeing Shirley Jones playing against type as a hooker, and winning an Oscar for it as well. The climactic fire sequence is awesome."
2,Great tires for the price but there are cheaper tires!,I ordered these tires for my dolly after I went to tractor supply and noticed they wanted $35 just for one tire. Only complaint I had was they took a while to come in but once they did they slipped right on with no problem. I didn't notice until after I had ordered the tires that harbor freight had the exact same tires for like $5 a piece and I wouldn't have had to pay the shipping or waited forever for them to come in but otherwise I am completely satisfied with this product.
2,not as good as the movie,If you saw the movie first you maybe dissappointed in the book. The main character Tessa never appears in the first person. However it is a great story.
2,juice glasses,"This is just what I was looking for, just the right size and nice heavy glass. My husband and I drink juice every morning and these are perfect!"
2,Between the Woods and the Water,"This is the continuation of, ""A Time of Gifts."" The English youth continues his walk across Europe to Constantinople. He picks up now in Austria, on to Hungary following the Danube valley. I wanted to quit reading this - page after page of allusions to east European history from Roman and pre-Roman times, Hungarian geography, reflections on Slavic languages. Esoterics I cannot appreciate. Still, they lured me and challenged me. These are places and these are people - Magyars and Gypsies - we seldom find in writing. We are introduced just as an era is about to end and everything is to change. It can be a book to go to bed with."
2,I still haven't found what a wookie's for.,"It's a Chewbacca alright, except this one has a chain. One of the best chained wookies Hasbro has ever made, but it's still just Chewbacca as he was on Tatooine in Return of the Jedi. The sculpt is nice and he's sturdy. As a bonus, you can pretend he's a high class designer dog on a leash for your Paris Hilton doll. Don't worry, Billy: You'll get your wookie back once your sister makes Paris find another pet-du-jour!"
2,A diverse bold collection,"The paintings of Ilene Meyer are boldly coloured, with chequered floors often as soft fluid waves. Most contain the traditional elements found in still life such as flowers and fruit or portraiture and landscape painting, however with a twist. Whilst the vase may be filled with flowers as you would expect, it may sit in a slightly altered almost sci-fi world.Meyer has some fantastic creatures, my favourite being the Llamiger (cross between a Llama and a Tiger) ad the Zebrocerous (yes, Rhino and Zebra together).I also love the medusa paintings for her coloured hair, almost ribbon like but with little creatures hidden within.This book is neary all pictures with a brief introduction and preface, so if you are expecting commentary then you would be disappointed.As the ""search inside this book"" function was unavailable, I found pictures of Meyer's work on the internet using an image search prior to purchase.If you like her artwork, this a fine collection."
2,&quot;BRILLIANT! CAN'T GO WRONG WITH THIS SHOOTER GAME.&quot;,"Socom2 is Top Notch! Online Gameplay is Superb! Very addicting when playing online. Graphics on this baby is sweet, even better when playing online. I don't care what some of ya'll say about how bad this game is and giving it a single star! (it's probably because you get killed more times then vise versa! Newb!)This is a must buy!"
2,A practical discussion of widowhood,"Drawing from her own personal experience, Betty Jane Wylie gives the reader an inside view of what it is like to be widowed at middle age. Although dour at times, this book is mainly filled with practial advice for the newly widowed. Information is given on finance and employment, relationships with friends and children, companionship and sex, travel, household repairs, etc.This book is unique, in that it is not a detached, academic look at the grieving process. Wylie's personal anger and pain at her loss are evident. Although this book is depressing to read at times, it also seems realistic and practical."
2,Fox really dropped the ball on this one....,"This has got to be the wittiest show in my lifetime. I was gutted when Evil Fox Network canceled this show. They never even gave it a chance. It is cleverly written, brilliantly acted, and bloody fantastic. I participated in the 'Save Wonderfalls' campaign and it is great to see all our hard work paid off. The DVD was released yesterday and I haven't been able to tear myself away from it ever since. In fact, I took the entire day off work just to watch the entire series. Okay, that is a lie. But I would recommend this series to anyone who is sharp-tongued and slightly cynical. Snarky is as snarky does."
2,One of the BEST DreamWorks Movies,DreamWorks was able to pull it self back up a second time after the release of Kung Fu Panda. MegaMind is a brilliantly made movie with a great story and a great message tailored for people of all ages. I will not ruin the movie but its a definite MUST see and a keeper for ones collection.
2,Just to clear things up,"Well, this is a brilliant EP, with two really good covers. I recommend this cd to any whigs fan, but as Radiohead fan as well, i feel i should say: it is not Creep by Radiohead. It is Creep by TLC, which is quite different. I doubt a true Whigs fan would be really dissapointed, cause the song rocks either way, but just to prevent misleads."
2,An appropriate end to a great series.,"While the conclusion may seem a bit rushed, every important character's intentions are explained sufficiently, most importantly those of Enkidou, the Countess, and Tatsumari - the most puzzling and mysterious characters in the series. The origin of the Gilgamesh is revealed, and we finally get to see the Professor (and his gang) duke it out with Tatsumari and Tatsuya (and their gangs). What's not to like?I feel like this disc fits well with the mood of the whole series, and the tragic conclusion is an indication that the Japanese understand that not everything turns out all warm and fuzzy in the end, and generally things are more interesting when they go wrong. Besides, the series wasn't written for sentimental Americans, but rather for a Japanese audience which tends to appreciate depravity and tragedy.Really, what else can we expect from a show that starts the 7-disc series with the title ""Orphans of the Apocalypse""?"
2,best stuff for keeping your face shine free,"I have tried all types of oil control products. Some were very expensive. This product is handsdown the best! I teach all day in a non air conditioned room and this kept my face ""t-zone""nice and non oily-looking. It works all day."
2,Gurnall better than current titles on Spiritual Warfare.,"John Newton, who wrote the famous hymn Amazing Grace, said that Gurnall's original volume would be the one book he would want in addition to his Bible. Bell's devotional edition captures some of the best illustations and insights of Gurnall in a way that is enoyable and that will introduce you to the writings of this great Puritan Pastor. His understanding on Spiritual warfare is soundly Biblical and contrary to a lot of current titles that purport to be Biblical but are based on experience. Gurnall will Bless You!"
2,BRITNEY ROCKS!,"This is the European Regular Edition, the Special Edition has including ""Don't Hang Up"", well, this CD maxi is just amazing i love it!"
2,it is awesome...,"I have never had any formal exercise regimen before (nor done any reviews)but feel compelled to write this review. have had it for a week, i do feel the sculpting going on...as chalene says..it is what you put into it that makes the difference...so if you put more effort, you will definitely see the results"
2,Nice job,"When I saw Phantom of the Opera on the shelf. I instantly purchased it and read it... This book is absolutley magnificent. The illustrations are beautiful they show a sense of class and sophistication.. I was very fond of the Series itself (Great Illustreated Classics) I own 61 of those series, and I have no complaint about them they are very fun to read when your angry, sad, happy. or just bored. Great Illustreated Classics are a wonderful source of books for chilldren easy to read and quick, so you can read 3 a day. ( I read about 5), And they are worth every penny I have so go out there and buy yourself some great Illustrated classics. thank you"
2,Very good.,"These are very good and not expensive.You buy these at Staples and they charge $5 more.I agree that a public exchange is needed. If anyone knows of one, can you please post that information here. We'll all appreciate it!Anybody want to trade the extras?"
2,Great Powerful Songs,"This album has elements from their old style along with elements from their newer ""electronica"" stuff. This album seems more serious than their lighthearted ""Presto"" and ""Hold Your Fire"" albums. ""Roll The Bones"" lead us into this album with the style that was about to come for this and ""Test For Echo"".The opening song ""Animate"" has such a cool groove sound that it's 6 minute length seems much shorter. ""Nobody's Hero"", one of Rush's most personal songs yet has great lyrics. ""Cold Fire"", probably my favorite on the album is a nice song on the subject of relationships. I highly recommend this CD."
2,Awesome absorbency!,Great quality and absorbs sweat amazingly during my hot yoga practise! It stays put on my mat and I LOVE it!
2,Durable and Reliable,"This is an excellent way to split your socket up. With their being plugs on the sides it helps to direct your wiring in the direction you need it to go. It looks very sharp on the wall so you dont need to worry about trying to hide it next to a couch or anything. The adapter simple screws in over the existing faceplate and you are all set to go. Anyone can set it up! If you need more than two plugs, go with this. You wont regret it!"
2,"Great backup battery, but limited use as air pump","This is a great backup battery and love the ""portable outlet"" feature of it. The jumper cables are a great idea but I luckily haven't needed to use that yet. The flashlight has come in handy as well. I found the air compressor to be too weak for much value unfortunately, but it might be OK in a pinch.In practice I use this more for portable power camping and such then for emergencies.I do wish that they had a USB outlet or better yet a mini USB charger cable build right in to power USB powered devices. I also wish the air compressor had a bit more power."
2,Pie Crust Shield,The Mrs Anderson's Pie Crust Shield works great. Tired of using pieces of foil to cover the crust. Just pop the shield on top of your pie and you don't have to worry about the crust browning before the pie is done.
2,Just like Manson...only not,"There's nothing much original about ""felons and revolutionaries."" Dope's sound is ripped straight from ""Antichrist Superstar."" The black-on-black American flag on the cover is a joke, and dope's whole image seems a bit phony. Even their retooling of Dead or Alive's ""You Spin Me 'Round"" is reminiscent of Orgy's cover of ""Blue Monday."" But who says originality and honesty is important in the new millennium? ""Felons..."" is noisy, obnoxious, vulgar... the perfect thing to blast at work to piss off your boss and your co-workers. Dope rocks, that's all that matters. Best tracks: ""Everything Sucks"" and ""F**k the Police."""
2,Lip Reading Made Easy,"The book was published over 100 years ago, but I found it helpful. It presented categories of shapes formed by the mouth to create various sounds. Each category was accompanied by a drawing showing the mouth in that shape. I found the book helpful."
2,Wonderful!,The Lectures on Faith are an integral part of the LDS teachings. I try to read them at least each year or so and they definitely are building blocks to my faith.
2,Good camera have used it for 3 years,"This is a very good camera, unfortunately Fuji has stopped production of this model... it is very good for starters to learn about photography and slowly move towards a DSLR mode i guess...i have used this camera for last three years and now i have a broken battery lid.. which is due to th eplastic body.. i feel this is the only drawback this camera has other wise this is really a good handy camera...."
2,Oster Clippers,"The set of clippers work really well, were shipped promptly and were very well priced."
2,The King of The Crooners,"The new king has been crowned!!!! What a fantastic voice, it gave me shivers. He is without a doubt the most incredible performer, singer, and entertainer to arrive in 20 years. We all bow to our new king. May he reign forever. This c.d. is worth every penny. I highly recommend it to everyone of all ages. I am only 26 and enjoy every song on this c.d."
2,My baby loves this (but it does eat batteries),"When my husband picked out this mobile I thought it looked like a scary acid trip! I wanted the soothing soft and fuzzy one that matched our baby's room. But I agreed to give it a try and I'm so glad I did. From the minute she saw it, our two-month- old kicked and laughed and loved it! She's now 3 1/2 months and now she babbles at it and follows all the movement with her eyes. It does eat batteries, but that's a small price to pay. I haven't had any trouble with it breaking (maybe we just got lucky)."
2,okay movie,this movie was great except it was very long. the acting in semi decent and the effect are good for its time. i think a remake would be lovely. i also think that some different faces would be good.
2,Excellent Value,Great deal for the money. Dragon Speaking worked better then I expected. I wish they included Quattro Pro.
2,5 Stars? - What else is a Greatest Hits supposed to be?,"There's nothing really here to review - it's obviously Seger's choice of what his best songs are and, for the casual listener, should be an essential purchase. Although, I would have to say, he appears to have made a 'commercial decision' with this package and has ommitted those songs that made him what he is, that is, Beautiful Loser, Katmandu, Get Out of Denver and several other earlier recordings that could have generated interest in his life before 'Night Moves.'Point of interest: Seger once said he would never issue a greatest hits package."
2,A good time for some good advice.,"Some may call me old fashioned but I just think my values may be more strict than kids these days are usd to. When i was a child my family sat down and ate dinner together evry single night of the week. My parents are what people now a days would call old fashioned, but to me thay were right. Do not get me wrong I am not saying that everyone should conform to the old ways but maybe with Dr. Phils help we can get back to all of the things that were so good and healthy about those cleaner times. His book came out in just the nick of time."
2,An excellent windbreaker!,"This does the job as a first-class windbreaker and rain jacket . . . and it's excellent for the price. There is not much protection from cold, but this is a good choice if you're looking for rain and storm protection in spring or fall weather."
2,Warning: Excellent Book,"I am a 5th grader and I really enjoyed this book. The main character, Yolanda, is about my age, and she is very smart and sophisticated. She cares about her family and even though she makes mistakes sometimes, she is a nice person. I really liked this book and think that other kids my age will like it because they will be able to relate to Yolanda and her family. Carol Fenner is a really good writer."
2,Slayer of Sacred Cows,"Well, here is the real literary tabasco sauce, with a sprinkle of Darwin, Twain and Nietzche thrown in for good measure. Mencken was America's greatest prose stylist, and an amateur musician, Nietzche translater and gadfly to boot. To read his prose is sheer joy, and this is the place to begin."
2,Cool and brilliant,"Such a fantastic blender. Simple but powerful and effective. And it looks extremely cool on the counter top. I love how the jug is glass (although you get two other attachments as well) and just slots in rather than needing to be screwed on. I also love how it can be disassembled for washing. Just perfect, so happy with this purchase."
2,First Album Is Perfect!,Britney Spears first album is perfect. Why? Because she was just starting out in the pop world. She was just a teenager and the songs went well with her image at that time of the release. I really enjoy her vocals because her voice is pleasing to the hear even though some say her voice was changed and dubbed by a machine. All four singles that were released from this album show cased that she no one hit wonder.
2,MG Ex-S,"This gundam is huge, easily towering my other MGs and is almost the same height as some of my PGs (while it's on its stand) Oh yes, it does come with a stand, as it cannot stand on it's own two feet (this is because it wasn't meant to fight on land, only in space) It can convert to a vehicle mode, but I like to keep mine as a robot. Not much ways you can pose this guy, but it is very detailed and looks very nice."
2,Undertow,I have read a number of Lorena McCourtney's books and find them very entertaining. The book was a very good read and I had trouble putting it down until I had finished it.
2,The Last King of Scotland,The Last King of Scotland is a excellent movie. Everyone should see it. Great acting & very informative. I have seen this movie a number of times & enjoy it more each time I see it.
2,A great Story,I have read this book several times.Some might think it isn't a kinda sexy book. But it is very!Buy it read it you'll love it.
2,Heavy Rotation Album,"I bought this cd after borrowing a friend's copy for about four months. He finally demanded back his rightful property, so I hurried out and got it for myself. Bragg succeeds in making this album catchy, fun and heartrending all at the same time."
2,Just take the parts you want,"Good book, I use it all the time as a reference. Whenever I'm ready to try a something new, to explore an alternative, I grab the book (which my wife stores in the cleaning closet). The ingredients are safe (bonus) and cheap (bonus). I especially like the cost saving analysis. The names for everything get a bit over the top. Some alternatives can be more than you want (she doesn't believe in vacume cleaners for example), but just take what you want/need from the book."
2,Savage Socks It to the Self Righteous,This unrepentant libertine gives Dan Savage two thumbs up for telling it just like it is. I enjoyed this book immensely. Thanks.
2,A Soothing Ambient Album,"""Driftwood"" is an album written, produced, recorded and played by Rena Jones. Her work has resulted in delightfully soothing, relaxing instrumental music - slow music for fast times, indeed. I found the best cuts to be in the middle, such as ""Photosynthesis,"" ""Driftwood"" and ""Open Me Slowly,"" but all songs seemed to be polished and produced to bring out the mental image of the music flowing over me. ""Driftwood"" is a delightful weaving of orchestral instuments into electronica, resulting in a wonderful ambient album."
2,Great book,"Definitely should be one that people purchase. I bring it with me every where I go, sometimes modifying the ingredients but over all i like how it tailors to specific health conditions."
2,Better than expected!,Very impressed with looks and function of shelves. The Directv install man asked where to get them while installing in the guest bedroom. Only clitch I had(there is always something) I may have overthought the install directions at first. But wen I followed them install was a snap.
2,I Can't Imagine Life Without It,"I am a veracious reader...books, magazines, newspapers...you name it. The Kindle has uncluttered my life 100 fold. No more fighting with the newspaper on the subway...I just turn the Kindle on and there is my morning newspaper. I've cancelled all of my newspaper and magazine subscriptions....no more clutter in my mailbox! I can even get my favorite German newspaper everyday on the Kindle....what a treat is that! No more having to go to a bookstore to buy a stack of books...I just pick from the terrific selection at the Kindle Store and one minute later I can start reading away...no matter where I am. Even though I have had the Kindle for barely a month I can't imagine what life was like without it. I have absolutely nothing negative to say about the Kindle. I also purchased the light that goes with it...I love that too...I can read anywhere...even when there is no light. I love the Kindle...enough said!"
2,Brother XL5500 easy to use,"I had this machine up and running in about 10 minutes. If you've sewed before its super simple. Runs fast and makes nice stitching. This machine is good for anyone, especially a beginner."
2,A very useable video for a new mother,"I love the way that this video is broken into 4 segments. It makes it possible for me to excercize regularly without feeling bad that I can not do an entire tape at one time.The music gets annoying, but the excercizes themselves have really made a difference to the way my body looks! I am really glad that I bought this video!"
2,Awesome!,"This tiny little book is extremely helpful, even for experienced writers. It covers topics including the writing process, style, research, and practicalities, such as diction.One of my English professors had us read through this book. I found it well suited to educational use and I still have it a year later because it's just as good for personal use."
2,ridiculous!!!!!,"this DVD is so nasty!!!! Mudvayne is so damn good and they show you in this DVD...This is the most talented band around these days and every performance in this DVD is flawless, every song is so crisp and sharp its like your right there .....I freaked out and punched my TV...... and a bunch of other things in the room....if you were here I'd punch you too ...I recommend you watch this with someone so you can have someone to punch"
2,Farmer says,"I bought this toy for my granddaughter that is 20 mo. old. It is the perfect size for her hands, easy to use and she can handle it quite well. She loves the 2 songs it plays. It is easy to carry around. Lots of different animals, more than just the usual. Glad I bought it."
2,Great For Embroidery Designs!,"After purchasing my embroidery machine in 2004, I read information regarding downloading designs from my computer. Everything I read said to use SanDisk Compact Flash Cards and that's what I have been using for the past 12 years.With SanDisk, I have NEVER lost any of my 100 embroidery designs (that's the amount my embroidery machine will recognize on each card). Over the years, I have accumulated over 2600 designs, which means I have purchased 27 flash cards (I have an empty one to fill for when I need it). SanDisk is the best flash card I have ever used!"
2,A rare treat!!,I too have been serching forever for the CD version. I have the vinyl version. Had to search hard and long for that too. Love the SOS band but I have to agree that this is their best. Wish they wouldre-release it. There would be a lot of happy folks including me.Please oh please re-release it.
2,Great shirt!!! Good Quality! Shipped and received Quickly!,"We needed a fun shirt for my boyfriend's 42nd Vegas/Blackjack Bday party and this was sent with ample time to get embroidered. Quality shirt! Nice heft to fabric and well constructed. Very happy with the product, seller and whole transaction!"
2,Very fun from 4+ months,"This was a hit with my first child and will be soon brought out of storage for my second. It has lots of things to keep kids engaged and continues to hold their interest for a long time. I only gave it 4 stars, however, because it is HUGE."
2,Memories,"Absolutely loved the book. As a graduate of the ""home"" a couple of years before Purenut, I can remember a lot of the same scenarios. My sons and I were talking about the book (one of them bought it for me for Christmas) and I told them that if I were a writer my story would have been the same. Thanks for the memories."
2,Why Cats Do That: A Collection of Curious Kitty Quirks,"I bought this book for someone turning 7 who had just got a cat. This little gem of a book helped explain all of the quirky behaviors that cats possess. While the text may be just a bit advanced for someone that age, reading it with a grownup would help to explain some of the more difficult words or concepts. The illustrations, which are pencil sketches, are charming and so very cat like. This is just a neat little book that can actually explain why cats do what they do. A must for any cat lover. And not just for children. Adults will find it fascinating too."
2,Skeptic?,"He remains on top of the fantasy charts for me. This book really kept great pace, and it was an amazing story, with an amazing character! Look out Drizzt! The cover is enough to make you want to read it, but the first few pages makes you wanting more! I had a very hard time putting this down, not being a very big reader myself, I found this very characteric of many of Salvatore's novels. He writes combat wonderfully, and this only complements the wonderful characters. Truly a great achievement! No Demonwar knowledge need be present, but I'm sure your going to want to read, as I do, what the present Demonwar novels are about."
2,Useful Tool,"The Inventor's Notebook is a useful tool for someone wanting to invent and patent a new idea. Understand that it is just a tool, and you will still need professional advice if you are going through the patent process. However, this is definitely a good place to start."
2,2 Thumbs Up,This is the first pair of headphones I ever purchased and they sound so much better than those that come free with walkman or cd player. I can sincerely hear a lot more detail that I did not even know they exist before. $30 AR is well-adjusted for the quality of sound.
2,A good gift for a boy with a Bearded Dragon!,I bought this book used for my nephew who has a bearded dragen.The dragen got sick and there was some good advice in the book. This was a few years ago and the dragon is still doing well.
2,Excellent,Excellent wires for a good price. I had them for a couple years and no problems so far. Highly recommended.
2,McDisney,"Inside the Magic Kingdom is a great book when read just to get information about why Disney does what it does with its company and theme parks from the standpoint of customer service.The real power, as I see it, of this book come from seeing that, like McDonalds, Disney has discovered how to apply a customer service attitude across all areas of their business operations. Moreover, these principles are not proprietary and can be learned and applied by anyone seeking to improve his or her company's (or personal) customer service strategy.Read the book and apply the lessons and don't get too hung up on the dialogue of things."
2,Great Book but not a day traders book,CANSLIM is wonerfull if you are a long term investor. I got confused in how he explains market direction. Definetly for the longer term investor.
2,"""Blue"" CD","I just love my CD ""Blue"" by Leeann Rimes. Sorry it took so long to send a review. I wanted to play the CD first to make sure it worked and then I totally forgot about sending the review. It came is the condition it was promised and I am really enjoying it. Thanks!"
2,I guess I am the best reviewer of this album since...,"...since I've listened to it when it was released in 1984. The best Stranglers album ever? maybe, at lest the one with the best songs. There are some low points, too, I really hate Mad Hatter, No Mercy and Spain. The best ones, no doubt are Let Me Down Easy, Laughing and Souls. The first two are A major while Souls is in D minor. Their atmosphere is intense in sophistication, balance, rhythm and a 100 percent brilliant harmony. I don't think this is a pop album, besides, I could say it stimulates some sort of childhood sensibility. I recommend to slow down a bit a half-tone these 3 tunes (also including Skin Deep) to understand and taste them better. North Winds is also an excellent tune, the darkest of the album. Ice Queen is an excellent intro. Uptown and Punch and Judy go hand in hand. I don't say this album is perfect, but I gave it 5 stars since it's one of my best favorites of all time."
2,ISAIAH 9:10 Judgement,The book is very good. It's a real page turner. Once you start reading it is hard to put it down for too long.
2,Suede Gloves,Exactly if not more than what we expected. Outstanding value. Confident it will pass the test of time.
2,I am ME,"I was very much looking forward to this CD, I did like her last album, She sounds much better on this album. I new side of Simpson comes out ..My Favorite songs are -Boyfriend, LOVE, Catch Me When I Fall, I AM ME and Say Goodbye.Least favorite song on the Album is Burning Up"
2,"Finally, some information I could use!","My husband and I love this book. After reading Baby Wise (hated it), the Baby Whisperer (it was okay...still refer to it from time to time),Lullaby Sleep Plan and researching sleep training for hours on the internet this book finally seemed to make sense. It's basically offers an understanding of your babies sleep capabilities (developmentally) for different ages. I strongly recommend reading this one before the baby arrives and then refer to it as your baby matures. This book does not offer quick fix solutions nor does it push one method or the other...mainly it provides insight about how to help your baby avoid sleep problems by giving a good start on learning to sleep to the best of his/her age readiness. Really love this book and it has really helped us solve some basic sleep problems in our now 4 month old. Definitely worth the money and time!"
2,Durable and Clean,"I have been using my Eheim 2213 for 19 years now, and have never had to replace any parts, until now. It is an incredible filter, that keeps everything in the tank clear and fresh. The only complaint I have has already been fixed. The double shutoff connections that they've added will make cleaning it so much easier. 19 years ago, they didn't have these, but I may buy some extras. I've heard that the only downfall for Eheim is ordering replacement parts. The only thing needing replacement is the suction cups that hold the parts in place inside of the tank. Everything else is wonderful!I would definitely recommend this to others. Especially with a good price for a canister filter."
2,polished chandelier,This maxim lighting chandelier was shipped quick and packed perfect. The chandelier itself is beautiful and the polished brass shines like a mirror. This product gets 5 stars in my book. The price was also right.
2,A Spirited Journey,"A simple yet well executed story about a High School Snr Football-star's journey into maturity and encounter with an Indian former player ""Spirit"" guide as Jason Wiles character Greg Sima(covicts son)adjust's to the constant upheavel and relocating by mother Sally Cima(Margot Kidder/Superman) to follow Dad's prison transfers and the toll it take's on the whole family. Only with gradual understanding and training by Spirit(Russell Means/Under A Killing Moon)do both characters acheive their personal goals and gain meaning from it's teaching's. Almost like a disney movie of the week tale but very likeable and almost touch of ""Karate Kid"" echo's to the film.Solid performances allround, good score and beautiful cinematography of Utah landscape. Value viewing entertainment, hard to believe this movie is 10yrs old still holds up to today."
2,Excellent live effort,"I originally purchased the LP in 1987 as one of my first Le Orme recordings. This is a very solid performance of Le Orme standards, but without a doubt the show stopper is the intensely percussive ""Truck of Fire"". A must have for any prog fan!"
2,MUSICAL PHENOMONA,"This is probably among the most best band of today, or at LEAST lyrically, they are miles ahead of many musicians today, Standing is extremely emotive, beautiful, the lyrics are great throughout this whole CD, heck all the melody on this cd, along with his voice, is all outstanding, it's sad that this cd or Futureperfect isn't on the Rolling Stones 500 greatest cd's of all time, especailly considering some of the cd's they have on it that don't even compare with VNV"
2,Very pleased!!!,"The book arrived as stated and in the condition that I expected, and was sold to me at a good price. I was very pleased and would certainly purchase again. Thank you for a pleasant experience!"
2,very eccentric music,"their music is pretty funky and offbeat. i think it's fresh with beats and tunes that many have not heard before. it's the kind of music that you listen to while you're high or on mushrooms, as it extracts this dazed and altere-conscious emotion from you."
2,Tortilla press,"I love my new tortilla press. We have not bought tortilla's from the store since this arrived. It is so simple and fun, within a half an hour we have fresh, hot tortilla's anytime."
2,"Mack R. Mathews 111,M.D.","Very helpful for anyone involved in a love one with schizophrenia. The author walks the walk, not just talk the talk. Great read. 110 on a 1 to 100 scale."
2,Great bag when you don't want want to haul it all,"This review is for the Lowepro Topload Zoom 1. This is a great little bag for times when you don't want to haul your entire inventory of gear. It is the perfect size for my Nikon D80 with the 18-200mm VR zoom lens mounted. There is just enough room on the left side of the camera to tuck in the camera strap. The pouch on the front is just right for a few filters and an extra battery. An especially nice design touch is the way the top of the bag flips outward, away from your body, so you easily see into and access the contents of the bag."
2,"Better than ""Goodnight Moon"" in many regards.","Now that I have your attention, do not misconstrue this to mean ""Goodnight Moon"" is not a great book (it is) or that the simple near-rhymes aren't wonderful (they are) or that the illustrations are somehow deficient (by no means).Rather, I considered two factors. One, this book has a narrative thread: it has a beginning, a middle, and an end. It's the next step beyond recounting a list of items in a room and then wishing them a goodnight. Two, my son Ethan loves this book above all others. That's the single most important factor to me.It has pretending in it, some minor adventure, and hidden gems if you care to find them (especially if you notice the tie between all three in the series). Overall, an underrated followup to the classic that hasn't been overlooked in our home.-Fred"
2,"A brilliant, honest, superbly written analysis of Hollywood","I'm a two-time Oscar winning songwriter (""The Morning After"" and ""We May Never Love Like This gain"") so I have considerable knowledge of the film industry and how it works. Lynda Obst has written an amazingly concise, witty, penetrating study of Hollywood. Her candor is refreshing and her advice invaluable. Aside from the gems of information she passes along, she writes in a clear, articulate, graceful style. I've re-read ""Hello He Lied"" three times, and plan to comb through it again for more insights from an extraordinarily gifted individual."
2,To be a child again!,"Ah, nostalgia! A friend of my older sister gave me this book when I was, well, nevermind. It was 45 years ago, and I have never forgotten the story of the kids who built the flying machine and went to the other side of the moon. A magical tale and I am thrilled to see it republished."
2,still refer to this occasionally,"I've considered myself pagan for 9 years now and dip back into Positive Magic once in a while for a reminder. It was one of my earlier books introducing me to magick and I wish I had found it sooner, could have saved me from some dumb mistakes. The how magick works and what to avoid sections are very helpful to a beginner. Certainly it shouldn't be the only pagan book to rely on, but if you don't have any teachers or pagan contacts yet, this book will feel like a good friend. As for her dislike of Crowley, I don't _quite_ share it, at least I don't think he's that scary, after all I have his Tarot deck. However, I would never recommend one of his books to a beginner!"
2,Great Book,"This book has non-stop action. It moves in a fast paced way though the different parts of Zack's life as he deals with sports, relationships, and the hate crime. I never found myself bored while reading and the first person point of view was very interesting to read. Zack was very brave and it was interesting to go on his adventures. The characters reacted in a very beleivible way and seemed very real. The ending was a happy one and there is a good twist at the end."
2,A German Enigma That Contemplates Mortality And Loneliness,"Although haunting and enigmatic are overused and trite terms often used in movie review hyperbole, sometimes they really fit to aptly describe a film. While 2006's ""House of the Sleeping Beauties"" was largely dismissed by critical consensus upon its release, I nevertheless found this to be a fascinating and frustrating contemplation of mortality and loneliness. The German film has an intriguing premise and, in truth, the plot may leave you a bit perplexed as it is only explored in the vaguest of terms. But still, there is something dark and truthful in the lead performance that brings more depth to the character development than to the bizarre narrative. And, for me, that made the film worthwhile."
2,Love it!,"Can't say enough good about this brush, a first I didn't like the brushing, I'm 16, and a fussy cat, and my mom was bad with brushing me, besides I didn't like it. I have very long hair. But I love to be brushed now, and my mom doesn't have to pick up all my hair every where. Less shedding, and I'm beautiful now!!"
2,Amazing album,"Perfect album which i have been listening for more than 6 years! It is indeed a masterpiece, and wish they would launch another one some time again soon!Namaste!"
2,It does the job,"the only draw back is it has a pop in plastic washer on the arm that connect to the back of my tracker and there is no place for it to snap in, so I did not tighten the nut too tight or it would smash the nipple of the washer."
2,Life is like a box of chocolates....,"Thescore for Gump is a sweeping instrumental score with inspiring woodwinds, synth. and piano. The ONLY downfall is the Jeasus on the main line song...it just does not fit in there what-so-ever. But still, the score is 100% a keeper!"
2,the best wallyball out there (that I have tried),"This ball is awesome. It is the most durable, has a good texture, and the texture on the ball last longer than any other. The multi color may scare you away at first (it is what kept me from trying it for so long). But once you try it you will love it. It makes it easy to see the ball, as well as easy to see the degree of rotation on the ball. It does not get a lump in it as often as others when a frustrated teammate kicks it HARD with a toe. As a note lumps develop in rubber balls from internal bruises, these usually don't cause a lump for 24 hours. The only con is it is usually $19.99. Whereas other balls are usually 16.99 on sale. Trust me it will at the least last long enough to save you the cost of two of the other balls."
2,Reasonably Good,"Though this is not one of Gene Kelly's best movies, it certianly is quite good. The dance numbers aren't that great, even though they are well done. The exception is ""Why Am I So Gone About That Gal?"", which is both beautiful and red hot! The plot is a bit complicated, but it is very compelling. A must see for any Gene Kelly fan."
2,Good product...just kinda hard to use at first,"I found this unit to work very well...I love the digital answering machine. At first, it seemed much more difficult that any ordinary cordless phone. My suggestion is to read the instruction manual before setting up ANYTHING...it makes things much easier. Other than that, everything works fine and I am very happy with the purchase!!"
2,Stirring and Sympathetic.,"A strong narrative of the heroism of Roman Catholics trying to practice their faith in Jacobean England. Unfortunately, the Gunpowder Plot did nothing but hurt their cause. Still, they were very brave men who died horribly for their God. As a Shakespeare buff, it is intriguing to know how many of the plotters came from Shakespeare's home area, Warwickshire and Oxfordshire, and how he must have known some or even most of them. The Plot, together with Shakespeare's desire to flatter James I, helped inspire Macbeth. (Macbeth can be read, in part, as Shakespeare's attempt to distance himself from the plotters). Several of Shakespeare's relatives died for their Catcholic faith. This book provides insight into the Roman Catholic community of the day, the treacherous political skills of the Cecils, and the mixture of pigheadedness and glory that seems to constitute human bravery."
2,Great Classic Moovie,"Always a movie i wanted,great action ,always liked Martin Sheen .Classic Movie with great actors who are now ledgens.will watch over n over"
2,Arguably Schulze's most timeless effort...,"When this album came out it was viewed as a unique tour de force of music. Schulze, Michael Shrieve (of Santana) and Wolfgang Tidpold (on cello) playing nearly 40 minutes of highly rhythmic, droning music. But unlike a lot of space music or prog rock of the time, there was almost no melody or chord changes or even consistent rhythm here. Just a lot of hypnotic, trance-like, sequencer like, machine like (though almost entirely hand played) music.Now, over 20 years later, it sounds as amazingly unique as it did back then. Unlike much other music by Schulze in this vein that didn't have the same energy, or his older efforts which sound much more dated, this album has a certain timeless quality to it.I can't guarantee that if you buy it you'll love it. But I can guarantee that if you buy it you won't listen to it and have to take yourself back to 1985."
2,Very comfortable,I used this item almost every week since I bought it. It is very comfortable and the grating sizes are very common sense.
2,Superb example of how even a genius is human.,"The book is one of the best biographies of Feynman, it motivated me to find out more about this great man of science. I was really drawn to the human side of Feynman. I was a bit disappointed that the book ended with what seemed to be a cursory look at his later years. I would have liked to learn more about his outlook on life, science, religion, etc in the latter part of his career. I enjoyed the book immensely"
2,Handy item,"Does just what it's supposed to do--adds a little extra security to my pocket/clip-on pedometer. Comfortable clip and nice ""leash"" length."
2,Ouch!,"I'm not a gym rat but a serious at home exercise enthusiast...She is serious! The best thing about this workout was something Jillian said and it is true... ""If you only want to work out for 20 minutes a day and see results, you have to work hard"" or something to that extent. She is right and she makes you work hard. But the great thing is it IS only 20 minutes and you are done for the day with great results."
2,Getting There,"This book points out how Shania got to where she is and the difficultly that she had. All the book has is quotes from newspapers and articles. I feel the author could have dug deeper to find out Shania information. The author should have tried to talk to those who where behind the scences with Shania or anyone who was involved with her. This would have given the reader NEW facts! Even though, I feel anything that tells you about Shania is GREAT. I love everything on Shania so I cant' say that it is that bad."
2,must have,these earring are beautiful and go great with the necklace. if you like celtic than these are a must have.
2,Corelli and Tebaldi toghether,"If you like Corelli, don't hesitate to get this. If you like Tebaldi, don't hesitate to get this. If you like both of them, then of course don't hesitate to get this. This is a glimpse at two legends on stage together. Past their prime? Yes. But even at that there is enough left over for some really beautiful sounds. Just listen to Corelli in ""O bell'occhi di fata"" or ""Sogno soave"" how he caresses the words. The sound is noisy but it quiets down when the singing starts and is quite listenable.Don't listen to the other reviewer. He is obviously not a fan.I gave it 4 stars because of the noisy sound."
2,Vinyl sounds so good!!,"I am so happy to have this! Great price, great condition, and I love the way vinyl sounds. Nothing against the clarity of CD's, but this seems more ""real"" to me. The product was exactly as described, and I would do business with the seller again, given the opportunity."
2,Easy Solutions,"As a mom of two children under two who are still in diapers, I like how the advice given in the book requires minimal effort that will make a maximum difference in my pocketbook!"
2,Thought-provoking,"This is an amazing book about Post-War Germany and the guilt of the ""second generation."" It starts as a love story, but ends as a thought-provoking tradegy. Well written as well."
2,Aller-C,"I started taking Aller-C upon the recommendation of my doctor, who suggested I try *this* first, before I go the regular *drug* way (like Claritin, Allegra, etc).It works - needs a little bit tweaking still, but my allergy symptoms are much, much less. I definitely would recommend it!"
2,COOL GAME!,"Zoo tycoon is a really fun game. It lets you take care of your own zoo and they even have really cool animals like bigfoot, or a yeti. It keeps you ocupied for hours and hours and it is definitly worth the money."
2,"Good solid lock, easily reprogrammed.","Hi security lock, solid. Was easy to install, as dead bolts go. Retrofitted an old key lock that kept getting left open."
2,The Best CD ever.,"This is hands down my favorite cd. I can relate to so many songs, and I do not know where all of the negative feedback for this cd came from. Even if you don't like Weezer, get this cd anyway. From Tired of Sex to Butterfly you will thank yourself for spending the money."
2,I never give reviews!,"As mentioned in the title, I never give reviews. However, I feel like it is necessary to give high marks to this product as it is working wonders on my indoor herb garden. Though my herbs were doing okay with indirect sunlight, they have now exploded with the use of this bulb. My mint plant has had enormous gains along with my coffee tree and lemon thyme. All other herbs have made gains, as well.Great product!Pat"
2,Real Men,"If you love stories of the old West, this book is a must read!George Laycock does a nice job of giving us a good overview of this time period in our Western History. The book tells much about those days of trapping and exploring when the West was an unknown and unmapped area. In addition to telling the stories of several individual characters like John Colter, Jim Bridger, Hugh Glass, Jeidiah Smith and others, the author takes time to explain the fur trapping business. There are several sections in the book explaining weapons, traps, boats, clothing, tools, etc. The result is that the reader gets a good insight into what these men did and how they did it. The one drawback might be that some of the character studies are a bit short, often leaving the reader wanting more information. However, for a general overview of an important time in our early history, this is a wonderful book. I'd like to see this as required reading in our schools."
2,the ice cream paddle that works,Easy to hold. Works well at scooping even stiff (very cold) ice cream. Good for a lifetime. My first one is 20 years old and still going strong. I recently decided to move up a size and I like this bigger one even more.
2,"To the 1 star people, ya some odd things but it shows all that is human","Yes, there is instances of sex, nudity, masturbation, violence, etc; But there is also talk of change, acceptance, growth, joy, sorrow, and much more.This movie shows everything that we as humans are, both the good and the bad and how we can and have grown from it. It is a beautiful and meaningful movie which everyone should watch more than once (the first time just to see the story, second time to understand it).To the people who give it one star, the ones who all say its all about sex, etc, come on! Look deeper, stop pointing out only what you want to see! If we didn't have our bad side we would never appreciate, well, anything, not our best friends, our family, God, life, or a simple flower from the one you love to cheer you up, negativity allows us to have all of those things and so much more and that is one of the few messages of this movie."
2,I think this is a great book!,This book is about King Arthur needing horses strong enough to fit his knights. I recommend you read this book. This story will leave you on the edge of your seat.
2,Mobilos foster creativity,"I was a pre-school teacher and bought mobilos for my class. The children loved them. They were able to create all sorts of moveable things from transformer-like figures to all sorts of vehicles. I bought a set for my 3 year old grandson and he loved it so much, that I bought an additional set for him recently. The children can really use their imagination with this. The connectors are a little stiff at first and they might need some help snapping them on initially, but they do loosen up.This is an excellent product."
2,Lovely color,Very pretty color. Just right for me. I'm glad I chose it. The shipper had good prices and fast shipping. I'd surely buy from her again.
2,Fun gift,Ordered this button for stocking stuffer for adult children. It was the favorite gift of the year.
2,Required Reading for DJ's,"This handbook leads you step by etep into the world of pro DJ's. Follow every word and you can't miss making your business into the power leader in your area. I worked the pages and now I have quit my job and do this fulltime very successfully. Thanks a billion, Stacey!"
2,A fascinating family and all the games we grew up with,"I finished reading the Game Makers at 2:00 a.m. Usually I am sleeping long beforehand, but I found it just fascinating to learn about this amazing family and their great company-- especially because of the the way the story is told. It is filled with real drama and surprise. It made it difficult to stop reading before the last page. I learned a lot about making games as well. I also understand much better now the relations between the principles of successful business and the rules of games. The incredible changes in the last 25 years were of great interest for me. The amount of details presented is astonishing and the way they are presented makes it a pleasure to read.I applaud this highly original and interesting book."
2,Plenty of energy,"One nitwit wrote that there was no energy. What? What planet were you on? I saw them early in their tour in San Diego, and I was blown away by the power and emotion. Lindsey was a wildman he had so much energy!"
2,another vote for a re-print campaign,It's an awesome soundtrack and simply cannot be found. Here's to the power of capitalism. $
2,One feature sets it apart,"All quarter sheet sanders are relatively similar, however, this one removes one of the small inconviences of the machines. It has a very easy to use quick sandpaper change mechanism. All of the other sanders work as advertised and all require a little bit of fiddling to bend the sandpaper in a small arc to insert into the clamping mechanism. Now along comes the Bosch 1297DK and that small complaint disappears. It also has a slightly better dust collection system, though, no sander short of using a vacuum hose is really going to have great dust collection. I'm replacing my DeWalt quarter sheet sander with this one and am very happy with the upgrade."
2,1 Real Issue with this one,"Nice mouse. I'd repeat all the positive notes about this one, except to say that there is one issue that drives me nuts.The middle-mouse button is really unusable.1. It requires far more pressure than necessary to press2. Pressing it triggers either the scroll left button, the scroll right button, or the the wheel in some direction.You can fix this by sacrificing the usability of one of the scroll left/right buttons (whichever you prefer) and map it (using the provided SetPoint software - which isn't so bad) to be the new middle-click. I don't touch the original middle-mouse button and I use the scroll [left] button almost as much as I use left-click."
2,excellent book,"This is a really interesting book. It has some photographs (which have inspired me to get out to Cape May and other cool birding havens) but most of the pictures are black & white drawings. The detail I think is actually pretty good. The drawings do not give specific detail of color shading etc but instead provide the broader strokes of major markings or wing shape or how the bird might look looking down at you. There are head-on profiles (in different modes of flight), some top down drawings, but mostly looking up and side. The raptors are segmented into the different groups of Buteos, Accipters Falcons, Kites, Northern Harrier, Eagles & Vultures, and Osprey. Within each section each bird has a few pages with pictures and really neat info about their migration patterns as well as tips for id.I'm still not very good at id of these birds but I love watching them and trying to id them. This book is a really good resource!"
2,"Sturdy, works well.","The arm is sturdy and works well. It'd be nice if it had some sort of cable tray, but perhaps that would have made it unacceptably thick (the TV sits an inch or two off the wall when the arm is folded flat.) When folded flat, the TV is not centered on the bracket, so the bracket is a little assymetric when extended."
2,"After two years, still a bedtime favorite...",Our four year old twins still routinely choose this one from the bookshelf for their nightly story. Read it so much that the cover is getting quite worn.The abridged nature of the classic disney stories keeps them interested but allows me read it to completion without falling asleep. A great balance.Great classic addition to the toddler's home library.
2,Please ignore this review,"..because I will say nothing new except that I think I'm in love with Steve Sandvoss who played Aaron Davis, the missionary man.Steve is quite marvelous in the movie, and I do hope he is as ernest as he is in the movie as he is in real life.Yes, you may rate this review unhelpful."
2,Cute,Paris/ Neo Japan brace yourselves. Tommy and his friends are finding a mom for Chucky. Hopefully you have a playpen big enough for these adorable tots and their less than ideal manners!
2,Another Great Andy Williams Christmas Album,"Each holiday season anymore, Andy Williams leaves his theater in Branson and visits America to sing his pop hits and many of the songs featured on his classic ""red"" Christmas album and this, his ""green"" album. It is another fine collection of songs, featuring ""My Favorite Things,"" ""Sleigh Ride,"" and a version of ""Do You Hear What I Hear?"" bested only by its original singer, Bing Crosby. Andy Williams would record probably too many Christmas albums after his ""red"" and ""green,"" but these are the best."
2,Not much to say except...,"This is one of those essential albums that you would need to have if you were stranded on a desert island. It still sounds as great as it did back in the 70's when I first owned it. Aja made a huge impression on me back then and shaped my musical taste and sensibilities for years to come. If there were more than 5 stars to give, I would rate it as such."
2,Not just for Cellists,"This book is an excellent and precise treatment of the Alexander Technique. Although his examples are primarily for Cellists, Pianists, and singers, there's much that would apply to any musician. Occasionally academic, this book is well worth the patience. A moderate number of pictures are present."
2,Spellbinding,This book was a wonderful read. It shows the reader how the decisions we make in life can affect the rest of our lives and the lives of those around us.
2,Back Plaster--A great thing for pain,"People know very little about this product, because it isn't advertised and is rarely seen in pharmacies, but it is a great product to have on hand for muscle pain. I have used it, to good effect. My family has always been aware of this product, and kept some on hand for use.The beauty of it is that it can be cut down to size, so as not to waste and to tailor-make it to the sore area.To use it is simple. make sure the area where you are putting the plaster is clean, dry, and has no lotions. Estimate the size you need, and cut.Peel away the plastic lining(just as you do with Band-Aids) and press gently to your skin. You may leave it there until the next day, but remove it before you shower.That's it. No dosing, so smells. And, for me, it works.I hope this review will help others when they look at this product here on Amazon. Thanks for your time in reading this review."
2,"Pushes lots of air, makes lots of noise","Rather than spell out pros and cons, I'll just call them all ""observations,"" since one person's noisy fan is another person's white noise heaven. Anyway, here are my observations after having owned one of these fans for over a year:1) It moves a lot of air for its size;2) It has three speeds, the slowest being quite breezy and the fastest being only marginally faster than the slowest (in my opinion, Honeywell could've done without the middle setting altogether, or slowed down the slowest setting more);3) This fan puts out a lot of white noise, even on its slowest setting -- I would compare its slowest setting to the white noise of a box fan on medium;4) I used this fan unsuccessfully in an office environment (too noisy because I couldn't put the fan more than five feet away from my desk) but successfully in a home environment (white noise puts my wife to sleep while still moving quite a bit of air from 10 feet away from our bed)"
2,So cool!,"In case you aren't familiar with this book, it is about a caterpillar who eats and eats and eats. The board book version has holes in the pages so the reader can see what he has eaten. It is so cute! The illustrations are adorable and the kids love it! We are a bilingual family so my boys have the Spansih version. It's super and very durable!"
2,great buy!!!,I got this for my nephew who is 1 and he loved the music and lights...but the 2 1/2 yr old sister loved it as well and more interested in the animals that went on the train and what it was saying....GREAT BUY and lots of fun for toddlers...I would recommend it to moms for sure!!!
2,thank you - great extra from seller,thank youi had been wanting that video for yearsthank you for the bonus
2,Janis Ian at her Best,"I have treasured this album since it was released in 1978. This eponymous set features Janis Ian's best piano playing and some of her most heart wrenching lyrics. The singing and harmonies are outstanding as well.The achingly beautiful Hopper Painting and Do You Wanna Dance stand out as slow, moving pieces that show the writer poignantly reaching out but perhaps not expecting to find her love match. Silly Habits is perhaps her best jazz song and That Grand Illusion should have been an Adult Contemporary hit. I Need To Live Alone Again may be the saddest song in her repertoire, but coming from Janis, the pain seems so real, yet we can believe in her strength to overcome heartache and continue delivering powerful, gorgeous music.I'm so glad to find that this is finally on CD at a reasonable price (though I paid a fair share more for the handwritten lyrics to a couple of these songs when she held a charity auction in tribute to her mother in 1998)."
2,"Clever Arrangements, Haunting Vocals","This is an album not to miss. It's a creative mix of covers with very hip arrangements allowing Dave's technology to be tempered by the warm humanity of Barbara's voice. If I had to knock it, I'd say it didn't have enough rough edges, yet Eight Miles High is a brilliant rethinking of the Byrds' classic. This and others have a way of staying with you, and you'll find yourself humming, if not singing along outright."
2,"Great Roy Rogers & Smiley Burnette film,songs,music,action","I enjoyed the interaction of the two actors, and Roy playing a duel role was interesting/well done. I appreciate watching Smiley play the different instruments and doing a duet with Roy. Film was well staged and enjoyable. The film had enough action and the musical interludes were placed well, flowed with the action instead of being thrown in."
2,Fun At The Race Track,"In SHADOW OF THE THIN MAN Nick starts out to clear one of his reporter friends who has been accused of murder. The killing is actually the work of the syndicate and is connected to racetrack gambling.William Powell and Myrna Loy return in the starring roles and they are supported by another large cast which includes Barry Nelson, Sam Levene, Donna Reed and Stella Adler. Dickie Hall appears as Nick Charles, Jr. who is now old enough to talk.W.S. Van Dyke serves as director for the last time in the series since he died before the next entry was filmed in 1944. Van Dyke will be remembered for his direction of Nelson Eddy and Jeanette MacDonald in ROSE-MARIE and NAUGHTY MARIETTA."
2,Excellent Product!,"I love this Finger Saddle! It really does improve the way that I hold my flute. I have really long, skinny fingers that make it hard sometimes to keep a firm grip on my flute while playing harder pieces and this makes it easier and more comfortable to play my favorite pieces."
2,Very Interesting Movie,"I got this movie for my girlfriend who is a big fan of Gerard Butler. She had seen it before, but I had not. I was pleasantly surprised by this movie, and found it to be a very nice story."
2,"Brilliant, but not for Everyone","If you are only interested in the girl who ""just wants to have fun"", buy She's So Unusual or 12 Deadly Cyns. You probably won't like this CD if you are expecting that kind of music. If, on the other hand, you recognize that there is depth behind Cyndi's persona and can listen to this CD with an open mind, you may really, really like this CD. I think it's just stunning -especially after seeing Cyndi perform the music from this CD live. It's mostly a quiet CD. Most of the songs have sparse arrangements, sometimes just a piano and cyndi. The CD is supposed to showcase Cyndi's vocal abilities and I believe it does. Cyndi is never one to imitate, so although these songs are covers, many of them sound nothing like the original. Her cover of ""Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood"" gives me chills. Before this, I wouldn't believe that anyone could improve a Nina Simone song. It takes an open mind to really enjoy this CD."
2,Handy guide to French wines,"If you are looking for a really comprehensive book on French wines, this isn't it. But, for its size and price, it should be ideal for anyone wanting to buy all sorts of wine - or to visit France (there are very useful maps)."
2,I can't stop playing this CD,"I wish radio stations would play something this extraordinary. I got turned on to this CD from my son, who's a 28 year old attorney. I am from the Dylan generation. And David Gray is able to cross all those lines and more and at the same time establish himself as a new presence in music. He's simply great, and I have listened to and loved all of the great singer-songwirters of the last half of the 20th century. He's perhaps the first great one of the 21st."
2,one of the best,"I have had this video for 10 plus years and I still ""feel the burn"" when I complete it. This workout is killer. Susan Harris is in great shape. A little too perfect at times, but she is very motivating. Tjis workout has everything, aerobics and toning exercises that are effective and safe when performed correctly. Don't try to use weights your first time. Take it slowly and you WILL see results."
2,Love this series,"I bought this book because we wore the first copy out. ROFLWonderful characters, inventive situations and great writing. Some of the best writers in SciFi are represented in this series. It is CLASSIC."
2,As good as Brooks Brothers's at a fraction of the cost,"What did we do when men's shoes had leather soles and cost $100 or more? We slipped and fell on our butts on wet steps; we were constantly reminded of soldiers, marching in step; and we wondered why a consumer product so universally required had to be so damned expensive. No more. These cap toe oxfords are as beautiful as any $250 shoe I used to ogle in Brooks Brothers's Philadelphia store on Chestnut Street, and they're many times more comfortable, provided as they are with cushioned rubber soles (looking identical to the leathers, I might add) and interiors. I wore them to a job interview not 100 yards from that Brooks Brothers store the day after they arrived and walked with a spring in my step I hadn't felt in decades. An absolutely terrific shoe at a great price!"
2,This is a great video for big ladies,"I love this video, it's great. If you're very out of shape and just starting out in low impact aerobics after a few years break, it's very good. If it seems a little tame for you then just put some of your own moves in or work a little harder/faster and it'll be all you need."
2,Great Performances,"Both actresses give their all in this bio. Judy Davis' performance is mesmerizing and at times with the right camera angles, you would swear it's really Judy Garland. Her body movements and mannerisms, speaking voice... all are right on the money. The story hovers a bit much on Luft, but that's to be expected as Lorna wrote the book this is based on. Almost devoid of Liza's own story, she's just suddenly not there. I'm sure there was some drama surrounding that departure! I saw this first on TV and wanted to have a copy to watch without commercials. Very enjoyable."
2,Only if you play high-level campaigns....,"If you take your campaigns into the upper reaches of immortality in mortal form, this is the book for you. MANY more skills and other interesting abilities that make any character (except the psionicist--an oversight) into a very formidable character. Also includes entire chapters devoted to helping a DM run those campaigns without unbalancing or simply adding tougher ""super"" opponents. If you retire your characters around 9th to 11th level, however, you need this book like a hole in the head. It is definitely a question of campaign style and player tastes."
2,A tight thriller,"By about page 20 or so you know that there is going to be a major confrontation between Garth Frick and Sam Wintripp. These two don't like each other and through out the book we witness Frick steadily lose control and Wintripp decide to do something very violent in response.THE BLACK SILENT starts out with the bad guys holding all the cards and the good guys playing catch up.There are plenty of action sequences, daring escapes and the steady revelation as to why Frick is so desperate.There is a good balance between action and intrigue, and it is this balance that keeps you turning pages."
2,the Deftones still have it,"this is the 3rd album from this sacramento band. Well i can tell you that this is the best one ,but i don't know, it's still good, but if you like this one you'll sure gonna love the other two. and if you are thinking that chino lost his screaming and relly cool lyrics (like jon... you know who), well you'r wrong, his still got it as well as the other band members. you should really get this cd for yor ""new-metal"" collection befor somebody else do."
2,Good and True,"I purchased this product because I have a few dead laptops with good disk drives. The price was cheap and there were a few bad reviews. I bought one and tested it. I was satisfied enough to buy 3 more. The only negative is that it comes from Hong Kong and I had to wait 3 weeks. The upside is that the shipping is free. Give it a try. It is worth the risk of getting a bad one. If it doesn't work, contact Amazon and they will make you whole."
2,Lovely,Beautiful ring! Fits perfectly & goes great with the other band I bought from Gem. Will definitely buy from again!!!
2,Don't try with Olympus DP12 and 256 MB xD card!,"First, the vendor ([...]) gave very prompt service with good packaging and prompt delivery.I recently ""inherited"" an Olympus DP12 microscope camera which refused to function without a Smartmedia[sic!!!!] card. Since I had a 256 MB xD card on hand, why not get this adaptor?1. The ""adaptor"" portion sticks out. Yes, although the device fits in the Smartmedia Card slot in the DP12, its ""butt"" sticks out so the door of the card compartment won't close. So I had to ""shim"" the door-actuated switch with a wooden applicator stick.2. The card is rejected by the DP12, I'm guessing, because the xD has 256 MB.I gave up and bought a 128 MB Smartmedia Card on e**y, which works with the DP12!"
2,"i remember this as a boy. it's very imaginary, lots added that's not in the Bible, but not far fetched","quite atmospheric, quite nice. not accurate, but pleasing. it's very imaginary, lots added that's not in the Bible, but not far fetched"
2,Good buy,"ASP.NET Distributed Data Applications, is an excellent book for learning ASP.NET database programming. At the moment I am on chapter 8 all the examples which I downloaded from wrox, all work. The book is very detailed with many methods and ideas of contructing a database web application. its not a book for beginners. A person with good basic asp.net or vb.net knowledge will get most from this book. Excellent buy and worth the money."
2,Be gone Mosquitos!!!,"We live on 1/2 acre w/2 pools behind our house, so I purched the Flowtron Octenol Mosquito Attractant Cartridges for the Flowtron 80-Watt. This unit has performed wonderfully! Our family was tired of spraying w/a mosquito repellent just to go outside even for a brief moment w/out being swarmed by mosquitos so this was just what we needed. Best purchase for some relief. Higly Remommended!!"
2,Discontinued.............,This was my favorite Facial Hydrating Cream & used it for years but Olay no longer offers this particular product.
2,Great Jazz Arragements for All Levels,"This book of arrangements make a nice addition to any Pop/Jazz collection. The difficulty of the pieces in this book range from a high beginner level to a mid intermediate level of difficulty. The pieces retain their original melody, but the underlying chords are altered at different intensities from song to song. The popularity of the tunes makes them fun to both practice and present to others."
2,An Encyclopedia of the Tibetan Tiger Rug,Four and a half stars.Mimi Lipton has done the rug community a great service in putting together this wonderful volume. It is in no way a definitive work as the rugs took on many different forms (see for example the Bernheimer Tiger rug offered for sale at the famous Christies auction in 1996) and there are some repetition of subtypes. Nevertheless it is quite an amazing book and makes a good contribution to the literature on oriental rugs.Many cultures of the East valued the pelt of the tiger. But leave it to the Tibetans to come up with a compassionate and ecologically wise solution to the demand of these prized skins.This also makes for a great coffee table book.Recommended.
2,Kleypas at her best!!!!!!,"I have read just about every Lisa Kleypas book that I can get my hands on....I have just one thing to say...GIRLS GET THIS BOOK!!!!! Sara is so likeable...and Derek...dont even get me started!!! He is soooooo delicious!!!! If you are looking for an emotional,entertaining, steamy read....look no further..this is it!!!!"
2,Very Happy with the Seat,Very happy. Our child sits up high and can see out the window better. Straps still get a little tangled. Overall I am VERY happy though.
2,Confessions of a cutter,"I cut myself. I don't want to, it just sorta happens that way. Anyways, I haven't had any finger shavings in any of my food since buying these, so that's worth 5 stars to me!"
2,a classic bowl of soup.mmm.mmm.good,"...still tasty after all these years! I love this album & I've listened to it so many times & still can go a year or so without listening to it,put it on & hear something there I never heard before. It's that good! Miss me some Blind Melon with Shannon Hoon."
2,Does The Job,This is a basic HDMI to HDMI cable that does what it is supposed to do. Nothing more and nothing less.
2,Good for the price,"This sound card, its the best you can find at this price. The driver can be better, but its ok. With pro tools M-powered it work just like any Mbox, 002 or 003 rack but with 2 input only. I really think its a great interface."
2,Sherlock Holmes meets Frankenstein,"In this 1939 film, Boris Karloff makes his last appearance as the Frankenstein monster and Basil Rathbone gives a wonderful performance as the next ""mad scientist"" who gets caught up in the mayhem. The story, music and sets work quite well. Bela Lugosi is quite good as Igor and this is the last film in the series that really stands on its own. Much of the ""Inspector"" was later spoofed in ""Young Frankenstein"" generations later. Lionel Atwill gave a wonderful performance in this role as well as many others for the ""classic monsters"" series Universal films. The print and sound quality of the VHS release was good. This film was also released on Laserdisc, but I wasn't able to get a copy. Hopefully, it will find its way to DVD in the very near future. The film appears to be quite well preserved. This seems to be true of nearly all of the Universal ""monster"" films I have seen."
2,Daisy doesn't disappoint,"I have loved every one of the Daisy Dalyrymple series and this one is no exception. Daisy goes to her old roommate Lucy Fotheringay's wedding and stumbles into more trouble. Her husband, CID Alec Fletcher, is around to help her out. This series is delightfully cozy and set in the twenties it doesn't have the language or graphic gore so many mysteries do. This is a light breezy read that will keep you entertained."
2,This is Classic George! Truly a brilliant album!,"Having largely ignored most of George Harrison's ouput except ""All Things Must Pass"" and ""Cloud Nine"" and the occasional song, it is great to hear such a moving and timeless mix of songs. This is an album out-of-time, one which could be enjoyed by any age and during any era. Even without being a religious or even spiritual person, I enjoy the 'at ease' vocals that give me a sense that all is well in the world. Mixed with spirit, clever and classic lyrics, and George's comforting vocals. George, always being my favorite Beatle, continues to be awe inspiring and a talented and cherished treasure that will be enjoyed for decades to come. This album is simply beautiful, only such an immense musical career could put out such an album...thank you."
2,A Classic,"The closest comparison to The Lord of the Flies is probably Animal Farm. I think the Lord of the Flies is better then Animal Farm (also a classic) because the lord of the Flies can be an Allegory to several different things. Among them are: What people behave like in groups, how childred act without proper supervision, how people act in desperate situations etc. It could be studied in a Sociology class just as easily as in an English class.A real eye opener"
2,Dinoco400,I think that the Sherbert Bunny is really cute. I have 12 webkinz already and I would love to be able to find the Sherbert Bunny at a good price.
2,"This is a one great movie,what can I say, it's hallarious!=)","I watched this movie everyday when I was a kid!!! I loved it! I still do!! It is one of my favorite movies. I love ""Fred"" and I love his other friends that are also ""immagonary""! I wish that I could have had a ""friend"" like ""Fred"" or ""Namsi Pambsi"" when I was a kid!!! Rosy"
2,The new Daft Punk,"This is the new daft punk! Every song is superbly produced and has it's own sound. Listen to especially to spanish harlem and illogique. Spanish harlem sounds like minimal techno (Robert Hood) but rocks every dancefloor. On the other hand, illogique sounds like Kraftwerk in the 21st century!"
2,The War,"I rented this first of all for Kevin Costner, but was surprised after watching why you never heard more about this movie, It was fantastic! Every actor and actress did great jobs, but both Elijah Wood and Kevin Costner stood out. It never really had a certain plot but yet it did in the fact that it focused on war from three sides....The real war Costner went through....The war the children fought to try and fit in.....and the war that everyone of us fight inside ourselves. If you don't walk away from this movie with a twing inside something is missing. I would highly recommend this for the whole family to watch and learn from. And yes I cried at the end."
2,Should have gone larger,This works exactly as it should. I should have done the math before buying. The place I'm using this is really too large for this model. Will probably order another one to assist in heating the area.
2,it actually works,"I've tried just about everything to stop my nail biting habit. My mother even threatened to put gloves on me that I would have to wear 24/7. I'm 27 now, and hopefully am out of the habit without relapse. This product works since it's a bitter reminder that I'm biting my nails. The only pit fall is that finger foods (ie fruit, chips) also taste bitter."
2,Emotionally rivetting!,"This collection of stories is a trip into the ""real"" India, into the heart of an average Indian woman, and the journey she has to undertake--all in silence. Divakaruni provides graphic details, metaphoric images, and soul-wrenching words to weave tales and tales of those sacrificial, silent women we have known all our lives as mother, daughter, wife ......"
2,Great computer game if your child is a Dora fan,A friend told me about this game and my daugther loves it. We got it for her when she was 3 1/2 and it still is her favorite computer game (she is 4 now). I recommend it for kids who like Dora.
2,moisture lotion,"This is a very nice light moisture lotion. It is not sticky and has a nice, silky feel. I have used it for years, but I can't seem to find it in stores anymore.I will never order it or anything else from AMERICAN WHOLESALE again. There packaging is very poor. They mailed it in 2 separate padded manila envelopes. One was not sealed when I received it and the box the bottle comes in that was sent in one envelope was crumpled. When I complained they sent me one more bottle. I only received two out of the three bottles that I ordered. I don't understand why they couldn't send all three bottles together in one properly packaged box."
2,Great Cookbook,I got this cookbook long time ago as a used book that was falling apart. The cover and some of the pages are missing but I still use it to get my favorite recipes out of. I was looking for a waffle recipe and converted her griddle cake recipe which made a wonderful waffle that everyone is always asking for. This is a great cookbook.
2,good for the price,"This is a really decent tent for the price I paid. It is kind of small, just big enough for my gear, and me but if you'd leave your bags outside, 2 people will fit. It is extremely easy to set up after you figure it out. I put it up once before taking it camping and after that first try, I was able to pitch it by myself in about 5 minutes. However I have only taken it camping for one weekend, and the weather was perfect, so I'm not sure how it stands up to harsher conditions. Overall it is a good buy."
2,Great Classics,Just a great funny classic that was made the way comedy could for all ages. I bought all the series from Amazon and have enjoyed them all
2,Great upgrade!,This should be the first upgrade you do to all your cars.Hands down the best performance filter for everyday drivers.Buy it once wash instead of replace.Life is good.Better for the enviroment in that sense.
2,Works fine,"The pad could be longer for me. I'm a big boy and could use about 4 more inches on thepad. But it works fine. It's a sling, it holds the rifle or shotgun on your shoulder.And it's comfortable. What else do you want out of it."
2,Hpmicide,A look inside a homicide unit. The dedicated. The absurd of what happens and how the investigators cope with the stress of the streets. A great read.
2,Very good Book,This book is written in a interview floor mat of people who own the pits and its wonderful. Good information for all dog owners. It also has stories of owners and the photos and art works are fantastic.
2,Amazing Cable.. but too good?,"After ordering 3 previous cables at ~$20 a pop, I finally got my cable that I needed for my MP3/4 (off brand). This cable was the exact wiring the player needed to display video and stereo sound. A simple ""camcorder and AV media player 3.5mm to RCA"" cable didn't work. I tried. 3 times. 4th time's the charm!However, this cable was SO good, that it really displayed the flaws of having an off brand media player. My El Cheapo device made all these weird bleeps and rustles when selecting new songs or changing from MP3 to Videos. And there was a high pitch noise that was pretty much constant until you hit a certain volume level.Overall I'm very pleased with the cable (now just not with the media player, can't win! lol)"
2,Great Movie!!,"This movie is very entertaining, but can be boring at times. But hey, what do you expect? It was made in 1953. Jack Hawkins plays a great role. Some other good movies by him are Ben Hur and The Bridge over the River Kwai. Oh, Stanley Baker is good too. I just wished they gave him a bigger role."
2,Good song selection and mixing,"This CD I just purchased today and right away I realized how good this set was. The music has energy and great uninterupted mixing throughout both CDs. I have never been a big Corsten fan but this CD impresses me, the best thing I have heard since Oaky's Creamfields. Buy this if you are into progressive."
2,great book,"Fascinating look at gender issues in child rearing. Well worth the time, plus engrossing and entertaining."
2,Tight game,"This game is awesome, tho it was missing some of the fun elments from THPS2 and THPS1, it is still fun, once you start playing it you cant stop"
2,Mesmerizing,"You don't have to be familiar with Australian bushranger Ned Kelly and his gang's crime spree in 1887-1880--this novel is about the man confronting his own mythic notoriety as he's holed up in a small town to make one last stand. Other reviews have called the narrative impressionistic, and I can't do better than that. Drewe creates dreamlike scenes from Kelly's life evoking the physical world of heat, dust, ants, parakeets, mud, rain, fire to anchor them. It's an amazing book that you won't be able to put down. One note: the original title of this novel is ""Our Sunshine""--this is the movie tie-in edition."
2,A book of what life may bring,"This is a great book to read while expecting, a great gift for the expecting, and a great book for the new baby."
2,Good read,I really enjoyed this book. I hope there are more of the out there with the same characters to be read and enjoyed.
2,Best new ska record in years,"I don't do reviews but I just have to let people know how good this disc is. I am a huge fan of 2Tone and early ska, this is fantastic, catchy groovy little CD that will get stuck in your CD palyer on repeat for weeks. The perfect summer disc. This is the first new ska cd I have enjoyed start to finish in a decade. If you liked OP Ivy and 2Tone you will love this, if your looking for punck this isnt it."
2,Love it!,"If you are the kind of person that happens to love mystery novels and also gay literature, James Lear is definitely the author you were looking for. This great writer combines both of them in the most magnificent way. His books are not only entertaining but also easy to read. I love all his books."
2,what would you have them do?,"I have to say that im tired of all this Hulk bashing. Everyone's sayin that theres too much CGI, but what else are they going to do? go out and find a green guy 2 stories tall with the intelligence of a peanut and tell him to jump the grand canyon. Right. The truth is is that since the 1970's tv show they've come a long way and I think that Ang Lee and all the people involved in this movie deserve a lot of credit."
2,Loved It,Enjoyed this book immensely. Read on a plane and then reread again when I got home. Am looking forward to new novels from Fiona Walker.
2,BT gone Pop??,"OK,Over the years BT has produced some pretty good tracks, all with his own style and signature sound. Here we have an album with a different sound that I like to describe as ""everything pop music has tried on their own, with BT doing 10 times better!""This album, on a production level, is extremely clean. It definitely shows how BT is on another level in terms of production quality and mixing. I can understand if some of his normal fans might not like this album. It is rather 'pop' like and has vocals on pretty much every track. But, it still has the good characteristics of BT's music. Great drum fills, excellent manipulations of tempo and overall mood, and the collaborations of many talented and successful artists that were integrated into most of the tracks. As a whole, I'd say that where this might not be my favorite BT production album, it absolutely shows his professional expertise and musical talent more so than ever.~D_L_O"
2,Gari reviews Gari,Brian Gari has done a remarkable job in recreating the songs and sounds of Brian Wilson. This CD is a must.
2,Never been better before or since,"If you love hard rock, you cannot leave this earth without hearing this album. There's just something about the sound of this album that makes it so unique. Unique to all other Rush albums and unique to any other rock album ever made. No filler, but Camera Eye seems a little weak compared to all the other amazing tracks."
2,Historical Fiction at it's best,"Katherine Kurtz does a wonderful job at recreating history and pondering what could have been. She looks into the lives of people desperate to save England at the height of the Battle of Britain. She explores what it must have been like to be a member of the Royal family devestated by the abdication of Edward VIII and the impending invasion of Britain. Her historical research into the Order of the Garter,the death of Thomas a' Becket - Archbishop of Canterbury,and other historical references is as accurate as historians can agree. This is one of the books in my personal library that I DO NOT lend out. I find myself checking references against Kurtz's research and have not found any conflicts.Lammas Night is a great way to introduce young people to history, making it alive and real for them"
2,Sweatin ta hip hop!,The workout was enjoyable. It is made so you can learn at your own pace. The steps are repeated a few times so it was almost easy to learn. They broke the steps down and did variations with and without arms which makes it easier or harder depending on your own personal abilities. I really worked up a sweat. This video I feel is more geared for a beginer that enjoys to dance do to the fact that it is quite repetitions in teaching the steps.The clothes they wore was a little dated but it was easy to get past that once the workout began. Be prepared to sweat if you buy this!
2,THANKS SO MUCH,Thank you so much for a great on time product. This is something that my mother has wanted for a while and it was sent in PERFECT condition.. thanks again
2,love it,different voice and wonderfully simple lyrics and songs. A little fowl in the mouth but that is what makes her unique You will love this cd and the next one she has made!
2,Peter Gabriel's Best CD Ever,"PETER GABRIEL 3 is the best album ever by Peter Gabriel. The songs are dark and scary, but in an appealing way. The themes range from loss of identity (""I Don't Remember"") to attention-getting at all costs (""Family Snapshot"") to excessive warlike behavior (""Games Without Frontiers"") to cliquish attitudes (""Not One Of Us"") to South Africa's old apartheid system (""Biko""). The songs, taken together, send a message that we could all learn from about treating each other, and the planet, with respect. Gabriel's support of efforts to free people unjustly imprisoned in countries not their own makes PETER GABRIEL 3 an essential purchase for both your ears AND your conscience."
2,fun and educational,"My 23 month old really likes this. I can put it away for a day, and when I bring it back out she plays with the people and number rings for almost 30 minutes. It isn't too loud, either. There are only about 5 places to put the people, but my daughter seems not to notice."
2,Not a pool toy,I got this for the kids and they have a great time throwing it at each other and the pets. They put it in the pool and now I have to deal with some angry things from the center of the earth. Oh well the kids did have fun.
2,He's on my mind,"This movie is a girls best friend ... ok , so if you really want to know how men sometimes can play games even when you think he's not a player ! please be ready to discover the dark side and also be ready to have some fun ...this is a must see movie . Hands up ladies & Gentlemen !!!He's on My Mind"
2,A Curious but Pleasing Mix of Celtic and Fantasy Romance,"(I received Elphame through the Amazon Vine program. Vine offers books and other items from publishers and manufacturers.)Elphame is a goddess with a problem. She's a mix of human and centaur in a blend that no one has ever seen before. Her subjects regard her with awe but leave her alone. Goddess she is, but lonely she is as well.And so it begins.Elphame must, as young people are required to do by nature, leave her family and strike out on her own to find her true identity and her place in the world. She must learn to appreciate others who, like herself, are a blending of very different cultures. She must learn to be a friend and to develop new relationships. All she does.This book is light reading and very good for a few minutes of reading before bedtime. It offers suspense and romance and, undoubtedly, will be loved by teen readers. I will suggest it for the teens I know as a good read.Four stars!"
2,"A wonderful,intriguing,debut novel","I must admit, this novel intrigued me from the get-go. I mean what kind of mother makes her hate so passionately? Read it. Now, her daughter,Lisa, she needs to come clean on the whole situation with her. I guess that is in the next book. It was beautifully written, and look foward to her sequel."
2,Good value,"What I like:1. Much lower price than similar products (Le Creuset, Martha Stewart)2. Large enough for entire 4-6 person meal--with leftovers3. Great color(s)What I don't:1. The 'paint' is chipping at the edge of the cover and pot after only a couple dozen washes/uses. I have a 4 quart Le Creuset Dutch Oven which was a gift and with similar use there are no chips or blemishes.3:1 Like vs. Not...I would make this purchase again for the price. I made a coconut-curry chicken/shrimp/lime/cilantro stew yesterday... so easy; perfect size dutch oven."
2,IF YOU DONT LIKE THIS GAME...,THIS GAME IS DA BEST!!! I PLAYED 24/7 ON THE DC AM I AM SOOOO HOOKED!!! ... I LOVED IT!!! IF YOU R A HARD CORE RPG PLAYER(LIKE ME)I RECOMEND THIS GAME AND EVEN IF UR A ACTION ADVENTURE FAN GET IT AS WELL. BEST GAME EVER!!! 100 OUT OF 10 STARS
2,Wickedly Amazing,"I bought this cd because so many people had told me how amazing it was. I bought it and the first song came on. It actaully scared me because of the loud hit. But I started to listen intently. Idina Menzel (also Maureen in RENT) gives her best performance to date. Her range is incredible and her voice is perfect for each song. She has a very low mysterious voice and a powerfully high section especially on Defying Gravity. But she also shows she can contain its power on For Good.Also Kirsten Chenoweth who is best know for Tony award winning place on You're A Good Man Charley Brown, stands out with her voice. She has a very operatic voice at times but it suites so many different styles. Its absolutly perfect for the part.Overall I was completely pleased with this CD and know that it will go down in Broadway history as an amazing and unique show. Here is my top 5 songs1. For Good2. Defying Gravity3. As Long As Your Mine4. What is this Feeling?5. No Good Deed"
2,Ultimate Collection,"This DVD collection is more of a show ""highlights"" disc- culling the best episodes from the run of the show. Those looking for a collection of the episodes as they were aired will not be satisfied with this DVD set."
2,Reality and human spirit,"I think this book was absolutely amazing. There is such depth in this book, it contains so many issues that Jews had to endure during this tmie of persecution. It makes you think how could people have been so cruel? This book definetly offers an in depth look into the holocoust(sp?) that no teacher can teach"
2,The Yr w/o Santa Claus,The bluray is exactly what I thought it was and it has a great picture. My husband loved his gift.
2,Easy Installation and Great Game,"I had this game before, but this was a few years ago and that computer died. So I recently got the itch to play some Sim City again, and Amazon delivered. I read all the negative reviews saying it didn't work and it would crash all the time randomly. Well I had exactly zero problems installing it, and it hasn't crashed once.Whoever is having problems either did something wrong, or their computer sucks and shouldn't be running it anyway. Also, when I say you did something wrong, this includes previous actions that messed up your computer that haven't manifested until this game triggered a response."
2,Never used to like it.,"At first I didn't like Vol 8 but after several listens it got better. It's mostly hit and miss throughout. It's a lot better than Stomp 442, in my opinion. It's heavier and has more variety. Crush! is an excellent opening track, 3 following tracks are also great. It isn't anywhere near their best but it;s mostly solid and a step up from Stomp 442. Not that it was a bad album but oo many songs sounded the same."
2,"Beautiful but geez, people","First, a warning: If you find wide use of tempo rubato to be a precious affectation, you're not going to like this recording. Watchorn has no reservations about the technique. I found it somewhat distracting myself, but I know that there are those who can't stand it even one little bit, especially in their Bach. They'll want to find another recording.Second, another warning: If for whatever reason you dislike highly-ornamented performances, again, this album is not for you. Watchorn has no qualms about decorating right in the center of the room (for example, the confusingly-ornamented closing note of the c-minor fugue, which mars an otherwise crystalline performance).But all that is a question of taste. This is an excellent recording of a virtuoso performance, even if it's not, to this listener's ears, the perfect gem the earlier reviews would indicate."
2,This story rocked!,"One of the best stories I have read in a several years.It has everything: mystery, sorrow, suspense, romance, magic, pirates, subversives, lions, secret agents, love, conspiracies, action, the latest in science and technology, kidnappings, motorcycles, harrowing escapes, murder, more dramatic twists than you could shake a stick at and tons splendid irony.Mr. Gold painted a wonderful picture of a colorfully artistic time long past. This is a seriously entertaining story about great entertainers.I am getting this as a gift for all the adult readers on my Christmas list."
2,Enormously entertaining and creative,How I wish this writer would do some more of his speculative SF. This collection of short stories is some of the most innovative and well conceived stuff available without a prescription. I absolutely recommend this to anyone who likes writers like greg egan or neal stephensen.
2,Fantastic hobbiest tool,"This vice is incredibly useful for any light to moderate duty tasks. It has served me very well in both soldering and using a rotary tool for cutting.I combined it immediately with the PanaVise 308 weighted base to bring it up from 3 pounds to a total of 8. The installation was trivial, and has meant this vice simply does not budge or tilt over. It also raises the vice so that the head can be positioned handle-up while the jaws are horizontal.One relatively simple modification I would like to make to the vice would be to add a thumbscrew that would keep the head's handle from sliding around, but the vice is perfectly usable without such a change.Overall, a great tool to have on hand!"
2,Impressively produced and informatively presented,"Accidental Inventions is an impressively produced and informatively presented 84 minute DVD showcasing for students grades 7 and up, just how ten of the world's most popular and influential inventions were created through laboratory or experimental accident. Unintended consequences of applied science that were to alter the world. Viewers will learn how a cocklebur inspired Velcro; how a laboratory accident created Teflon; how a failed tablecloth would give rise to Cellophane, how stainless steel was quite literally discovered in a scientist's junk pile. Also included are the stories behind the Microwave, Post-It Notes; Fingerprint Fuming; Matches; Dynamite; and Ether Anesthesia. Enhanced with interviews, historical photos, and 3D graphics, Accidental Inventions is a very strongly recommended addition to school and community library collections -- and an ideal homeschooling curriculum resource for the study of modern technology and invention."
2,Good for New Writers,Has considerably enriched me as a writer. It's with me wherever I go. That's really all that needs to be said about it.
2,Get over it,"Hvaing perused the reviews already submitted , I can't help but notice the continuing theme of disappointment in the style of this album. However , those complaining seem to want JB frozen ib time, a monument to beach bums and margaritas.When I first listened , I noticed the change in his voice , the absence of the steel drums and harmonica , the reflective tone and I wasn't sure I liked it. But the more I listened , the more it grew on me. This is a journey on a different continent , a road less travelled.Those complaining should realise that there's more to the world ( and indeed the man) than cheeseburgers and tailgate parties. He writes about life experiences and attempts to take you with him on a journey. Go along for the ride , you might learn something."
2,A True Classic,This book is a true classic for the person who knows alot about other countries. It combines a plethera of events that all roll into a great adventure story on Krakatoa Island. A must read for an A+ book report...
2,Angie Everhart & Gabrielle Reece are hot hot hot!,"This might be the funniest movie I have seen all year.The script is great.And the women are really hot! Angie Everhart has never looked better than she does in a red bikini, Gabrielle Reece is a GODDESS and the four women who play the Bonsais are super sexy, in every flavor!This is definitely worth the price!"
2,Too bad I'm not an entrepreneur!,"This book was easy to read, although does not provide the ""formula"" for becoming rich. The statistics that the authors gathered is outstanding. The authors provide insight into the differences between people who are high spenders and those who are high investors. Which one are you? Which method do you think will make you rich? Basically, I live the way the authors suggest (frugal, but smart), but they tend to make you feel bad if you are not a business owner, laywer or accountant.I liked the book's language and the way it almost gives us hope we could all be millionaires one day. Read it if you think you need a step in the right direction."
2,I LOVE IT!!!,You dont have to love classical music to love this cd...the moment you hear it you will want to hear more...i myself like all types of music...anywhere from Andre Segovia to Slipknot (if you have ever heard of them)....buy Recital De Guitarra if you love guitar....it is a mastepiece
2,This was one of the best!,This book had such a shocking and surprising ending! I loved it. In some ways it was a little depressing when I found out that Red (a character) was in on the whole thing. He seemed so nice. But that made me draw my attention away from suspecting him. So over all it made it quite interesting.
2,where the heart is review,"I believe that ""Where the heart is"" was a fantastic book had brought about a nemerous amount of peoples attention. It was fun filled and adventerous. It always grabs you by the eye waiting and wanting for something to happen. I suggest to everyone who has a chance read this book and enjoy. The are many worlds of creation and this is one yet. My favorite part is when Novalee and forney fall in love and Forney is attached to Americus with his heart and has much love for the little girl like she's his own."
2,Big and Beautiful,I was looking for a large stainless steel trashcan for over 1 year. This is fabulous! Looks great and is a perfect size for a family.
2,An excellent collection of songs.,"Every song on this album is great. Many people absolutely hate ""victor"", but i love the guys' take on gregorian chants!If you are a young punk music fan that is new to Blondie, you must get this album.The greatest reason this album is loved by fans of blondie are the credits:Deborah HarryChris SteinClement BurkeJimmy DestriNigel HarrisonFrank ""The Freak"" InfanteTogether, these musicians just clicked, and each has contributed to the band's collective success. Those were the days."
2,hover disc 101,"I've written this because I read a couple of reviews that says the kids managed to rip/wreck it in less than an hour. I have two very active boys, 6 & 8, and they've had them for months and haven't ripped either one yet. If however you do get a puncture or tear, packing tape should do the trick for repairs. We haven't done it ourselves, but I think a little helium would make the tricks a little easier, especially if you bought the one with the wristbrand. We lost the first one we had: it went over the fence and by the time we could go looking for it, it was gone.... So playing with it in a large open space would be better than an enclosed back yard. All in all, the kids love them, and the designs are fun too."
2,"Fun, just don't overthink it.","I got this book for free off of a community sharing bookshelf, and enjoyed it immensely. Does Card seem to be making some bold and controversial political statements? Yes. Do I care? Not at all. Is it easy to ignore in favor of the fun characters, great action, and fast-paced plot? Absolutely.I think the key here is that I am not a Card fan. I haven't read anything of his before, so I wasn't expecting anything in particular. It seems like a lot of reviewers wanted to take this book way too seriously, and from that perspective, sure, it sucks. But if you let it be what it is, a silly action novel, then you can have some fun."
2,Kids Love Webkinz,"I bought this toy for my 11 year old grandaughter and she loves it. I call her Kitten from time to time, so it seemed appropriate. She has an account at the Webkinz website that gives her hours of entertainment and this cat is a great addition to her collection."
2,A truly lovely surprise,"This was such a fascinating tale based on real events. I felt a part of the story; I cared about the characters; I didn't want to put the book down. I learned so much! Wonderful, wonderful book."
2,Given as a gift to my mom,This author is from Alabama; therefore my mom was familiar with the area in and around Birmingham. She has really enjoyed reading these books.
2,"Pick a date, any date . . .","I almost put this book down after the first page. How much can you expect from a story built around a famous event when neither the writer nor the editors have bothered to learn when it happened? On the off chance that the author was playing with time for some surreal purpose yet to be revealed I kept reading. No surrealism here - just a straightforward mystery yarn, notable for its humor, interesting characters and very successful evocation of the ""late fifties."" I'm glad I read it, and that's disturbing because sloppy editing almost scared me away. Dare we hope for a sequel - ""The Day Camelot Died, Nov. 22, 1962""?"
2,Real Life,One of the few albums(CD's) I have ever bought that I start on track 1 and continue through to the end without fast forwarding and skipping around to find the only good song on the whole CD. I have over 150 cd's and to be honest there are maybe 3 or 4 that I never get tired of listening to and Single White Female Cd is one of them. Being a single white female I believe is the reason I can relate to all of the songs one way or another but I also feel it is enjoyable for everyone from all walks of life to listen too. Because it is about real life.
2,Danielle's Opinion on this book,I think that this book was a different look at a different culture. It taught you how life was back then and at the same time it it kept your interest by putting a love story in with it. I would recomend this book to anyone in high school or older because of some graphic parts.
2,Great Tool,"This is an excellant tool for most situations in construction that other regular and circular saws cannot achieve.With exchangable blades that will cut virtually any material, this saw can accomplish whatever you can throw at it."
2,Essential to All Dead Fans,"The box set itself is not essential to Grateful Dead fans, but the albums definitely are. The Golden Road box set contains 10 albums (12 discs) starting from the Dead's beginning. It is a great deal, I think. If you pay for each album separately, you will probably pay around the same price. And all of the discs are completely filled with bonus tracks and hidden tracks. It seems like a lot of money, but if you do not own any Dead albums and know you like them, then I would recommend this box set to get started. I got mine about a month ago, and I haven't stopped listening to the Dead since."
2,Astonished,"I read the book and was astonished at the information and stories outlined. Do I believe all of it, no. But even if 1/10th of the information is true, it would be a catastrophe to have an opportunist like John Kerry as our Commander in Chief."
2,Highly recommended,Shipped quickly with OEM packaging and instructions. Installed easily replacing a motion sensor with proper settings which wouldn't turn off after triggered. Worked flawlessly since installation.
2,Great play,"This is a great, tragic play. It's not too hard to read, and it's pretty short (!), so you could read it in a day probably. This play will have you questioning what you would do in both Antigone's and Creon's situations, so you know it's pretty good. And the important question: who's the tragic hero?!? I'm still deciding"
2,Best buy,"I was very pleased with this purchase. The satisfaction i felt when completed..is beyound words. It is hanging (w/a beautiful) frame inmy dining room, all who saw were amazed. I took a picture with scones also purchased ( internet). I could not ever find something like this/not at this cost. I recommend anyone to try this(paint your own)."
2,"For the most part, succeeds at what it's trying to be","My aunt got this book for me a few years ago when I mentioned to her that I'd like to learn to cook. She knew that I needed simple recipes and that I have very little time to plan and prepare meals for my family. To that end, this book is useful. It advertises that every recipe contains only 5 ingredients and can be prepared in 3 (or less) easy steps, and it certainly does that. It's utilitarian to the core---all black-and-white text, no pictures, two recipes crammed onto every page for a total of over six hundred recipes. One could certainly complain about the lack of pictures, but that isn't what the book is trying to be, and for what it's trying to be, it does it pretty well.My only complaint about the book is that some of the recipes I've tried have been duds. Be sure to test these recipes out in advance before serving them to company."
2,Great Gift,This gift was sent as a birthday present. The little girl that received the gift is quite happy with it. She plays with it every day. Good for helping to learn colors and color coordination.
2,Whatever They're Called....,"Jefferson Airplane, Jefferson Starship and Starship whatever they're called they created great music for more than 30 years. In 1985 Paul Kantner won the right to claim the name Jefferson so the remaining members just named Starship.I was just skeptical when I heard the band name Starship when We Built This City started to move up the charts. But I found myself loving their new name because I really liked that song which became #1 in 1986. It is too bad the DJ part of the song was deleted because I really love that part. Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now is often heard in Wedding Ceremony in Japan. (Sounding a bit strange because the title reminds me of Dustin Hoffman's The Graduate). Key To The City was originally for VU's previously unreleased debut album Phoenix Rising. Sara, It's Not Enough, Jane are my favorite hits during that era.Recommended for 80's pop rock fans. And their earlier efforts such as Red Octopus should not be overlooked."
2,Simply the best!,"I'll cut right to the chase--if you have a Garmin GPS unit that is MapSource compatible, and use it on the ocean, buy this CD! Garmin's Water Ways & Lights CD is a total joke compared to the BlueChart CD. The level of detail is an exact duplication of NOAA paper charts--very, very accurate and very, very detailed. I use this software with my GPSMAP 162, and the only drawback is that with the detail level set to high, it slows the screen redraw rate down considerably. but, when you're actually on the water, this isn't even noticeable. Bottom line--this is a great product."
2,amazing chakra meditation,fantastic meditation to awaken and re energise the chakras. Beautiful and peaceful track at the end of the chanting takes you further into a relaxing meditation. Highly recommended for anyone that has an interest in chakra meditations.
2,Favorite O.A.R. cd,This is my favorite O.A.R. CD so far. I just can't get enough of it. very strongly recommended
2,Exactly what I needed!,These pot toes work better than expected. No rain or overwatering to cause my outdoor plants to end up with root rot!
2,Plug and play,I pugged this in and it worked perfect. Faster better stronger. Just like Lee Majors. Quick delivery. I'd buy more if I had slots. Dell Dimentia 4800. P5.
2,should've bought them sooner,"I wanted a set of these headphones for years, and now I can enloy listening to music at any volume level I want without disturbing my family. I was pleased with the prompt delivery and excellent cost, I could hardly wait to connect them to my sound system and start enjoying the great quality of sound. The extra length of cable let's me move around and work on projects in comfort. I've used them for hours. If I had another head I'd purchase it a pair."
2,very good!,Really good tea! Who could not like this?I guess everyone has their own opinion.The tassimo brewing system is awesome!and this tea is great! and hard to find in the store.
2,shakira is awesome,"I am not hispanic and do not understand Spanish. Yet this is one of my favorite cd's. The first time I heard Shakira, I knew I had to have this. Shakira's vocals range from fun to powerful to haunting. Her music ranges from emotional ballads to hopping dance tunes. Un Poco De Amor is a dance club favorite."
2,great movie,I am so glad to have this for my kids. the price is great I received it in a couple of days. My kids will be thrilled
2,a book for everyone,The Four Agreements is a little book that everyone should carry around in their back pocket. I have bought this book for several people and will continue to give it out. Living by the principles of Don Miguel Ruiz's wisdom is a gift to world and very helpful in all communities. Thank you.
2,it really is the best show i've ever seen,"as a good friend of mine recently said, 'it's like watching a movie every week.' truer words never spoken.you don't need me to discuss the merits of the show. about 500 people have already aptly done so. but i will just say it's actually a *pleasure* to watch this show. i feel like i want to give ron moore and his team a big, fat hug. they don't condescend to their audience. they never rest on their laurels. they reward the loyal viewers. and they never, never, never insult our intelligence. and yes, the production values are incredible. and yes yes, the CGI is better than anything you've ever seen on the silver screen (kind of makes you wish he'd been in charge of the star wars prequels).thanks, gang, for a truly terrific show. i feel privileged to watch it."
2,So Cool!,"I just got my TFF CD today. So cool! These guys were one of the the coolest during the 80s decade. Their sound was sultry, hot and smooth like silk. Good thing cds are made to last for a long time, because if they weren't, I would definitely eventually wear this one out. This one is a treasure!"
2,A wonderful starting point for an interested soul,"If you are ever interested in Wicca and don't know where to begin, this book is it. Not only is it a wonderful starting point for the new witch but it is a great reference for both the solitary and coven practitioner."
2,Wrath of the Titans,"Very enjoyable movie with lots of actions and good story line. Watched the movie with my grandkids who remembered the first movie ""Clash of the Titans"" and made the link to ""Wrath of the Titans."""
2,Really Cool Game,"Pokemon Blue sets itself apart from other video games because it has a plot, and it can be saved. It is a really fun game, and it is easy to become obsessed with playing it. However, the graphics are pretty dismal and it gets boring after a while. I recommend you get Pokemon Silver or Gold instead."
2,"I'll do the stars, but this part is too much for every bloody purchase","I'll do the stars, but this part is too much for every bloody purchase... If something it extra special or dang annoying I will let you know"
2,Why buy a typical InkJet Printer?,"I have had my new printer for 2 weeks now, and it is every thing that I expected. I have scanned odd shaped documents, as well as copied a bunch of stuff. Slower to copy color than I anticipated, but the quality was excellent. Great for projects of all kinds"
2,The best so far,"Like many of the others who have written their thoughts about the lastest in the CWG series, I found this one to have the most personally profound enlightenment for my own place in the search for who I am. I could not read more than a page or two at a time without having to pause to reflect upon the messages and knowledge presented in a very clear and concise manner.I highly recomment this work along with all of the other works in this series to anyone who is looking for some direction in their life and an explanation of why everything is at it appears to each of us."
2,Mine is a life saver.,"I am in the process of wiring a boat and the mass of wires can get very confusing. The wire tracker is in constant use and works well out to about 200' but you do have to remember that any wire electrically connected to the transmitter will be carrying a signal. For example, in tracing home wiring if you connect to the neutral (white wire) you will find a signal on all the white wires because they are all connected to the same bus at the panel. Similarly if you trace the hot (black wire) you have to turn off the breakers to isolate the wire you are tracing. But you should do that anyway to avoid a lot of smoke and possibly a rather painful supprise.Overall, the Wire Tracker is well worth the money as long as you follow the instructions and have a little understanding of how it works."
2,Coheed and Cambria In keeping of silent earth 3 song 3,Cuts Marked in the March of Men is an absolute masterpiece. This song is my favorite one. This was the song that introduced me to Coheed and Cambria. In my personal opinion this song would go great with the movies Resident Evcil Apocolypse.The Dev man
2,the funnest ride to hell you'll ever take,"from the opening chords of this masterpiece, you will know you're in for a treat. the guitars are a menacing aural assault that, backed by a relentless rhythm, forges a melody that is engaging and haunting. The shouts of the vocals seem relevant, although I can't say I understand the themes of many of the songs. That said, this is clearly an album made with...love.absolute favorite is the title track, which turns all in its path into smoldering embers. The whole album is great, though...quite possibly my favorite album"
2,ring adapter for camera,love this thing. i have an old slr camera and needed to have this to adapt the filters and lens to my digital.
2,THE BIBLE OF ANATOMY FOR ARTISTS,"I KNOW FROM EXPERIENCE, AS WELL AS WE ALL DO WHO DRAW, THAT THERE'S NO ONE STOP SHOP BOOK FOR ANYTHING REALLY. BUT IF YOU WANT TO LEARN ANATOMY; I MEAN REALLY LEARN (NOT JUST SOME SHORTCUTS AND TIPS), THIS IS THE BOOK FOR YOUR. CAUTION, STUDY IS REQUIRED...SERIOUS ARTISTS ONLY."
2,"Wraith, so gothic it's dead","Wraith is the ultimate in personal horror. You create a dead character, control that charcter as it fights it's darker half, and the end is never what you could possibly imagine. In a previous review someone mentioned 'saying Wraith was a gothic game would be to say Lord of the Rings is a story about elves.' That is the truest comparison one can make about Wraith. If you want a game that you pick up and play with very simple rules and stories, go play DnD, if you want a slugfest, get Werewolf, if you want a game in which you must always use your head before your fists and be nine steps ahead of your darker half just to get by with your sanity intact, purchase Wraith. You won't be dissappointed."
2,Inlook on animal psychology,"Interesting and funny look at the behavior of the endangered species of orangutans. This book describes the experience of Russon and her colleagues' work in transitioning abused and pet orangutans back to living in a natural environment. Orangutans are visibly very cunning animals, which have managed to trick the researchers in this national park more than once. Russan recounts her experience with an orangutan that insisted on washing clothes, and describes stories of them raiding secured guard posts and untying canoes and taking them up and down the river.I recommend this book to anyone who has interests in psychology, especially that of animals and people with pets."
2,perfect fit,"Had no idea which size, brand to look for and these arrived and fit perfectly! They are great and arrived quickly."
2,Not that perfect,"They are ok but they should be a little bit longer!! My baby is very interested in things around him and he would love touching them and grabbing them but he can NOT reach them!!! Otherwise, good, colorful product and the clips are useful for when you have a baby sheet over the car seat"
2,Jesus is Just Alright,I bought this cd for this song. There are a couple of others that are good too. The Doobies are a favorite group of mine.
2,Garwood makes magic again,"What can I say that other reviews haven't expounded upon?It took a guilty-pleasure trope (arranged marriage) and crafted it masterfully. The beginning chapter, with their first meeting alone, was touching and lovely.Also, one of the few novels I have read to mention menstruation as a reason not to have sex, and then make it utterly adorable anyway.A Garwood novel, out of the many, that I can revisit and still grin."
