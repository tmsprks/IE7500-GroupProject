1,"So where's the ""fun""?","What kind of a cheap @$$ game is this?! It's not even a game, hardly! It's like a crappy TV show where you pick how slow it goes. There's no challenge at all. And there are so few leads and options in each case that it's impossible to NOT win each case. And it all amounts to a grand total of maybe 3 hours of gameplay, if you could even call it that in this case.I can't imagine why this game is even on the market. The only thing it's good for, perhaps, is a nice hearty laugh... because it's so bad. It's a total rip-off. I could create a better game, and I don't know anything about creating stuff like that. Get the CSI games instead. Those are awesome. The Law and Order games are great too. Just do not get this game.I'd give it zero stars if I could."
1,product quality,"it is impossible to cram it down any drain, I could only get it partially down. It was also nearly impossible to remove it and I thought I would have to call a plumber to get the thing out. It did nothing at all. It was a struggle to get it in and a struggle to remove it."
1,Not quite as advertised,"If you are expecting this to actually be a ""Large"" canister - do not. This canister is actually short and much smaller than the other InterDesign sells (within the same set) that is not advertized as large. This canister stands about three inches high, and is surprisingly SMALL."
1,Avoid,"i actually gave this zero stars, but amazon for some reason (?) wouldn't let me. i bought this CD in the hopes of purchasing a quality piece of history. what i received was a CD in which the tracks on the CD did not match the tracks on the tracklist. it's a total rip-off."
1,Another 'sound-alike' interpretation,"This is as uninspiring and insipid as it can get. Quite similar to Schiff's WTC - mechanical and boring. I suggest GouldThe Glenn Gould Edition - Bach: The Well-Tempered Clavier, Book IThe Glenn Gould Edition - Bach: The Well-Tempered Clavier, Book II, NikolayevaBach - Well Tempered Clavier - Tatiana Nikolayeva (4 CD Set), RichterBach: Well-Tempered Clavier, Feinberg The Art of Samuel Feinberg Vol 1.Bach: Well-Tempered Clavier. Book 1 & 2 (3 cd set). as more satisfying interpreters."
1,"Great Concept, Cheap Construction","I LOVED this game as a kid so you can imagine my excitement for my little one to play this game. Was the construction this cheap back in the 80s? From the start, one of the hippos did not work at all. Another hippo's head moved but the head did not lift off the board so it just pushed the balls around. This game really is a classic. I hope that they will ""upgrade"" the game so that it can really be enjoyed."
1,not what i expected,"MY 5 YEAR OLD GRANDSON LOVED THE STORE OF THE 3 BEARS, SO I THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE A GOOD DVD FOR HIM TO WATCH,NOT SO. THE ANIMATION IS AWFUL, CHARACTERS WERE UNREALISTIC,OVER ALL JUST A POORLY MADE MOVIE. THE KID NEVER WATCHED IT! WASTE OF MONEY."
1,Disappointing except as a quickstart guide,"Although marketed as a ""quickstart"" guide, I was disappointed at the lack of technical and explanatory text. Data rate is an important variable using Premiere, yet Bolante discounts a discussion of the complex topic by referring the reader back to Adobe's user guide and online help system...two pieces of the product that encouraged me to run screaming for better information. Bolante's book tends toward linear instruction (i.e., do this, then this, then this...) and is best used, indeed, as only a quick start tool."
1,Didn't work after 3 weeks usage,The item just didn't work after 3 weeks. I originally got this item for my baby while he sleep since by then we have pollen issue in the neighborhood. Very disappointed at this item. Won't buy this brand again.
1,watch how you shop,"I was looking for a trampoline and I kept looking around for the encloser trampolines. I purchased the 13 foot trampoline encloser but I didn't realize that the trampoline came separate. I have the encloser kit witch I spent $70.00 on and no trampoline. When I looked on the internet I never saw that the tramponine was separate and it wasn't clearly explained that it was just the encloser part. I also found out that the size of the trampone is not standard, therefore, in order to utilize the encloser kit, I have to spend another $110.00 for shipping on top of the shipping it cost me for the cover and the encloser kit. I am really upset that this is costing a large amount of money just because they didn't specifically say that the encloser kit needed the trampoline. Bevery careful, it is not every day that you go out and buy a trampoline and the encloser kits are totaly separate. I am very disapointed."
1,Won't work Anymore,"I have had the Disk 512 MB Cruzer Mini USB Flash Drive for about 3 months and it worked out well then all of the sudden it stopped working. The computer will not acknowledge it is even connected. They also have poor tech support, stay away from this product."
1,Caution: Beware of the Bluray version - poor video transfer,"First, i loved this movie... the story, cinematography, etc. is up there and reflected in the dvd related reviews here... no argument therei just rented the bluray version from blockbuster (i have a samsung bd-p2500 player) and noticed immediately 'pixel dancing' on the screen (i have a samsung 1080p dlp tv.. so the player and tv work very well together)having worked with graphics some, my educated guess is that the bluray version appears to be a reprocessing of the dvd digital data. the resolution on screen is NOT at all at par with any other bluray disk i've viewed so far. it shows artefactual noise of digital image upscalingif the dvd version is cheaper for this title, i'd select it over the bluray version as the latter is not genuinely high resolution."
1,Don't waste your money,"I received this item as a gift, and it is the worst laptop cooler I have come across. After 8 months, the right fan broke. Before it broke, it was annoying anyway, because the fans were so loud - louder than the fans on my HP Pavilion zd8000 - which aren't the quietest. The pad also isn't very smart - it always stays on."
1,Could have been good!,"Lots of reviews sound good. I bet they are from the vender of this product.I could not imagine anyone being happy with these tapes.One male voice says a word in English loudly Followed by a female in Spanish whispering, or maybe she has laryngitis.The faintness of the second voice is such that it makes the tapes WORTHLESS. I could even finish listening. Tempted you may be to buy but these tapes are a real disappointment. I had to put 1 star minimum to post here but really it gets none!"
1,wrong photo,The photo next to the book is of the revised and updated book. I ordered it only to find out that I was getting the old book with a different cover and outdated info. Not very happy.
1,Breast Infection,I am a first time mom and had no idea how breastfeeding would go. After being home for a day or two I started using this pump just to see if had enough milk and to give my nipples a rest. I developed a breast infection and I truly believe it was due to this pump. It is terrible and it takes forever to get an ounce of milk. After having two infections in a two week period my Mom purchased me the Medela pump in style. It is a completely different experience. I have not had another infection and is not nearly as rough on my breast at this pump was. I also know someone else who used this pump and developed breast infections. She switched to the Medela and hasn't had anymore problems.
1,This is not Planet P,"Beware, if you are looking for a Planet P fix don't buy this CD. I do not understand why this CD is listed under Planet P but it is. This CD is nothing but 5 techno dance tracks that sound nothing like Planet P or Tony Cary."
1,"Great cartoon, but not correct episodes","This is a great buy for a child. It's a good series. My problem is that I want the whole series, and not just 4 episodes. I can't find a dvd with more than 4 episodes, so I assumed that being the first volume, this would have the first 4 episodes. It doesn't. It contains episodes 5, 9, 8 and 10 (in that order!!!). Why would you put episode 9 before 8?! So I'm not even going to bother buying volume 2, because who knows what episodes are on that one. Hopefully one day they will release the whole series, in correct order."
1,Constant error messages with this drive,"It may not be a bug with Lacie (could be inherent to USB 2.0, or XP SP2, or ???), but whoever is at fault, the drive constantly gives hardware errors. LaCie support is unhelpful despite the fact that if you do a web search, tons of people are having ""delayed write failed"" problems with LaCie drives. Save yourself a lot of aggravation and avoid LaCie products."
1,Undoubtedly the worse math textbook I have ever seen,"This was the text book that was used in a course I took in Finite Math. Do not waste your time or money on this book. It does not go into any depth whatsoever, many of the thereoms shown were just pulled out of the authors hat without any proof of any kind. I honestly, had a hard time staying awake as I would read it, since it is so dull. It places far too much emphasis on phony applications and almost known on good solid theory. I only wish I could give this book a negative rating."
1,Yuck!,"This is the worst. If only I could find a better one, this would go directly into the trash can. Pills slip, get cut into a really small 1/2 and a really big 1/2. It works correctly only about 40% of the time."
1,hardly representative of the 90s,"has anyone else noticed that there isnt a single nirvana song? of all of the bands of the 90s, nirvana was undoubtedly one of the more luminary bands. and yet they appear nowhere on this compilation. instead, we are treated to the worst of the consumerist, disposable pop trash the 90s had to offer. a retrospective album should do more to cover the diverse styles of music that were prevalent at this time, but this album falls short in every aspect."
1,Price was right,"My wife picked this up at a rummage sale, thinking it looked like something I'd enjoy. The first thing I did was check the index for 'Tesla'. When I found no reference to him I immediately knew that the book was lacking, and checked Amazon's reviews, which confirmed my suspicion. Oh well, my wife meant well, and it may be worth what she paid."
1,Very poor quality for HDMI,"After two years of using component cables for my Xbox 360, and a year of using a Monster HDMI cable for my PS3, I decided that the difference in quality between the two was noticable enough for me to go out and buy another HDMI cable for my Xbox. After shopping around, and seeing the price and reviews for this cable, I bought it, and in all honesty, this cable is much worse than even my component cables. I tried a few different movies, and a few different games, all to no avail. Characters in my games are choppy, and pixelated, and all of the movies, even in HD quality are blurry. I decided to switch the two cables to see if it was just my Xbox, and immediately noticed the difference. This is a poor cable and I would not reccomend it to anyone who cares about the quality of the graphics on their screen."
1,Look for another book!,"After reading about half of Mr. Kern's book, I found myself wondering if the purpose of this book was less about helping others aquire self-discipline and more about giving Mr. Kern an opportunity to 'toot-his-own-horn'. while I do agree with his '6 steps' and believe in the value of setting goals, not comparing yourself to others, etc., I did not find any advise from Mr. Kern as to how to accomplish these things in my life. This is not to mention the some what poor organization of the book and general lack of interesting material!After struggling to finishing the whole book, I highly recommend buying something else!"
1,Returned it!,"Quick service, professionally done and on time.Only one DVD had sound past the introduction.Won't get this one again.Item being reviewedThe Charles Dickens Collection, Vol. 2 (David Copperfield / The Pickwick Papers / The Old Curiosity Shop / Dombey and Son)The Charles Dickens Collection, Vol. 2 (David Copperfield / The Pickwick Papers / The Old Curiosity Shop / Dombey and Son)"
1,A Really Bad Movie!!!,This is a horrible movie! One of the worst films I have ever seen. The cover art is the only quality thing about this product.
1,Rowenta Power Duo problems,"Dont waste your money, this iron worked great in the beginning but with less than 6 months of using it and trust me we do not iron that often, this started dripping water. First noticed as I sat it upright to cool down and returned to find it sitting in a puddle of water. Hasnt worked right since and the steam is not up to par. No reason for the problem as it has never been dropped or knocked around."
1,Are you feeling lucky?,"I needed a remote switch to control a 12v pool light. The first Logisys RM01 Wireless Power Control arrived and failed to operate after I installed it outside. Then I tested it with a 12 power supply on the bench with the switch in line with the power supply (+)and then in line with the neutral (-). There are two ground wires in the unit and I tested with each and then with both attached to a known ground. The tally light on the sending units showed they were transmitting, and the batteries tested AOK. The unit never operated in any configuration. .The seller was gracious and promptly sent a second unit. Despite my high hopes, that too was DOA and failed in every configuration.It seems that there are some units that are AOK and they produce happy customers. I am not among them. I wasted a lot of time and fortunately only a small amount of money. If you feel lucky and want to roll the dice, order one, and good luck!"
1,not for Glock 22 40 S&W,this mag holder may work great for the Glock 9mm's but it won't hold a Glock 22 40 s&w double stack mag. If you're shooting a Glock 22 don't buy this product.
1,Can't get it on my iPad so had to cancel,Bought iPad2 to replace my Kindle and love the Kindle app but can't get the SR to download with an iPad version...
1,VERY SLOW SHIPPING!!!!,"I really can not rate item itself, I HAVE NOT RECIEVED IT YET!!I AM VERY DISSATISFIED with Amazon's shipping.I Ordered on 12/5/05 Item said it would ship in 2 days it has now been 10 days and is still waiting to be shipped. I was origianly quoted as it being delivered between the 12-14th. Now they say 21-23.10 DAYS AND ITS NOT EVEN LEFT AMAZON YET!!!!This is NOT GOOD BUSINESS PRACTICE!!!"
1,Not nearly as intelligent as it tries to be.,"i must first start by saying that ed nortons acting in this movie was tremendous. however, that is this entire pictures only redeeming quality. my friend has a trained woodchuck that i think could have given a better theatrical performance than brad pitt. why he was cast in this role is beyond me. at least he wasnt trying to effect an accent (seven years in tibet). on to the plot, it really wasnt as original as people would have us believe. a man gets addicted to attending group therapy sessions. OH, THE IRONY!! dont patronize me. and after the sixth sense's ending, this one was almost predictable, and not nearly as satisfying. i am anxiously awaiting the time when brad pitt's career goes the way of billy ray cyrus'."
1,SA-XR55 Remote Problem,"I received this product only to find that it's remote sensor is located at the extreme front lower-left corner. When placed in my equipment cabinet, the sensor was hidden behind the wood frame of it's glass door, rendering the remote inoperable. I was forced to return the SA-XR55 and replaced it with a comparable Kenwood VRS-7100."
1,pretty dismal,"Being a passionate fan of both Lord of the Rings and the Patrick O'Brian novels, I thought this might be a fun romp. What a disappointment. I honestly thought it was for adults, but this is actually young adult or pre-teen fiction. To compare it to Patrick O'Brian is scandalous. For young people it will serve fine as something to stick in their duffle to take off to summer camp. I honestly can't imagine an adult enjoying this, but apparently many have. Wonders never cease."
1,Should be subtitled old people can be heros to.,"Honestly, I think Stephen King ran out of ideas here. This has so many references to his other books it could be called a compilation. Not to mention the fact this suffers from the all to frequent problems King problem of confused endings.I am an avid King fan but was let down by this tale. If you are new to King start with Bag of Bones not this one it is likely to turn you off to King. I gave it two stars because while there are a lot of borrowed ideas from other books there are some orignal ideas here. I wish King had expanded on those ideas more instead of using the recycling bin."
1,Really Zaps Rats Until it Breaks,"I ordered a six pack of these traps. We have 10 acres of open space behind us that's filled with assorted critters including literally 100's of pack rats. They come into the yard at nite and decimate the garden. I gave one trap to a neighbor and set the remaining 5 using peanut butter for bait. We caught rats in all six traps the first nite and had varying degrees of success for the next week. I was delighted. Then I discovered I was unable to set one of the traps because the plastic latch that holds the trap in the set position had worn smooth. Watch out fingers!! The same thing happened to two more traps leaving me with 3 working traps. They're a great idea, much easier and safer to set than the old wooden ones, and they catch rats. I would have given them 5 stars if they had been more reliable. At 5 bucks a pop they should last longer than a week."
1,Diva-in-training needs better material,"A year in the making and dozens of producers and songwriters. The result is entirely mediocre. Granted, there are some standouts that are radio-friendly such as the Christina co-penned ""Miss Independent"" but rest is pretty much lacking in any memorable hooks, the elusive element so many pop divas live and die by. It's quite obvious that all these stellar 5 star reviews are coming from naive teens who have grown up on a steady diet of corporate muzak and can't appreciate how bland and predictable music has become. Her voice is efficient but lacks the nuance and depth of other more seasoned singers. One wonders with material this boring whether she will be given an opportunity to develop after the onslaught of AI finalists all scramble for their bit of pop stardom."
1,Huge Disappointment,"Why do kids always seem to like the worst movies? I adore Jon Stewart and to see this brilliantly funny man mired in the dross that is Doogal, along with Judy Dench, another one of my favorites, was such a disappointment. Thank goodness I rented this before buying it because it is ATROCIOUS!"
1,The Midney Factory,"Clearly influenced by the Star Wars movies of his time, Midney was fond of taking bittersweet European-style string melodies and overlaying them with electronic sci-fi burbles, then arranging the songs in dramatic, soundtrack fashion. The results could be beautiful, histrionic, or peculiar. This second USA-European Connection album is better than the boppier, bubblegum first lp, but suffers from third-grade lyrics and Saturday morning cartoon singing."
1,Honesty,"I think it's dishonest of you to publish only the favorable reviews, and to discard the unfavorable ones. I will write no more reviews for your website.PETER A. DULLEA"
1,soooo disappointing,"Cool effects do not a cool movie make! A very thinly threaded plot of cobbled together scenes that might have developed into something engaging if not treated so superficially. The 'fairy forest and the great white stag'? How about an inkling of how this helps Snow White understand her destiny and her choices? Awakened by True Love's first kiss? There is no emotional connection evident between SW and the Huntsman or SW and William or anyone else that would make you think she'd ever be revived. Really, really glad I didn't pay to see this in a theater."
1,Knights of the Round Table Meets Vietnam,"The feelings I got from this book was far too much one of trying to to two very different things. The idea of the Knights of the Inner Sphere being founded in the beginning works well. However, the rest of the novel is very much a ""Vietnam War in Space."" It's quite annoying, and begins even before the story. A dirty internal war yes, but my lord, did it have to be TELEGRAPHED in the dedication?On the other hand, the protagonist is portrayed as a whiny twit in the later ""Twilight of the Clans"" books."
1,Picture is not a good depiction,"The color of the ring was not as pictured, hint of the palest blue. The sizing is a bit smaller than anticipated and it seems that the stone side is more flat instead of round. It probably would have been more flattering to have 5 stones and a more circular appearance.It still stacks and is not that bad for the price"
1,not for everyone,"I wish this had worked for me, unfortunately it caused my daughter to have lots of tummy trouble and gas"
1,Dental Night Guard,The sleep guard did not keep my mouth open enough at night. My jaws still clenched tight.
1,UBER GARBAGE!,"Gave your cd a try and forked out the money online to buy this. Since then ive listened to 3 times and it completely sucks! I WANT MY MONEY BACK! I was misled by all the positive feedback you have on amazon, after reading them again it turns out they are all fake just like your album! Not trying to be rude but you really cant sing and your lyrics say nothing about my life! get a new job!"
1,Cats Didn't Like it,"I bought Innova wet when I had 1 kitten in the house and he shunned it. I bought a second can when kitten #2 arrived and she backed away from it! I had one extra can in which I added some water to soup it up, and neither kitty ate it. After my unscientific tests, I can't recommend this formula for my cats. Maybe yours will like it more."
1,Bla,I don't know why I ordered this i don't like Stallone this movie is so like him loud obnoxious and stupid.
1,urban flex,I was hoping for some better remixes of this track. They are still pretty good. I like the bonus trax alot.
1,Great game but poorly constructed.,There are plenty of 'Shut the Box' games available for half the price or less but I was looking for better quality and was willing to spend more. Shipping was superb and the game was beautifully wrapped in special paper and I thought what a lovely gift this was going to be. Unfortunately the craftsmanship of the game itself was severely disappointing and will be keeping the game because it would be too embarrassing to give to someone else. The quality of the catalog that came enclosed far exceeded that of the game.
1,How could they do this to Godzilla?!,"This film is probably the best example of where movies are heading nowadays: big special effects, little or no plot. The acting was terrible, as was the script. It was meant to be funny and clever, I suppose, and it achieves the funny part, though it falls short of clever.As for the special effects, yeah, they were good, but they completely butchered Godzilla. So the Godzilla in the original movie was a guy in a suit, but I can just imagine what the directors of that one could have done with some CGI! In the new version, Godilla is just an overgrown T-Rex. How does an iguana go from being a lizard to a bipedal, bird hipped dinosaur anyway, even through extreme mutation? It's just cheesy. Also, the baby zilla remind me WAY too much of velociraptors.Even if this film was meant to be a parody, as some have argued, it shouldn't have been. They should have let some TALENTED directors recreate this story for all it's glory."
1,ergonomically inadaquite,It picks up well but the grip handle hurts your hand after a while. It could have been designed better
1,HORRIBLE,"I can't believe I read the whole thing. I kept hoping it would get better, that something would happen...nothing did. First of all, college kids don't act this way; as if they were 45 or 50 years old. Let's just say, there was way too much latent stuff going on between the friends and rivals and mentors...It just seems as if the authors promoted a lot of touching and male nakedness going on. Weird. If you got rid of all the useless drivel about Princeton, the book would be 10 pages long. It appears as if the authors wanted a memoir of their time at Princeton, not to actually write a story; let alone make it somewhat interesting. The characters were uninteresting and boring. The plot was way too unbelievable. The characters were able to walk around crime scenes and escape from police as if they were invisible. The authors were far out of their league. I wish I could have the time back that I spent reading this wreck."
1,Starts out great then fails big time!,"I picked up this book at the Anchorage Airport on my way to the village as I had nothing to read. The beginning grabbed me and was fast paced - My kind of book. Then something happens to the plot, characters, and writing style. It turns predictable, superficial, and sophmoric. The whole thing is totally unbelievable and reeks with bad science. It's a great idea gone very bad. I did, however finish the book just to see if the bad guys win. The only thing missing with the telepathic and stupid but somehow very intelligent neanderthals living in a lost world in the Himalayas was their contact with aleins."
1,Like The Title--Distatseful,"A small work of distasteful stories that exploits the underbelly of human experience. This is a book for the dispirited and those without hope. It is no more than a breadcrumb trail of dispair masquerading as nourishment--it substitutes irony for redemption, craft for insight. If you want to be depressed and pretend you are thinking, better get a mediocre bottle of scotch and smack it a against your head instead of spending time with this little book."
1,"Nice looking, too bad there was no picture - no replacement?","Ordered the this TV from Amazon because it was the best price I could find. Product delivered with cracked case and no picture showed up when turned on. Is this a Samsung defect or did Amazon just send me a damaged TV - not sure, but read on.I asked Amazon to replace the TV. They said there were no more available?!?! Well, that's weird since my search showed they were still offering the same exact TV at the same price!Makes you wonder what is going on here. Support? There is no phone number to call anywhere on the web site. Their email support was very responsive, but no one would give me a phone number to discuss the situation.At least they paid to ship the item back."
1,Carrie isn't the worst singer ever but she ain't great...,"I bet youc ould ffind zillions of people all across America with the same voice as her, do you know why? Because she doesn't have anything different to offer, no accent, no power, no range. Her voice is just mediocre in general. In addition to that, she had her management pick the most bland, common, sappy ballads they could find and mush them together on a poorly designed CD. I feel sorry for her, she had some potential, this is a mess."
1,Loading...,"We have had this GPS for about 2 years now and when we got it, it worked well. Now for the last year the screen still says loading...for over a year now...only thing Nextar will do for you is let you ""exchange"" it for another one...for $130. Needless to say we got a Garmin now and couldn't be happier."
1,What the hell,Okay this is going to be short. This is the worst CD ever. Who are these guys rappin? They have no timing and are all off beat plus the way they rap it just makes the songs sound bad. I would be so[upset]if I was Eminem and I heard the way they mangled the songs on this CD. It's not a tribute it's an insult! No true Eminem fan would disagree.I would have gave it no stars but the form made me. All in all this CD is just sad.
1,Balanced?,"The subtitle of this book reads ""A Balanced, Comprehensive View of Abortion From Its Historical Context To The Current Debate"". What a bunch of garbage!! I am Pro-Life. I was looking for a book that FAIRLY represented both sides of abortion. This book seemed to represent this, based on the subtitle.This book is actually a very one-sided book. It talks only about repressing women, selfish males, right wing wackos, and the heroism that women have gone through to win their rights.All of this is would be fine...if the book did not represent itself as something else. Please just say that you are Pro-Choice. Don't try to deceive the reader. You do nothing to help your cause by misleading. You only disappoint."
1,San Diego Loser's Got It Right,"Ritter flip-flopped his WMD position after finding a place on Al Jazeera's payroll. Al Jazeera is openly sympathetic to Islamofascists, who aim to kill us. Ritter's arrest was not his first pedophilia-related entanglement, and it's a bit too ""black helicopter"" to think that local law enforcement sleazebag round-ups are really plots to silence political enemies."
1,Disappointing,"I wasn't interested in reading every little detail of this woman's life during this time period, but that's what I got with this book. Not very interesting. Not a great story. Maybe it would be better having read her other book (books?) first. I dunno."
1,Locks up,"Just as others have posted, it locks up 3-5 times a week. We have had this unit for 3 months and even had a couple service calls where they tried to charge us $70 to fix this piece of junk. Make sure you pay for the warranty plan if you own the HDDVR. Kind of amazing that you need to buy the warranty plan because of poor quality."
1,Not as good as they used to be,"This sound conditioner is much, much quieter than they used to be several years ago. I would not recommend it since most home noises come through even when the conditioner is turned all the way up."
1,don't waste your money,"i was looking for products in between grooming for my english bulldog and purchase fast bath thinking it'd do the trick... WRONG!!! i swear there's only alcohol and water in the bottle. it didn't leave him smelling clean and the spray hole hardly ever worked. i always ended up pouring some on a towel just to clean his paws after an outing because i didn't want to toss it in the trash after my 2nd use.....try john mitchell/paul mitchell pet cleanse....worth the money, does the job, smells clean and fresh!!!"
1,Micrwave Egg Poacher,"This is a real waste. True, it costs less than $7 delivered, but there is no way to get the yolks runny unless the whites are totally like water. Also the 4 eggs do not cook evenly. Save the money and get something better."
1,BUSTED,"In all fairness, I can't assess this item as it never worked from the getgo. It looked fine, well finished and sturdy. Unfortunately it was the last one so I could not get a replacement. I would certainly have preferred a replacement to a refund. But...c'est la vie."
1,Indigo Prophecy Review,"Ok, so this game was the best game I had ever played until about 2/3 of the way through it, then it became the worst game I had ever played. The infamous Indigo Prophecy syndrome exists, and this is where it all began...Story is excellent until the middle, and the mechanics are hard to master, but that is a good element to the game.As for buying the game? Probably not worth more than $20.00 maybe even less at this day and age.Thrilling and worth the effort to play, but looking it up on wikipedia is probably sufficient."
1,Sadly disappointed,"I grew up loving The Muppet Show and Muppet Babies. I had a lot of hope for this movie, especially given that Jason Segel was the one behind it, but I was greatly disappointed. It was dull and uninteresting and genuinely not funny. I did not want to give it 1 star, but alas, it really wasn't a good watch."
1,Good when it works.,"The buttons stopped working on mine, too, then started again. Then, files started getting corrupted so the player would freeze and I'd have to remove the battery to reboot it. I'd replace the files and different ones would cause the problem the next time. I will be buying a different mp3 player."
1,A bit too graphic,I felt the main character was flawed in ways that made me uncomfortable. The graphic sex seemed unnecessary and watching the full frontal fat naked man running down the street turned my stomach. Did I get all the subtle messages of the movie? Sure. It was a very introspective piece. Did I get all the romance about the wines and was moved? Sure. Can't help but look at wine differently after this movie. But to spice up an otherwise boring movie with sex is just pandering. The only saving grace was Sandra Ho...she is now one of my favorite actresses and I hope to see her in more things. This is one of those movies you either really love or really hate.
1,Master of the Obvious,"I was highly anticipating reading this book due to the reviews and interviews with the author on various tv shows. However, I found the advice trite and obvious. Doesn't everybody know that cleaning their office will make their work more efficient? Isn't it obvious that I should spend a balance of time between work, self and family? Such advice is insulting to an intelligent person and spirtually I found the book extremely hollow."
1,Didn't Work,"Product came in the mail promptly....and does not work at all. Literally--it won't turn on. No vibrations of any speed. Of course, it's non-returnable (even if completely unused), so it was just a complete waste of money."
1,Well now Really!,"I guess that we should hand one star over to the author for creativity, but any true Doyle fan knows that Sherlock Holmes would never marry anyone. This novel is a disgrace to literature,and I am sure the great creator of Holmes is rolling over in his grave at the thought of this almost blasphemous pastiche. Not a good read. Go find the originals.... with this you are just wasting your time."
1,The moment is gone,"I am a fan of the Feelies, but I don't like this CD. The songs are not that good, and many of them don't really go anywhere. Rocks pretty hard, however, in a Stooges sort of way. Mercer's guitar does roar. I much prefer the CD 'Shore Leave', by Yung Wu (the Feelies performing Dave Weckerman's songs).It's time to leave the Feelies legend where it belongs--in the past. Bless them."
1,Dinosaurs fall flat,"We picked up ""If the dinosaurs came back"" because of its beautiful and clear-cut illustrations. The visual impact is very enjoyable.However, the book falls short on its contents. ""If dinosaurs came back"" - yes, what if they did? In this book, their return would be very tame indeed. Dinosaurs could become buses, we learn, dinosaurs could be used as ladders, they could do timberwork in wooded areas, or people could own them like pets and take them for a stroll on a leash. But where is the dinosaur essence here? Where is the rampage, the nutsized brain, the carnivorous jaws, the giantic appetite? If dinosaurs came back, oh what happy mayhem it could be! But in this book the famed old lizards display about as much characteristics as a forgotten chair on a street corner.Verdict: Too infantile - even for the young set (ages 3 and up). But nice pictures."
1,Got hold of advance copy/disappointing,"More psuedo-intellectul swill and vicious attacks against anyone who thinks differently than dear old Annie. The defense of McCarthy is a bold statement, but if Ann could keep her pathological rage in check, it could have been a good profile of the controversial senator. Instead, Annie buries any credibility she has in hate-filled invective. More geared to the soundbite and intellectually lazy crowd as opposed to a serious character study, better luck next time, Ms. Coulter."
1,Dangerous!,"Be prudent. It is a dangerous concoction. The fumes can give a soar throat, swollen glands, and you might not get the smell out of your nose for a few days. It needs warning labels, and testing."
1,Big Disappointment!,"After hearing Jennifer Lopez's new single ""Jenny From The Block"", I had expected her new c.d. to be filled with cool and catchy songs like that. So I decided to check it out. It was just a big let-down. The only reason I rated it two stars was because of the song ""Jenny From The Block"". All the other songs are slooooow and syrupy. I'm not a big fan of slow ballads and songs, and I liked Jennifer's second c.d. better. Hopefully she will put out a better CD next time!"
1,"Cheaply made, poor fitting","The case itself is fine, it's just the all important slip strap that was cut a bit too wide to slide into the loop to close the case. You can try jamming it in, but why? It should just fit, no matter what the price. Particularly since this is a Palm product, I was counting on better quality than this."
1,not as i expected,i think i expected more since previous reviews have said this product was a 5 star. i was not impressed with the quality. i don't know if i would get a better product if i were to order direct from royal albert
1,No more Creative for me,Had this for 7 months. Kept it in excellent condition but after 7 months it crapped out. I had to pay shipping and deposit $20 with Creative to have them look at it. They told me it was a bad circuit board and it would cost me $125 to fix it. I told them to keep the $300 paperweight. Then 2 weeks later they call and ask me if it is correct that someone (I assume inside Creative) authorized to charge my account to fix it. I told them that if I see any charges on my account I will contact Better Business Bureau. I used to swear by Creative products. Now I just swear AT them.
1,Not worth it.,"I bought this book based on all the glowing recommendations I've seen in the reviews of best-sellers, so I decided to purchase it. Well, that was my first mistake. This book supplies a lot of useless information. It says the color of your eyes can deterimine your future health. It requires you use enemas daily, and drink lemon juice. This book should have been called the carnival folk's guide to snake oil. That is all this book is. I returned my book for a full refund, I'd suggest you do the same if you were among the unlucky to have bought it, If you were not so unlucky and haven't yet bought it, DON'T."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"I bought this sharpener for my kids to use at home. We tried it a couple of times but it never sharpened a pencil evenly (wood all up one side so you can't write with it), it is really noisy, and vibrates a lot. It really feels like a bargain basement electric sharpener. I returned it and bought a Westcott iPoint Electric Pencil Sharpener which works so much better and is far less noisy."
1,Are you listening to the same CD I am ?,"This is POP music. This is not Rock & Roll ... nor are they the saviours of the american music scene -- that is a hard burden to carry by anyone. Truth -- They are rich kids. Truth -- their songs sound unoriginal compared let's say to the White Stripes, The Warlocks or even Vax Wallo. I am not a music snob -- I just call them like I see them.The american music scene is alive an well living in the underbelly of your cities. Detroit, Chicago, L.A., NY Austin, Seattle .. but please don't give mumbo jumbo about this band. The Strokes only accolade should be is that the true Musicians/artist will shine through the fog they emitted.""A sucker is born every minute"""
1,I returned it,"Out of the box this item felt flimsy. It wouldn't connect and the charging base wouldn't charge. The wires connecting the base to the computer would make the light flicker if touched very lightly. The trickle charger that connects the mouse to the computer didn't work either and would also make the light on it flicker if touched lightly. The software that it came with didn't run on Vista, so I had to download them from manufactures site. When I called the company I had to leave a message for them to call me back, and they never did.I returned it and got my money back."
1,McBain's Out Of Ideas On This One,"Have you ever seen the Jumping the Shark website? It's dedicated to TV shows that have gone downhill, and the site invited viewers to pinpoint the exact moment that a show ""Jumped The Shark""...the phrase comes from an episode of 'Happy Days'. Well, Ed's ""Jumped The Shark"" with this one. Any police/crime novel where the author has to rely on an ultra-clever, supernaturally mysterious archnemesis with no name (a la James Bond), well, you know he's out of good plot ideas. And, unfortunately, ol' Ed's spent too much time in this book detailing the sexual exploits of various characters, with said detail contributing little if anything to the story.Do yourself a favor - stick with Ed's earlier stuff - it's a treat. ""Eight Black Horses"" is a throwaway."
1,UTTER GARBAGE,"Not much to say, hardly anything like the real story, if you want to delve into a more frightning charles manson story, read Vincent Bugliosi's book ""Helter Skelter"" that's TRUE terror."
1,I hated this film.,"I really wanted to like this film, as I love gay cinema. But the bad acting, horrible script and horrific directing made me hate it. And LONG! It's bad enough when a movie ""seems"" to drag on because it's so bad. Well, this movie is worse as it is BAD and clocks in at just under 2 hours. This film makes ""The Titanic"" seem like a short. This could have been such a great little film too. But it is just too tedious and too poorly executed to qualify for even a movie to fall asleep to. ""Attack of the killer tomatoes"" seems like an oscar winner compared to this stinker.If you want to see a great gay themed movie, skip this trash and go rent ""Edge of seventeen"" or ""Trick.""I am not kidding, this film is alful."
1,defective spout,Can't really evaluate the product itself because ease of use is impaired by the fact that the cream will not emit from the push spout. It is annoying and wasteful to dump more than is necessary for one facial application into one's hand. Can you have the manufacturer replace this vial ? It's a shame to have the faulty delivery device impact the product when so many other purveyors get it right.
1,what a load of garbage!! quite laughable,"first of all, the grammer and structure are horrendous, as are the many undocumented sources (bogus/twisted ""facts""). its quite obvious to me that this sad and empty woman has just written this book (with no background or knowlegde of eating disorders or what struggles the patients have gone thru) to grasp a moment in the spotlight for herself. peggy claude-pierre has designated her life to educate and save as many people as she can. its so disgraceful that ms mclintock has ruined opportunities and hope for many potential patients by writing this book. in following the trials and triumphs of the clinic it is obvious to me that this woman went out of her way to seek out the negative and misinterpreted situations rather then researching and learning about what really goes on there. (sounds like she could use some serioius therapy and sore searching herself!)"
1,Yawner,Overly indulgent tale of a rehab girl who attends her sister's wedding and creates A LOT of non needed drama. I got through about 40 minutes before I puked all over the T.V. MY GRADE: D plus
1,Below average collection of nonsense,"Self-appointed knowledge holder of metal, Martin Popoff has put together a compilation of reviews which neither satisfy the information/ trivia gland nor offer any insight into the world of heavy metal.While the reviews are way more subjective than natural, the abundance of factual mistakes/ omissions from discography, and worst of all the incomplete nature of this half book render this nonsense redundant.A bunch of review (akin to owning 10 issues of ANY magazine), put to book by an author whose passion is clearly not metal and who seemingly is out to make fast buck.The author, however, attempts to mask his lack of any clue about the genre with the adaption of big dictionary words reminiscent of the habits of grade school girls out to impress their teachers.Incomplete, misleading and poor will sum this one up..."
1,Look elsewhere,"I have two major complaints about this product. Firstly, the grinder is ""preset to a medium grind"". Well, I found it to be much coarser than the way I do it in my grinder so I have to use almost twice as many beans to get the same strength brew. At $11.99 per pound, that is not a good thing so I now disable the grind function and do it myself just like before. Secondly, the coffee doesn't get hot enough, even when using the heat-boosting ""1-4 Cup"" button. I have $150 coffeemaker and yet I grind my own beans and then have to microwave my coffee before drinking it. Thumbs down."
1,An Awful Reading Experience,"Ms. Shupack did not give her characters depth. The story line went nowhere. The book was very disjointed and hard to follow. There was no sense of connecting with characters, places or events. There was no imagery. Forty pages into the book I was still giving it the benefit of the doubt thinking it was just a slow start. By page 100 it was agony. My book club unanimously deemed it 'the worst book' ever."
1,Disappointing,"I had high expectations regarding this book! However, I was totally turned off by it. Most women I have talked to at least liked being pregnant (some even LOVED it), but obviously this woman was not one of them. If you like to complain or listen to people complain, this book is for you! I appreciated the lists of things to bring to the hospital and suggestions regarding what products were helpful, but found the negative comments tiresome (such as the one suggesting exercise outside where there aren't any mirrors). I received WHAT TO EXPECT WHEN YOU ARE EXPECTING from my OB/GYN. It was a breath of fresh air after this book. As it turns out, my first pregnancy ended in miscarriage, but WHAT TO EXPECT had an entire section on when things go wrong, unlike the Girlfriends' Guide. I tossed the Girlfriends' Guide and have What to Expect in my bookshelf for future reference. Once you are on a hormonal roller coaster, the Girlfriends' Guide loses its charm rather quickly."
1,3 hours before breaking is not a good sign,"I ordered this from Southeast Clearance Consolidators and the unit only managed to work for the first 3 hours before it started to make that foreboding clicking sound and stopped moving. Eventually it would not roll or massage at all.While the massager was disappointing, the service from Southeast Clearance Consolidators was refreshing. In spite of their published policy of allowing 14 days to return the product or else you have to seek redress from the manufacturer, the president promptly responded to each email I sent. In the end, he helped me find a place to which I could send the unit for repair and credited my CC to cover the shipping charges. Great service!"
1,not what expected,"Although the songs and the pictures are nice, the toy doesn't have on/off button. So if you press the happy frog in the middle of the night - there is no way to stop that cheerful song. Also the flaps are kind of hard to open even for adult. And it is still too bulky for my 5 months old. She would love to chew on it but gets frustrated because is the base is too big and it's difficult to get a good grip on the pages."
1,Worked good until the Xbox Slim came along!,"This was Perfect before the slim came along, do not buy it now! Its considered outdated technology. Do not buy unless everyone you know has an older model xbox"
1,Am I reading the same book as the rest of the reviewers?!?,"Neither funny nor brilliant as the reviews on the cover shout out. White Noise is essentially the work of an author who is trying to be thoughful, witty and cool; none of which you can try to be. You either are or you aren't, and as far as I can tell, DeLillo isn't. His dialogue reads like the conversations between the uber-pretentious art-punks I used to know in high school, and the characters are about as real as the art-punks' hair color. I suppose this is a good thing, as I would probably want to punch anybody that acted like these characters if I met them in the real world.It didn't make me laugh, it didn't make me think (at least nothing outside of, ""Christ, 73 more pages...""). The only reason I finished the book was so I wouldn't feel as if I had thrown away my money. Don't throw away your money, find another book instead."
1,hahahahahahaha,"the offspring on this album(by the way i never even liked the old epitaph stuff just so you know)took the sugar ray route in music making. for some punk bands that care about their fans go listen to bands like the clash,stiff little fingers,sham 69,chelsea,the exploited,dropkick murphy's,rancid(don't ever compare them to the offspring),the damned,the casualties,anti-flag,misfits,blanks 77 and tons more.-jason harshman"
1,Yuck,"This is a review of the audio book...I couldn't get past CD 2. The protagonist/narrator is so impressed with herself, her intellect, and her physical appearance I couldn't stand it. The book seems written for the most indiscriminate and easily impressed of readers. When Temperance (or somebody else) quoted Jerry McGuire ""show me the money"", (gee, that's original) I was through. The rambling plot is very typical of the genre and the characters with whom we should sympathize are obnoxious. The TV character is much more interesting...the brilliant Temperance on television is often socially inappropriate, which makes her interesting and kind of endearing, the Temperance in this book is just kind of snarky and self-satisfied."
1,X - tremely disappointing,This was nowhere as good as the TV show. It was overlong and boring. It very nearly put me off the show.
1,Will I ever learn?,"I've never written a review before but this was such a waste of money I felt compelled. The reviewer before had it exactly - someone set up a camera and left it on. The only way I could tell there was motion (on most of the shots) was to speed it up to 16x or more. If it had been all just waves, that might have been ok. But 10 minutes of a single flower slightly swaying in the breeze...which could have been filmed anywhere...SAVE YOUR MONEY!! You can HAVE my copy since I won't ever use it again."
1,Baby Signs,"Interesting theory. The parents I know who use baby signs have done so because their children are ""late"" talkers. I may be more convinced that Baby Signs helps children become better communicators if I had run across children who had decent vocabularies & whose parents signed to them when they were younger. Unfortunately I've seen parents use this as a crutch for 2- 2 1/2 year olds who aren't talking. So I guess it has it's place."
1,"I haven't even read it, how should I know?","I hope it's good, cause I read the others, but I hope K.A. eases up on gross stuff."
1,Water Treatment System,"The delivery on this product took way to long, and after calling to get the tracking #, I was given the run around. Also, I bought one from Costco in the past and they provide 2 pitchers, Amazon only provided one and the price went up over 30%."
1,B-O-R-I-N-G,"Oh my gosh, I have no idea whats the big deal with this movie. I was bored to death on the whole movie. The fights looks so fake and the acting is even worst. The special effects are v good but thats all I found interesting. The big finale lacked passion in my opinion and wasnt that clear either. I guess Im gonna get yelled here for saying all this but trust me, Ive seen lots & lots of movies & Ive seen movies with way lower budget much better than this. Thanks Gosh its over."
1,A Great Hook for Ally Fans,I bought this book for my boyfriend who is in love with Ally. He loves looking at the pictures. Enough said.
1,How in the blazes...,"this girl has gotten to be such a star is beyond me! Her voice grates on the nerves like fingernails on a chalkboard, and I quit a job I liked because they kept playing her music! UGH."
1,It works?,"Sometimes it will not bring me a picture when it is hook up. They have a loose fit with all my HD product (TV, Bluray,PS 3) I have to wiggle the ends to get it to work, and sometimes it work and sometimes it doesnt. I will not buy this product again"
1,Not Superior.,"The Jasmine flavor is VERY weak, and the amount of pearls represents a very low value for the amount of money paid to the quantity of product received. A couple of days worth of product."
1,Poor Quality,"This monitor worked well for the first three months. It became erratic so I changed the battery, it woked perfectly for two days, then stopped woking again. Not worth the money."
1,Not good for REAL beginners,This book is totally useless to someone who doesn't already know server basics.
1,The Silly Dead,"If your looking for scares and shocks from this movie you won't get them. Well there's a few. The Film opens the same way the first evildead movie did (why would Ash go back to the same house, snd takehis new girlfriend??). anyway soon she becomes possessed,poor Ash is minus another girlfriend to the deadites.Ok I'll cut to the chase theres some cool scenes, The one where hisheadless girlfriend is chasing him around the woodshed with a chainsaw. The other few scenes I liked was when Ash's hand becomes possessed by his girlfriends head. (It fallls in his lap) she bites him and he goes nuts trying to get it off.soon he lops it off and it starts running around the house but notbefore it beat's [up] Ash. Man he's got staminaOtherwise It was a dissapointment to me"
1,Whahuh?,"This isn,t a bad book, but I really expected a tale involving a lot of different undead types, and instead I found the group was facing little more than a Wight. No offense, but there a plenty scarier undead to choose from than wights. The tale isn't bad and some of the characters are fun, but the story is rushed, told in well under 300 pages. Had I known I was paying six bucks for a book under three hundred pages I would have thought twice before making a purchase. As it is, I will say away from TH Lain's Penny Dreadfuls that cost a dollar. Definately a throw away tale, as I read this a month ago and cannot recall a single character's name.Not a bad read, just not worth the cover. 2 stars for shortness of story and forgettable characters."
1,Avoid,"Ok.. where to start on this one, first off on day one I received the thermometer the probe was DOA, all I was getting was an error anytime I tried to use it. Now they back order these probes, so it took me 2 MONTHS to get a new one. And yes, at first I was very happy, but after a while I started realizing that it's not giving me the proper temps, and there's no convinent button to press that automatically gives you the current temp. There's a tiny one on the back that requires a pen to press, but that's no good. So it updates it's temp every few seconds, but sometimes it wouldn't so what your reading on screen could be completely different from what it actually is. So I don't use it anymore, because it does not provide quick accurate information."
1,WHEN COMPARED TO HER FIRST GREATEST HITS PACKAGE...,This one is like a hot dog when you're really wanting steak!! Just terrible!
1,P. U.,"Loved Dawn/Day of the Dead. I even loved Zombie. I greatly looked forward to Zombie 3. But this movie was ATROCIOUS. One minute you have the traditional slow moving zombie, next minute they are jumping of roofs and talking! No plot. No continuity. This movie was just plain bad. Stay away from this steaming pile of crap"
1,Little bit disappointed...,"I was over sea having 5 years old son, who was a bit out of control. I looked for help in this book. Well, I guess working with children, nothing is easy and simple, there isn't one answer what to do to correct child behavior. Coming back to United State, his behavior got much better, I guess being in the different country, away from home, it created large amount of stress on him to miss behave. It's good book, but have lot of work to do."
1,40% Polyester,"I needed a cool, 100%-cotton T-shirt to wear while working out. That's how Amazon described this product: 100% cotton. But what I received is 40% polyester---much too warm for workouts.Be careful when shopping from Amazon's Hanes T-shirt page. It's convenient because it presents T-shirts in a wide range of colors, in various fabrics, and from various vendors. But this multiplicity of options increases the risk of ending up a product different from the one you selected online._ _ _ _ _In looking over earlier reviews, I see that other customers have had the same problem. Perhaps Amazon and its vendors think customers don't really care whether a T-shirt is 100% cotton or 40% polyester. If you care, beware!"
1,Not that great,"Two major dislikes:* The body heat/motion detection is too sensitive to use with as a snooze ""button"".* I am a heavy sleeper and the alarm is waaaaay to quiet to wake me up - this was the reason I had to return it.Also, the front of mine was not assembled correctly at the factory which made the minutes very hard to read.Likes:* The auto-lamp is an excellent idea.* I liked the fact it set the time itself."
1,wrong size!,The large says 9 - 12. Amazon send me 12 - 15. This socks are for giants. I hope Amazon will fix this problem.
1,Worthless,"Same issues as many others here. Non-stick surface sticks and is too easily damaged. Uneven heat. Worst is the design of the controller connection. Worked fine the first few times, but now works only intermittently because the controller loses contact, effectively turning off the heat. Worthless."
1,"Poor setup, poor link quality, terrible documentation","I've had my DI-713p for a couple weeks now, and it has yet to impress me. I had numerous problems during installation--none of which were covered adequately in the manual's troubleshooting section--and still have yet to get encryption working properly. Once I did finally get the network working, I tried my computer upstairs (I have a small two-story house), and the link quality and throughput were both terrible. This is the only wireless router I've tried, so I can't really say how it compares up against the others, but I wouldn't recommend this router to anybody. If you do buy it, for whatever reason, make very sure you get the firmware upgrade (which itself is a major challenge to track down on dlink's site) or you'll end up with random lock-ups."
1,Crap,"This video contains out-dated material and clear propaganda especially as it relates to environmental matters. I don't know who ""Enduring Freedom Productions"" is but they should be ashamed of themselves for packaging old material with ""new topics"" which amount to no more than half baked rehashed news reports. Enduring Freedom, lose the theme song and be assured, you fooled me once; it won't happen again."
1,Parts fall apart in a short time,"I bought 2 of these. The handles started coming apart as soon as I started using them. They were just press fitted together, so I pulled them apart and applied some glue and that problem was solved. I thought about writing a bad review then, but figured the problem was easily solved, so I didn't. However, this summer the pump assemblies on both have fallen apart. This is a very poorly made product. I have had no luck with gilmour products. I've seen early failure in their hoses, hose sprayers, watering timers, lawn sprinklers, and now tank sprayers. They are the brand that is available at most hardware and home improvement stores, so everybody ends up with some of their products. I can't vouch for any other brand, but am going to start searching for one that doesn't so consistently disappoint."
1,Too general to be truly useful,"This book introduces you to overall concepts related to programming, and thus may be useful as a secondary text or as a general introduction to ""issues you'll encounter when you actually start programming""...but as a primary guide, it didn't do much to help me get started. Having used this book, I'm now more familiar with terms and ideas and, to some extent, the lay of the programming land, but I still need a book that functions more like a text book: let's start at the beginning and get you writing some basic programs...not just talk about concepts in generalities."
1,what a disgrace to sonic,"sonic genesis is a god awful piece of somthing! if it's not the glitches killing you, it' somthing else. the collision detection is bad, the slow frame rate's worse, and to top it off, the game music is INSANE! the music is so awful to listen to, it makes you want to rip you ear drums out! it makes me cry knowing this is based off the genesis oringinal. this is celebrating the original game's 15th annaversary? wow sega, you must hate sonic. i can't believe you're tring to con people out of their hard earned money for this insult! and what's worse, you're tring to pass this off as the original? WTF?!"
1,Worst Pads Ever,"As soon as you pick up one of these pads, the cardboard rips off. Seriously, these are the worst pads ever made. I simply threw out the whole bunch."
1,More like what MacGyver wouldn't do!,"First I'll start off by saying I love the show, still watch it and own the DVDs. While reading some of the stories, I could see MacGyver doing, most are garbage. For instace one of the stories involves a tailpip/muffler breaking, and being solved by someone else fixing it. Really I so remember Mac reliing on the kindness of strangers to get him out of a jam. Given most of the stories a writen by pros, they try to come off as being witty and smart where anyone with common sese could pull off what they did with no second thought to it."
1,The Worst Bond Film...EVER!,"This film is such an embarassment to the James Bond series, I can't even bring myself to watch it. First of all, Roger Moore looks OLD as heck in this film! His last film as Bond should have been ""For Your Eyes Only"", which is his best performance as Bond. Tanya Roberts (Stacey) is the most annoying Bond girl of all time and not at all believable as a California's state geologist and a businesswoman. Every time it comes to a fight or some action she cowers and whimpers, yelling `Help me James' at the top of her shrill voice, and spends most of the time as some sort of damsel in distress for Bond to save.The only good thing about this movie is Christopher Walken plays a great villian and its good to see the great Patrick Macnee on screen again. Also, the title song by Duran Duran is awesome too. Other than that, this movie is lame. Watch if you must!"
1,poor quality,"The hinge broke after a few uses. There are 2 flimsy hinge pins. The first hinge pin broke almost immediately. We continued to use the maker with remaining pin hinge although the lid was loose and didn't sit well. After a couple of months, the second hinge pin broke making the appliance useless."
1,Don't bother,I just tried to finish this book and absolutely could not. The first 10 pages are the best. Do not buy this book or even bother to check it out at the library.
1,Not for me....,"I rented this DVD with my ex. Of course, it was more of his kind of mobie than mine because it's a ""guy movie"". Anyway, I thought that there'd be more action and more cars. However, I was disappointed. The plot (but then again, who cared about the plot?) was flat and the characters (except Letty) were pretty weak and fake. Overall, I fell asleep towards the end of the movie."
1,Mr. Dibbell could use a life....,"""My Tiny Life"" about sums it up. Julian Dibble is, literally, what the British term ""a wanker."" He brings navel gazing to an exhaulted pinnacle. He starts his book well, discussing the strange interactions between real life (RL) and virtual life as experienced on MUDs and MOOs (VL). He almost captures your imagination, then loses it all in a prolix tale of his adventures in masturbation, both real and virtual. In part, the book reads like his paeon of love to the (current) woman he has trouble making a committment to. In part, it's a waltz through the lives of people who are not yet ready to engage in real life and instead are tooling around virtual reality trying to get a grip on, primarily, their sexuality. While this book will surely appeal to those who recognize themselves in it, it's actually rather repellant to those who have been there, done that, then grew up."
1,bad quality,"rented hd , have fios connection 25/15 always stream good hd, but lately amazon's quality has been droppn down to below sd quality, when i paid more money to watch hdi know its not my connection, amazon you need to fix whatever it is dropping hd quality out"
1,Could be longer,Bought game for grandson because he saw demo in store. I should have rented the game before I bought it for him. He enjoyed the game 100%. He defeated the game to the end by day 3. He loves games and has a natural knack for playing them. I forgot to look and see if it had enough memory to be worth the buy. Boys like farting and stinky things and he commented to me that I would not like that part but it made him laugh often.
1,should have listened to the other reviewers,the item arrived with the back right corner broken on EVERY one of the plastic cases. It's hard to see how it happened in shipment considering they were in the rack. I did get a return label quickly to send it back but I ordered this online so I wouldn't have to run out and get it. Packaging it and taking it to the post office is more effort than going to buy it locally. Don't buy it.
1,I Hated This Book!,"I picked this up from a friend. She thought that I might be interested because of my knowledge of the Catholic Church and a passing interest in science fiction. I Hated This Book! Characters are introduced, developed, and dismissed - dying almost off stage. There is inexplicable brutality and chaotic leaps of faith. I cannot think of a book that I liked less. I forced myself to finish The Sparrow assuming that there would be some redemptive conclusion. I was sadly wrong. I cannot discourage you strongly enough to avoid this book. I have no idea why it gained a measure of success and popularity. It is not good science fiction. It is not interesting ethically, philosophically, or theologically. I did not find it to be particularly well-written."
1,HIghly DIsappointed,"I purchased this product based on the great reviews on Amazon. Unfortunatley, this product didn't work at all. I tried to vacuum my pool yesterday, and it wouldn't even stay completely on the floor of the pool. It seems as though one side was always slightly elevated. It did not pick up any of the dirt that was on the floor of the pool, however it did get a few leaves up. This is a piece of junk and is going right back to where it came from. Not sure why anyone would rave about this piece of junk."
1,It doesn't look like the picture,"I ordered 2, took longer than expected. It doesn't look like the picture. The inside of mine look like a cheap plastic. The outside is not silver its gold."
1,Not history.,"There is nothing worse than zealots who set out to bamboozle people in order to make a buck and promote a lie. What a bunch of garbage! Barton and Pevoto should be ashamed of their actions, but, of course, they have no shame. Everyone has access to a computer, so do a little basic research before wasting your money on something this insulting to American history and our founding fathers."
1,NO GOOD!,"Of course Aretha could never really record a bad album but this one smacks a little of record company ""let's take them for all they've got"" motives. The sound quality is that of a demo-tape from the fifties and there is absolutely nothing gained from buying this album rather than any other more modern one. Aretha started great and remained consistent so anything she recorded later is better than this. I recommend any of the compilations from the seventies."
1,Too anti public schools for me,"While the author points up what must be problems in the public schools, he never lets up. He is too anti public schools for my blood. I read a little over half of it, and I put it down. Didn't need that much negativism. A little lighter would have been better."
1,Very slow shipping,The book I ordered was a gift. I am sure they will enjoy reading it but it took a very long time to get here. Disappointed in that!
1,Strangely Disappointed,"I have listened to the CD over and over - it is missing something. I like Devil's Pie, Untitled and Africa cuts, but the rest of the CD loses me. I was prepared to love this CD - Brown Sugar and his live import are wonderful - but I'm afraid I can't."
1,Do not purchase,"I order this one, thinking it was 12 hours and 2 double disks DVD like it shows in the photo. What I recieved is one that has only one DVD with 5 hours instead of 12 hours. Guess I should have read the details, but it still doesn't explain why the photo of the cover is not the same one I received.Please see the dicussions in the telenovela community, most telenovelas are 8-12 hours, this is 5 hours. Yes I watched it and there are too many holes for me to even fill-in. I own over 100 telenovelas, there others that have better content and quality."
1,Exterminated dinosaur trying to go back to power,"Thinking about Pahlavis going back to Iran is like thinking about Romanovs to become the Tsars of Russia again. Nobody forgets the dictatorship of Reza Pahlavi's father. Totalitarianism of Islamic Republic regime does not justify going back in the history to revive the dead body of monarchy in Iran. For Iranians the name Pahlavi doesn't mean any thing more than a word like Qajar: These are exterminated dinosaurs who are interesting to watch but nobody wants them back in power again.Iran is a republic and it stays a republic, with or without the word ""Islamic"". Reza Pahlavi should forget about becoming a king in Iran and do his own business in America. Pahlavi family is a part of history for Iranians, ... and I have to say a dark part of it."
1,What happened to the Scouts?,I'm surprised it did not mention not to use the book as tinder for a fire because of the greenhouse gasses it might create.
1,Non-biblical creationist defend Deistic god of the old earth,"These compromisers are in their approach and assumptions. The bottom line is that they is falling into the trap that God warns about in Proverbs 26:4! Which reads: ""Answer NOT a fool according to his folly, lest thou also be like unto him."" God warns that we are NOT to answer the FOOL (an person that rejects God and/or His Word) according to their folly! However, in their ""defense"" of Genesis, they bases their arguments on the FOOL's own assumptions. In other words, they accepts & work from the fools own false presuppositions and unbiblical paradigm to base his answers. In so doing, they ends up with the same conclusions a the fools they are debating. The only difference is that they say there is god, and their opponents will either agree that there is a god or not. That is why he is ""like unto them,"" and not giving a good apologetic for the faith"
1,Good for 1 year,"Our neighbors had this monitor, at the time, their child was less than 1 year old. They recommended to us. We bought it. When our neighbor's child was about a year old, they told us they had to throw theirs out and get a new one because everytime they touched the dial it created really loud static. Ours was fine. Then, we had ours for about a year and the same thing started happening to us. Moving the volume control on the receiver caused really loud static. Being somewhat mechanically inclined, I opened it up and blew compressed air on the volume control contacts. Put it back together and the static was gone! However, I have to repeat this process about once per week to keep the static from coming back. We are about to look for a new brand of monitor. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT if you plan to use is for more than a year. It really did work great for the first year, but it should last more than a year!"
1,Not happy with Author's Suggestions,"This book may be fine for Divorced persons, who have lost their spouse due to marital disharmony, however the lost spouse is not deceased, but still living. My experience of losing a spouse that I had lived with for half a century, who was my closest and best friend, never to see them again doesn't compare the despair of a divorced person. Many divorced persons find it difficult to remember anything positive about their former spouse. I on the other hand find it impossible to recall anything negative about my late spouse, even though the author wants me to make a graph showing at least two negative events. Further, that if one doesn't, they are ""enshrining"" the lost one. I don't know if the author has experienced the death of his spouse, as has the author of a grief book I later read, where the author finds more humanistic ways to lessen grief. This later book, ""Finding Your Way After Your Spouse Dies"" by Marta Felber I found very helpful."
1,slow going,"I'm glad I've read it, now that it's over, for the book provided many interesting historical details; however, as fiction it is less than first rate, particularly because of the slow pacing. I think 3/4 of the book was over before the characters ever made it to Australia. Also, the main character, Richard Morgan, did not have as much depth or complexity as I would have liked; at times he seemed to be too perfect, to have risen to a position of leadership and sustained good judgment too easily or quickly. Still, there were many fascinating details in the story."
1,Will not do for a rugged environment.,"Mikasa volleyball lasted for less than a month of daily hard playing in a rugged environment. Luckily they were affordable and I purchased 2 at the same time, not sure of the quality. Should be fine for back yard use."
1,too many software glitches,"I have had two of these phones. I sent the first one back to T-Mobile after it kept freezing on me (just like a computer freezes) and they gave me a refurbished unit in exchange. Unfortunately, the second one is only marginally better - it also freezes frequently (1-2 times per week) and sometimes the only way to reset it is to take out the battery and restart it. This phone has nice bells and whistles, but they don't mean much if the phone is so damn unreliable."
1,A total failure,"I got this converter just today from amazon and its probably the worst product that i have ever got. The moment i switched it on, i realized the fuse had to be replaced. When i replaced the fuse and plugged it with a 240 volt cooker, there were fumes all over the room. I would not recommend this unauthentic product. It was mere waste of 35 USD."
1,A Self-indulgent Work of Average Intelegence,"After being told that this book was wonderful, beautiful, and lived up to its title I was disapointed. That being said, the author did warn us about this in the labouriously written intro. At the end I found that there were parts of the book that I looked back on fondly but in general I think much of the praise for this novel-ish book to be unfounded."
1,Poor quality basket,"I am very disappointed with this basket. It is very poor quality and falling apart. The ""stain"" used actually makes the basket orange. Not a natural wood color at all. Nothing like what is pictured."
1,Prepare to replace regularly,Our son is 11 months and we have bought about 10 of these. They are great and portable for travel but short out after 1 - 3 months for us. This means our son wakes up screaming when it turns off at 4am. I'm fed up and now spending the money on a better one.
1,Ugh. :(,"I loved some of the humor in this movie, even though from all outward appearances (previews, etc.), it seemed to me they were trying to make a serious movie. I thought Kate and Hugh played their parts well, as did their Friar friend. BUT, the movie bordered on unwatchable for the most part.The beginning was so corny and campy that I immediately wanted to give up watching it. Every part of the film that contains Dracula is poorly acted and murderous to sit through.Some of the special effects were spectacular, and some were so poorly executed that it made me wonder if I was watching the same film from 5 minutes before.The movie skitters about with no real purpose. A mishmash of characters are thrown in to try and keep things interesting, and it succeeds about half the time. I fell asleep trying to finish the last 10 minutes of the movie, and don't plan to re-watch. I was really hoping it would live up to the previews. I had high hopes for this movie."
1,Poor product - does not work on Jeep Wrangler Sport,"If you own a Jeep Wrangler Sport 2004, please do not buy Dorman 689-200. It does not fit.Poor workmanship!"
1,Far too overpriced for this length!! You shouldn't spend more than $10,"Much like the previous reviewer I urge you not to spend lots of money on HDMI cables. HDMI specs state that only one pixel out of every billion can be lost, therefore there is no reason, no matter what the cable is made of, to spend money on HDMI cables.Search the internet, you can find plenty of good 10ft HDMI cables for $10 or less.Digital is zeroes and ones. In HDMI's case, either the cable is connected or it isn't."
1,Somewhat disappointing,"I was surprised this was a choice for Oprah's Book Club. I have read some of her other recommendations and been completely entertained. I expected the same with The Pilot's Wife.I felt the characters should have been more developed. Kathryn's husband has been married for five years to another woman and she didn't have a clue? Didn't she ever need to call him at the crew apartment before? Whatever happened to a woman's intuition? It was a little frustrating to follow the plot from past to present, but the most frustrating for me was the ending. Did I miss something?I did read it in two days because I kept thinking it would get better, but it didn't. I would give the author another chance however. Not every literary attempt can be a huge success."
1,Completely Overated,"So I bought this cd, hearing all the hype about this band. I bought this cd instead of the new best of MArilyn Manson cd. God I hate myself for doing that. This band sounds like a nu-metal crap version of evanescense, not saying they are good either. The singer sounds like most other females in metal. The same operaatic ""singing"" voice. The backup singer is horrible. Again his voice reeks of nu-metallitis. She only has one tone to her voice, she doesnt have a versatile voice at all. Versatile e.g. danni filth. I listened to this cd once and is now stored in the back of my cd collection. I smashed the cd case over my head."
1,You have GOT to be kiddin' me,"$20 a month for a incompleat e-Newspaper? I don't care if it IS the NY Times, it's called a rip in my book."
1,Wasn't very good for me...,"I didn't have very good results with this antenna, but I haven't had better results than with the simple telescoping antenna that came with my set.I expected a little better based on the strength of the reviews but not real surprised when it wasn't.Back to my original antenna."
1,Disappointed...,"I reserved this book at the library extremely anxious to read the contents since I try to regularly watch the show; unfortunately, I was horribly disappointed. Pretty much everything in the book drew from the episodes in their shows which I had already seen. Halfway through the book, I started to skim because I didn't see any point to what was being written. If I had never watched the show it would've been a better read, but if you watch the show regularly skip this book."
1,Damaged item.,"This item was damaged when I revived it. The case was chipped and broken. I was very upset as I was excited to receive this series as I have been a long time fan of it. An exchange was not allowed, only a refund. I was refunded the full amount I paid."
1,"Works, but is Way OVERPRICED","It works, but does not allow my 1/4"" plug to penetrate to the full depth that other female receptacles do. Worse, I paid over $12 with shipping and could have purchased other adapters for a small fraction of the price."
1,Very very disappointing,"I bought these rotors in Nov 08, full set front and rear for my 02 F150 4WD truck, I had these on for a few months then began hearing an annoying sound every time I drove slowly and had to apply the brakes (also installed the recommended green-stuff EBC ceramic pads). I decided to take my truck to the brake mechanic after becoming overly- annoyed, only to find out that the front left side rotor had a nice full circular grove about 1/8"" deep on the inside of it and the pad showed the raised area where the groove was made. I became very disappointed not to mention amazed as was the mechanic at my mis-fortunes for these rotors appeared to be virtually indestructible according to the product specs and the fact that these cannot be machined and r not available individually, I am now left with a wasted, useless set of rotors....well at least I didn't throw the box away......very very disappointing."
1,"Definitely not ""A Fine Balance""","Having picked up and put back this book many times over the past year, I finally caved in and read it to see what all the raves were about. My worst fears were confirmed. This is a highly overrated, soap-operatic, flatly written melodrama whose only ticket to success was having been written in English by an Afghani writer. Affirmative action at its worst. There are other reviewers among the hundreds here who have articulated the book's many failings - I encourage prospective readers to look at those first. Skip past the five-star reviews and find those who see this as I do. One laudatory review even compared this to Rohinton Mistry's ""A Fine Balance."" Not by a long shot. Kite Runner is definitely not on par with that masterwork from a much more skilled writer. Not the worst book out there, simply the most undeserving of such lavish accolades."
1,Disappointed,Description indicates this is a color edition which I have been looking for. The picture on the front of the box is in color but the DVD is in B/W
1,bad paper quality.,"I bought this as one of my collection of Classics. Everyone knows that the novel itself deserves a five star. However, the poor paper quality does not match the quality of the content."
1,Clearly Politically Motivated,"As usual some italians never miss a chance to complain and bash about things they either don't have or don't understand. Clearly the author has been living in the stone age far too long. What does he mean with ""How many people have actually ever bought an airline ticket over the internet?"". Probably every single person I know! Or ""How many people have actually ever sent data over the internet?"". Practically the entire US population! His observations are not only shallow and over analyzed, most of them are just not accurate. Further, he fails to capture the true underlying issues embedded in the American way of life. The social and cultural issues that are ripping this country apart. A very poor analysis of non-issues that are, for the most part, just a result of his ignorance. His arrogance. Money NOT well spent I must say. P.S. I am an Italian living in the US."
1,Silpat,Silpat is non-stick the first time you use it. After that it is no different than any other surface despite the advertising.
1,A Lesson Learned,"After looking forward to the remake of one of my favorite films, I was totally disappointed. However, I did learn a valuable lesson. Newer is not always better, sometimes a lot worse. This movie was wanting in every aspect. From special effects that weren't really needed, limited dialogue, poor casting, etc., etc. If you must see it, try the library and spend your cash on something else. On the positive side, a copy of the original movie is included."
1,It can not clean my baby!,"This is the first time I try Seventh Generation products. I am very disappointed. The wipe is soft, and has enough moisture. However, it can not clean my son's butt. Every time I have to use so many wipes to clean him!"
1,CAT cd is what you'll get,"My bunnies loved the old Rabbit cd. Which is why I wanted another one since it seems to be lost somewhere. Sadly, even though I ordered the Rabbit cd from Eden's Closet Treasures, I received the Cat one. I see others have had the same problem. Considering the hyped up cost... I call it misrepresentation of product. In other words stealing. I expect a full refund. Now when do I get paid for my time wasted on this nonsense?"
1,Looks nice....,"This mouse looks great sitting on my desk, broken. The mouse worked flawlessly for a few months, then I started to have problems with it. It would lose connectivity after a certain amount of time, and unfortunately it got shorter and shorter. Now the mouse is pretty much useless. I might have gotten a defective model, I am not sure, but I would not reccomend this mouse. I also have visited their website for software updates but after installing them, they did not help."
1,not recommended,"Sorry, but I can't recommend her books to any serious trader or student of trading; her books have been criticized for their cotton candy, hurah hurah motivational type writing which, frankly, is irritating after the 5th page, while at the same time, lacking any credible, scientific, and meaningful strategies for making money in the stock market. This one appears to be just a rehash of the earlier ones, written in a more 'textual' type format. If you want a decent introduction to trading, try Link's High Probability Trading or Markham's Swing Trading. For more critique of Turner, see my review on her Day Trading book. Good luck aspiring traders everywhere."
1,too many mistakes,"this kindle book has an extremely large number of words that are cut off, but always in the beginning of the word.Example: ""brigade"" is printed as ""ade"", ""children"" is printed as ""ren"". there are so many typos that it is very difficult to understand the meaning of many of the sentences.I would like my money refunded"
1,charge station,"This is a total rip off, do not buy this product. I bought one thinking it looked like a good deal and it never worked, the batteries never charged and the LED ligts never worked. Thinking it was just one bad item i returned it and exchanged it for another, and that one also did not work, don't waste your money or time on this thing, the offical x-box quick charger actually works."
1,"Lacks useful info, any info, about yoga and menopause",Disappointing. Just another yoga tape with the teacher uttering platitudes about menopause in two unrelated segments at the beginning and end of the tape. No info about the benefits of the poses vis-a-vis menopause. Ho-hum class.
1,Much Potential - - Very Disappointing,"Having not read any of Slaughter's series featuring Georgia coroner Dr. Sara Linton, I happily picked up the recently re-issued paperback copy of the debut novel BLINDSIGHTED. Linton's graphic and disturbing discovery of a young blind woman in a cafe ladies room got things off to a riveting start but went downhill after that with stereotypical involvements (her ex is on the police force)and oh-so-slow progression to a nothing to brag about ending. Unless it's a freebie, I doubt seriously I'll read further novels in this series."
1,Mistake to get this book,I bought this book and found atleast 12 problems wrong in the simple math problem... these were simple problems that if the editor would have looked through would have found. Some of the problems didn't even have the correct answer for a choice!!! Do not get this book!!!!
1,only adequate for $20.00,using this as a switch.trying to change the default IP address took a couple of attempts. it seemed to have problems saving it.the reset button is wonky.don't buy it.
1,good for big headphones not earbuds,"not the ones I thought they were. so I sent them back, they look like they could have got the job done but, they were for bigger headphones, not ear buds."
1,Have yet to finish it.,"After owning the book for three years, I've yet to finish it. In style it is archaic, the method being used to advance the plot being in disuse since quite some time and as a result it is a great deterrent to the modern reader."
1,Weak,"I bought this ladder at Home Depot for use around the house. I was very surprised how weak the ladder is...It says 300 pound rated but I did not feel safe putting my 185 pounds on the top step. It is cheaply made and weak. Wish I could give it a ""0"" rating. Is China the only place that makes a ladder today? Nothing in North America?I have given this ladder to daughter to hold a plant. It works good for that.But this one is only $11Metal Two-Tier Plant Stand"
1,What a joke...!,"If by this point you think this is a remarkable book, you either (a) are the woman who wrote it, or (b) you don't read very much. In this case it's probably both."
1,A waste of money,"If only -0 were an option, what a way to waste a Blockbuster gift card. If you want historical INACCURACY this is a movie for you and if you just want plain incompetent movie making, then you'll have the twice the fun.Farrell is too clean cut to be considered seriously at an outlaw and this movie won't help his career any. The only saving grace is Timothy Dalton and a cameo of Kathy Bates. Oh and I guess I didn't really have to pay for this stinker. Thank goodness."
1,Disappointed in product!,"Our first unit arrived and with in the first day of use was giving errors on known good wiring. We discovered two of the four nodes were the problem. We contacted the manufacturer and they wanted us to return to our place of purchase. Amazon was great about promptly returning. At the same time we ordered an identical one and when it arrived, we promptly tested with known good cables. Again, we found we had defective node end points. We called the manufacturer again and they never called us back as promised.In the end, we return the second unit to Amazon and are now looking for another make/model to purchase. If you purchase this, do so with caution testing all components immediately and for the next several days. :-("
1,Tester,"Sound is great, navigation easy, good quality voice recording.There are two major problems:1. The title and artist name of some songs is not copied to the player. They are simply ""lost"" for some songs, without any detectable reason.2. After copying, recording and deleting files in the player does not correctly release the memory space. The result is that you have less and less space for new songs and recordings. The only way I found to correct the problem is to format and reload the songs, but that re-creates the problem described in #1.I am not sure if a new firmware would resolve it. I opted to return the player."
1,Eddie Bauer Car Seat Base,This is an UNSAFE SYSTEM AND NEEDS TO BE RECALLED ASAP BEFORE A CHILD DIES!! Looked in my back seat and my 3 week old infant was tilted almost tipped over due to this base. Returned the entire system and got Graco Metro Lite and I am VERY pleased with it. I pray they recall this system before an innocent infant loses its life!!
1,Not Pleased:(,"Not a good camera. Terrible in low light. Terrible focusing in low light. Just, all in all, a bad camera. Invested so much time in the whole wireless feature, forgot to perfect the basic camera necessitities. Trust this review, have had several cameras and none have which have been near this frustrating to own. Looks are cool but thats where it stops!"
1,Disappointing.....,"Let me say first that DT is still the best band in the world!!Having said that, even great bands can put out bad CD's.....or maybe I should say bad idea for a CD. Past DT CD's mixed heavy, driving songs with songs that allowed you to breath. A DT CD was a journey, taking you through a mix of emotions.ToT is one emotion: angry. It sounds like they were going for the Lincoln Park, Godsmack thing; only with more musicianship!"
1,This product is garbage,"I bought this product to prevent oil spills. Conceptually it is sound. Practically, not so much. once it fills with oil, the oil leaks out of the smaller front lid sending oil on to the floor. No matter how you twist the smaller cap it will not make a seal. I am returning this product for a refund. Terrible. In addition, the larger top lid is no better. I bought this from a brick store and compared it to others of the same product, and they all have very poor quality (none of them made proper lid seals). Save yourself a headache and disappointment. Do not buy this product."
1,Poor accuracy out of the box,Looking for indicators that would work and tried this one. Innacurate out of the box. Save your money.Recommend the Taylor 806E4L Weekend Warrior Waterproof Digital Thermometer instead.
1,wrong product,the set i got was not haydn 55-69. it was however one of the later sets that i had planned to purchase later. but now i will have to purchase what i ordered again so that i can complete my set. my suggestion ; either hire someone that can read or LEARN how to read!
1,Not my cup of tea,"Being an American Idol fan, and with SOTR being one of my favorite songs of all time - I bought this CD from Walmart earlier today. I was greatly disappointed. My Destiny is just a weak song - no fault of Ms McPhee, but that song simply should not have made the cut to be recorded! As for SOTR, she made a commendable attempt, but still fell far short of other versions I've heard, particularly the original by Judy Garland. Am glad this is only a single and I didn't have to pay that much for it."
1,No support for full figured,"I ordered the size suggested, but I have to say, if you think you need the large, don't buy it unless you are very pert - it doesn't provide any support and you tend to fall out all over."
1,where did the plot go?,"I was a very big fan of Mrs. Hamilton's first Anita Blake books which contained detailed characters, a good plot, and quite a bit of humor. However these last few have basically turned everything around.With Anita's former best friend Ronnie as a complete b**** and Richard apparently going through some major issues the Anita Blake series has turned into something that reads like a low budget porn.I lost track of the number of scenes in this book althought I am fairly sure that made up a good half of it. Even Requiem went from being a somewhat interesting character to this junked up arduer sex fiend.The series has turned from a good supernatural detective series to cheap a harlequinn style with no plot and shallow characters."
1,caveat emptor,"You initially asked me to review my purchase of that Hoover cleaner I bought but now you say on this page I am to review only the Package of Bags! ... You of course realize you are making this ""easy"" review difficult....I wonder why. But YOU asked for this.Hold your breath. I give the cleaner a zero or at least aone-half rating on a 1 to 10 (ten being the highest). I have used the cleaner twice, to give it a fair chance.THE killer point about the cleaner is its so-called highly maneuverable hose....yeah.It is about as supple and lithe as a steel pipe and is an absolute drag on the device. It gives one a real workout.If only I had not bought it. Oh well, c'est la vie.I am going to buy an upright vacuum, not a Hoover and not from Amazon.Thanks a lot."
1,you get what you pay for,"i recieve this item broken, i order 2 one was in good condition, the oter came in pieces out of the box. it more trouble for me to return it so i kept it for parts"
1,LOL Humorous Adventures from Cyberspace by Victoria Ross,"I found this book very difficult and repetitive to read. I had to force myself to keep reading. The title was not at all applicable to the content of the book. I didn't laugh at all although I did shed some tears in the chapter ""Life Long Buddies"" The only other two stories that were worth reading were ""Growing Up In Sydney Australia, Or Have I?"" and ""The Wombat Learnings."""
1,una porqueria,"this cd is a waste, don't spend your money on it. You're better off buying another cd of Ricky Martin. He has nothing to do with this album."
1,painful to finish,This is the 2nd Heck book I read. The Connecticut Yankee in Criminal Court was decent around a 4 star. However this book dragged . The characters were bland and I found myself skimming just to find out the ending. I am going to hold off reading any more of his work.
1,Crap Map,I have to say this map is absolute rubbish and definitely not worth the money. It is very poor quality laminate and the map itself was damaged upon receipt; it was creased right through the centre of the map and beyond repair. Also the packaging was just awful. Very low grade and not what we have come to expect from Amazon generally.We sent this back straight away and would not recommend anyone to buy this
1,NOT ACCURATE!,Terrible- works only in the freezer. Bought 2 and can't use in the refrigerator at all. Waste of money!
1,Why is this our only choice for bread?,"Come on Amazon, give me a break. Powdered tofu? Get in some real food and I'll buy more from you. I went looking for table sugar. You've got 100 weird kinds of sugar (that you expect me to buy in bulk!) but NO just plain sugar. I'm not eatin' any more of this rice and tofu bread either.Sorry I just had to rant."
1,Brilliant and stunning!,I believe in the every growing rate of sophistication in our country and I'm sure with books like this we can take our government more seriously
1,Dave or unknown losers?,What was supposedly a Dave Chappelle dvd ends up being nothing to do with it and tells the story of the struggle of two up and coming comedians and their fight to fame. Would have been less misleading if Chappelle's name was not the title as he was only in it for two minutes. Disappointing
1,Contradicts our family values,"I would not suggest this book for a Christian family. The premise is commendable, but the content contradicts how we are trying to raise our daughter. For example, the book offers tips for a first kiss to girls as young as ten, and insinuates that such behavior is normal and acceptable. I have worked with children in this age group, and I know it is possible to balance hormonal changes and desires without experimenting with romantic or physical relationships prematurely. This may work for some families, but Christian parents should use a more biblically sound text, as well as scripture and common sense, to address these issues with their children."
1,don't buy this book,"There was absolutely nothing hear that gave strategies and/or secrets to Panzer General 3D Assault! The instruction manual that comes w/this game comes w/ a better strategy plan for the tutorial, than any of the strategies listed here. Most strategies are one to three paragraphs long!! Hardly any info. for you to use. Don't buy this book, if you really want it, email me, and I sell you my copy for a buck! Thats about how much its worth! If I could rate this book a minus 1, it still would be over-rated!"
1,Read the fine print - then walk away,"READ THE WARRANTEE at [...] - for obvious reasons, you won't find it in any of their advertising or hang tags. THE WARRANTEE IS VOID IF YOU COOK OVER HIGH HEAT. In black and white the warrantee states you can only use this pan over medium or low heat (they state high heat is unnecessary when cooking with diamonds . . .BS!). In other words, this pan cannot be used for braising, searing, or any other of a million things a fry pan is meant to do. After 6 months of normal household use on a standard gas range, the pan started sticking to the point that it was virtually impossible to fry an egg even with a generous coating of butter or oil. I took the pan back to the cooking store and they told me the pan had ""obviously"" been used over a high flame and wouldn't replace it under warrantee."
1,Read the dedication,"The best part of this book was the Dedication, ""Dedicated to all our readers who keep asking us, 'And then what happens?'"" Darksword was a great trilogy. There was no need to mess it up with this fourth book. This is why not to keep asking what happens next. The the plot did it's job in the trilogy; leave it alone and skip this follow-up book."
1,Not Purchasing,"I've read several reviews regarding the issue of ""Ultraviolet Digital Copy."" As it turns out, you need an application to play your digital copy (DC) called Flixter. The million dollar question that everyone is asking is if you're still able to play it on your iPod, other devices. The answer is no. To play your DC, you need to be online. What's the point? If I was on a plane, train etc with no internet access, how am I to enjoy a movie that I paid for? As the number of combo movie purchases are made, Flixter (DC) offers a nasty alternative and I hope Flixter dwindles."
1,This is a slap in the face for fans,"I cannot believe that the studio is really going to release only the theatrical release when a blu-ray edition finally shows up! I already had to wait an extra year for each of the extended editions, and now I am going to have to wait again to get LotR on Blu-ray?Note to the heartless beancounter who thought they could pull the theatrical release/extended edition stunt a second time: Just because no one is buying this release does not mean that no one will buy the extended editions, it just means that we know that you could fit it but you just wanted to try and milk us for more money. We aren't buying it!"
1,Weak has many errors,This book has many errors and the topics are not covered in a good way making it hard to follow.
1,Too Whimsical for Me,"I am taking on-line classes in Java. I thought this book would be a good way to get more detailed insight into the material covered in the class. However, the topics seem way too scattered and whimsical for my needs and liking. I really want to be able to look up a topic (such as loops) and get the information in one chapter. The index is minimal. The book may work if you use it as a tutorial and got through it starting in chapter 1."
1,allan Folsoms book exile,"It wasn't the book I ordered it is an uncut manuscript version of it.The sellers need to be more specific on what they have ,I just wanted the book it looks nothing like the picture and is very misleading.I'm not happy with this purchase and will probably not purchase again at amazon.If asked by any one i will let them know to be extremely careful as you don't always get, what you think you ordered.Extremely disatisfiedDebi McGee"
1,very flat,"I liked some of the debut Album.""I would do anything""&Why were my cuts,but this album doesn't have one stand-out cut to me. there Cover of Lionel Richie's 'stuck on you"" Sounds like bad Karoke night or something.they Might be Jacksons,but they don't show me any of Michael's or Jermaine's Impact or Influence on them that much.maybe next time."
1,My Pump also quit,"As I have read in many posts, my pump also won't pump. It fills up the small res on a daily basis so you have to empty every day and when it is full, usually about 3 am it makes a never ending beeping sound you can hear all over the house so If I forget to empty it before bed I will be emptying it at 3am like it or not. Also the humidity control gauge is nowhere near accurate. My own gauges tell me about 50% and it reads 90%. I don't like this unit at all."
1,"After two weeks, the massager stopped working","After two weeks, the massager stopped working. I even replaced the batteries but it would no longer turn on. I had to return the product for a refund.Also, the battery comparment easily falls out of its slot in the cushion whenever the cushion is moved and often sticks into your back.The memory foam flattens out and doesn't really offer the support I needed or expected, far less support than a normal pillow."
1,For 30 Bucks,"Uhhh People..... For 30 bucks or less you could just buy a case of beer (not twist off), drink it, then use the bottles to brew. Why would you want to pay for a plastic bottle when you could get glass for free with a case or even freer grab the empties at your buddies house."
1,Too long...too simple...what a waste of time!,"I've read several of Grisham's earlier novels, and I thought they were imaginative and easy to read. ""The Summons"" on the other hand, is about 100 pages too long i.e. very repetitive, lacks imagination, and the ending is almost predictable. One wonders whether the author just writes anything to get a book published and to make money for it. Evidently the editorial publishers don't care how poorly his books are written."
1,Cup/Chip Holders do not fit on Poker Side.,"There are two sides to this table: poker and blackjack. The cup/chip holders come on the blackjack side and you can just swap them for whichever game you want to play, BUT the holders DONT fit right on the Poker side! Some I was able to force in, and others are too big and stick out. The felt is nice, but the table looks like crap because it is defective and the holders dont fit. Not what I wanted to buy fella."
1,Worst cat toy ever.,This toy is a waste of money. It is just wire with cardboard attached. My cat would not even acknowledge it was there. This is not worth ordering.
1,The poorest service I have ever received,"The 2nd hand Green Zone BD I got had a broken case, email seller for replacement but seller was very slow in response, took more almost 2 weeks to get a replacement. Then after reviewing details of my purchase, I realized that it wasn't what I ordered - I ordered the 2 disc limited edition with digital copy, but received only the single disc version without digital copy. So I contact seller again, and he said mail it back for a refund .... so here I returned it again, only it is more then 2 weeks after he received my returned BD but I am still waiting for the refund. Will definitely not buy from this seller again, and not recommend other customer to purchase from this seller!"
1,Where is the music?,"It continues to amaze me how people can continue to be impressed with someone's ""technical"" performance on a CD despite the lack of musicality. Steve Gadd is a superb drummer, as evidenced on so many recordings. But this one is the worst I've heard, because the music is so lacking in depth. It is cliche at best. I agree with the other reviewer who also gave this a poorer rating. Just not poor enough, in my opinion."
1,Why split the season? It's Ludicrous!,"Are Paramount trying to kill Dynasty on dvd?Why are they doing this and why is HALF of Season 3 going to cost the same as the whole of Season 2?At this rate we'll be lucky to ever get the whole series on dvd!Please don't do this to us Paramount, have a rethink and get the full seasons on the market and they WILL sell! If you release a couple of seasons at the same time fans ARE going to buy!Whoever came up with this split season nonsense should be FIRED IMMEDIATELY."
1,Sound quality sucks,"It performs as advertised except for the sound quality. You would think, with today's technology, they could produce a better sounding machine."
1,grip mobile socket organizer,I had to send them back when removing a socket from the holder most of the holders broke off.To me it's a wast of money
1,Far from his best.,"Although this movie way enjoyed by many people, I cannot be one to share in that class. Jackie was made for action and will always be made for action. There acting was far from his best and the ""emotional"" scenes were more insulting to the audience then heartbreaking. If your a Jackie Chan fan, see it once. If not, don't look twice."
1,Depressing,"There was nothing uplifting about this story. It is such a long and sad book about a Chinese American woman who didn't seem to resolve childhood issues of sibling rivalry or incest. Granted, many of the characters are colorful and realistic. However, the writing at the end of the book leaves the reader just a bit confused. So, was it another suicide attempt or was she recalling her previous attempt"
1,Terrible monitor experience!,"I'm now on my third 930SB from mitsubishi . . .First died w/in 24 hrs of installation . . .NEC customer support was fine and sent me a brand newmonitor, but it was out of stock, so i waitedtwo weeks to receive it. Five days into the secondmonitor, faint white lines appeared vertically . . .I do graphics work and this was not helpful! Once again,they send me another monitor (only 3 days to get this one).I was just thinking the other 2 were flukes when thisone started showing similar white lines! AAAAAGH!what did i do to deserve this?! I'm sure tech support will beglad to send me another one, but I'm gonna try my hardest to get them to send me a different model! They'll probably tell me where to go!Oh well . . . thems the breaks!Maybe it's just bad luck, but i would stay FAR away from this monitor!"
1,fun music but cacophanous and lacking in cohesiveness,"Their newest CD does have the same fun and flair that marked their past albums, but this time the music is just inundated with too much muscial digressions from a clear and enduring melody. Some of the songs incorporated ska-like elements. The simpler tunes in Hot and Inevitable are much more enjoyable and not so harsh in integrating the all the instruments they use. And what a disappointment that Katherine Whalen's beautiful and unique ""Billy"" voice was only heard on a couple of songs, mostly the short ones! And Maxwell has to stop shouting (there's a song which poorly imitates the popular ""Hell""). All in all, quite different from the prior albums."
1,Never received the item.,I never received the item because of some fumbled shipping or processing on amazon's part. I refused the order and they refunded the money because it was a time sensitive order and it was useless at the point they could finally get it to me.
1,Violent,"We saw this movie in a theater. It was nearly impossible to follow the movie due to so many children crying and horrified parents standing and dragging their children out of the theater. This movie contains scenes with guns, shooting and killing, intense chase scenes, nasty soldiers and a seemingly dead horse that threw the 7 yr old next to us into hysterics. Spirit may look like a cute horsey movie for the little ones, but it is entirely innapropriate for the younger set. If you're old enough that the violence and guns don't bother you, you'll probably find the movie insipid anyways. I have no idea who the producers of Spirit thought would enjoy it... no one we know did."
1,Judi Dench,"I going to make it quick and succint... Why oh why are movies like this made??? such a waste of talent and money.... O.K. we get it Queen Victoria is broken hearted at the death of here husband.Then this noble man comes to her rescue to try to get her out of her gloom... Lord have mercy, bored is, well there just isn't a word in the english language to conveys how utterly stupid thischeaply made costume drama is. Don't waste your time... As Evelyn said on 2-1/2 men when Jake tried to explain Sponge Bob Square Pants... No. Life is just to short."
1,Don't buy it!!,"I have used Turbo Tax Deluxe for years. After unsuccessfully trying to use it this year, I will never buy it again. The updates aren't availabe for downloading, to print your forms, you have to download the fonts, to talk to customer service/technical help they put you on hold for over a hour and not helpful at all. Turbo Tax uses Outsourcing as everyone I did manage to talk to are in India. The whole program is useless. They have lost another customer."
1,Peeeeee-Uuuuuuuuuuu,"I have not used these BBQ gloves yet, so I can't speak about how functional they are...but goodness, they smell awful. They have a STRONG chemical smell, even after lathering them up with soap and washing them by hand a couple of times. I'm trying to air them out and am hoping the smell will dissipate. I plan on using them when I'm cooking whole chickens on my rotisserie."
1,Why do I need so much detail about networking?,"If you are looking to buy a book like this, I would suppose that you know a little about networking. This book spends far too much time teaching what you should already know about networking. There are other books and free how-to's that are specific to networking . I am still searching for a concise book that tells me exactly what I need to know about Samba, not an ""N+ training"" manual. I got so tired of trying to glean out the Samba information I quit reading and gave up. Why do so many Linux authors feel they have to tell the history of Linux again, and again, and again, and.......?"
1,Very Mac-centric,The book is very Mac-centric. While a few charts include windows key commands all screen shots are Mac screens and look VERY diferent from Finale98 for Windows. Only in guitar chord creation does this book venture past the online and in-the-box documentation of the program itself.
1,Dificult to mount and vibrate way too much,"I bought a pair of these... Dificult to mount, and too light weight to not vibrate wildly even with every boly fully torqued. Vibration at 55 MPH was so bad that the mirrors were useless. Fender mounts place the mirror too far away. I ended up buying door mount mirrors that are much better."
1,Could never get through the first several chapters,"I'm not a huge fan of historical non-fiction, but I thought I'd take a chance on this book as my ancestry includes some transported to Australia so I was especially interested. Despite multiple of my best efforts, I never could get more than about a quarter of the way through this book. It seemed very repetitive--there would be many, many anecdotes to try to prove each point with many of the points themselves being quite repetitive. From the parts I read, this book would have benefited by being cut down to about 1/5 its current size. Too bad it wasn't--it's a story I would love to know more about."
1,2 thumbs down!!!,The colors are great.. The stroller is light and I like how you can fold it up and has a strap. The carseat makes my baby sweat. It doesn't seem breathable. I'm in the market to purchasing another stroller. The stroller itself is hard to maneuver with one hand. I find myself picking it up everytime I want to turn.
1,WHAT? DIS SH*T IS WHACK!!!,"Pleez, this stuff is not good at all, drop the stupid crap, it all sux, dont waste ur time on stuff this awful. It so bad, i havent heard like ne of the songs playa>>"
1,New England Abolition Spin on the War Between the States,This DVD was a big disappointment. I thought that Smithsonian would provide an objective presentation of the entire era of the War Between the States. Not so. This product represents the radical Northern view as objective history. It is a propaganda piece!
1,(...),"What is this crap? punk? indie? They look like retarded morons who stayed on the 50's, i cant believe Roadrunner its producing music and DVDs from this $h|tty band. Dont even bother to buy this crap its worth zero not even a penny."
1,Nothing special about this,"Could have spent half the money that this item cost and bought it local. Nothing special of specific about this bottle, not really a gold specific tool. Shop elsewhere."
1,Do not waste your money or time,"I purchased this camcorder less than a year ago. I had to exchange it within 4 days of purchase becasue of the lense cover error, now 10 months later my second one is doing the same thing. JVC pretty much says it is a fluke thing, I guess not. Also AmericanTV where it was purchased is doing the oh well as well. I will never purchase another JVC product or shop american. I have lost alot of memories do to this very common proplem."
1,Politically Motivated Shennanigans!,"An inciteful not an insightful book. Fit for those that watch Fahrenheit 9-11. Devotes little time to fact, highly discredited and worth little less than the paper it was printed on. A great waste of money and useless diversion from the politics of the moment. Everything is fair in war and love , but in an attempt to present gibberish in the wool of intellectual analysis is not only disgraceful but once again re-emphasizes the politics of hate and destruction that have overtaken our nation, about a decade after the 1992 election was won and lost. God Bless George Kerry and no one else - that is the succint review."
1,The academic types love it.,"I guess it makes one feel intellectually in touch if he can praise this book. I guess I will never make it to that level, because I think this is one terrible book. I read approximately 100 pages on the traits of Fox Edwards, therefore, I was a little upset when I found out it was for no reason. I read with interest the last few pages where I found out that Wolfe's editor had to piece together several parts of this book, and then he had to write many pages in order to tie this mess together. All of this occured after Wolfe's death. I believe this is a collection of ramblings from Thomas Wolfe. I am sure that I can be attacked verbally for not understanding the meaning of this great work, but if it was truly a great work, I would not have missed its significance. Please, play with the kids, walk around the block, start drinking, but don't waste your time on this book."
1,Schwa was here,"Inconspicuous, camouflaged, hidden, unnoticed, many terms could be used to describe the ""Schwa."" However, none of these words are as accurately descriptive of the Schwa as ""functionally invisible."" Functionally invisible were the best words to use to describe someone as supernatural as the Schwa. Only 1 out of 5 people can see the young man by the name of Calvin Schwa. Even blind girls can notice him, but average people don't even know he's there. In the book ""The Schwa Was Here by Neal Schust'rman"" Anthony(Antsy) Bonano, describes his view of the Schwa. Being one of the people who can se the Schwa, Antsy is curious to know the Schwa's deep secret about his long gone mother. Once Antsy hears the story, the Schwa, and him set out to search for her on an adventure of a lifetime."
1,Not safe!!!,"When you remove the kettle from the base you need not to forget to switch it off (while other kettles which we had before had an automatic switch off option). in case you forget to do this and you put the empty kettle back, the base heats the empty kettle!! It happened with me, so that the empty kettle worked the whole night. It raised my last electricity bill! It fails to shut off quite frequently!!! It is really dangerous. I do not recommend this kettle at all!"
1,Horrible and Boring,"This movie should be 10min long because that's how long it takes to tell the story. Husband goes to space, alien takes over his body, alien gets wife pregnant, woman fights alien husband. The end. I can't tell you how many boring and pointless scenes there are in this movie that have nothing to do with story or character development. After the woman finds out she's pregnant she goes to talk with other pregnant women who are talking about getting their feet rubbed. Charlize Theron is horrible in this movie. She has no personality and doesn't show any acting ability until the last 5min of the film. She walks around completely bored throughout the entire movie. You learn that her character ""sees dead people"" which has nothing to do with the story. Johnny Depp is a great actor but he really has nothing to work with in this movie. It's just horrible. I can't believe I watched the whole thing."
1,ONe for the Money,I didn't like this audio book at all. The verbage is imature and the plot is simplistic. THe worst part of this audio book is the narrator with the New Jersey accent. Maybe teenage girls might like this story line but this 40 plus woman found it idiotic. I have 2 more books in this series to listen to. I wish I had not bought all three.
1,Dictionary least of all possible evils,"While there are no ""great"" Uzbek-English dictionaries currently available in the West, Waterson's is the most useful among a group of poor dictionaries. For the individual who is trying to read Uzbek texts without knowing Russian, Waterson leaves you frustrated. Also, dialectical differences are ignored within the entries. In short, until something better comes along, Waterson is the least of all possible evils."
1,"Useful for Basic Information, but not Current with Fees","I bought this book to obtain more information than what is generally available on the Internet. Though It covered all the basic information, the author has not bothered to keep it current. e.g. The current cost of an Naturalization is $225.00 + $25.00 for finger printing not $95.00 as stated in the form printed in the book. Which means that the forms printed in the book are out of date. Also information given about finger printing process is totally wrong.Overall I was very dissappointed with this book. Author has the potential to come up with a revised edition that not only carries current information but also has a section for all the fees and finger printing process."
1,Skip it-better books out there,"I was very disappointed in this book. I bought 3 books when I was diagnosed with Gestational Diabetes & this one cost the most & it was the least helpful. I didn't like the questions & answer format of this book. I wanted facts & advice, not corny questions & answers. Alot of fluff. I recomend Managing your Gestational Diabetes by Lois Jovanovic-Peterson MD instead."
1,Depends on what you want...not what I want,"I don't actually have one but have seen other's. It is not for me, and whether it's good for you depends on what you want. I am a very basic user. I have the Ipod classic 60 and that is enough for me. I don't have anything but music and I have about 1200 songs on it and still have plenty of room. It works great and hardly every freezes. The wheel works great. And it has playlists, something the Touch doesn't have. I love setting up playlists and changing them. I would really miss it. So before you get the touch I pod, you really need to consider your needs and wants. I absolutely love my ipod classic and can't imagine trading it in for the latest technology just because it's there."
1,Buchanan is intellectually bankrupt,"Isolationism is an intellectually bankrupt basis for building a foreign policy. Not only is it foolish, it is impossible in the context of our global economy. His views on WWII are laughable. Anyone who votes for Buchanan is voting for stagnation and bigotry."
1,Short lifespan,"Like other reviewers, I experienced a short lifespan on this product. It lasted a little over six months, then failed while I was at work, letting the temperature drop dangerously low."
1,Disappointing,"I read this book because I have read everything else written about Pern (and several other series for that matter) and loved most of them. Unfortunately, I felt that this book introduced too many sub-plots that were not completed and reused too many from previous novels (I am tired of reading about the gang of misfits causing trouble). Mid-way through the book, I felt that was oblidged to finished, but not really all that interested. Sorry, Anne."
1,Not very Secure,"Three of the locks seem to work ok. One of the locks could be pulled open with little force and was useless. Probably ok for transport via airlines, not not a real security deterant."
1,Hurtful with lack of hope for a spouse suffering celibacy,"I,m sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but this book was very hurtful to me in the darkest days of my marriage. The chapter on sex says in effect, the abused spouse needs to taking a ""healing vacation"" from sex, it then goes on to tell the non-abused spouse: you'll learn to live without, apparently forever. There was no assurance it would ever get better. Fortunately my marriage did get better, but this book didn't. The authors mean well and have much good to offer, but if you've been a married monk for 12 months, you don't want to hear it."
1,It's missing the big hits!,"I was mislead by my evil friend Brian. He told me that this album had all their biggest hits on it, which is far from true. I was looking for the album with ""All the Small Things"" and ""What's My Age Again?"", but I can't find them anywhere. I know that those are done by Sum 41, cuz my friend Bill told me so. If you can help me out with this, email me here: bobstone1357@yahoo.com"
1,Lasted 5 mins,My bull dog happily chewed this toy for 5 mins till I had to take it away from him for his safety. :(
1,EXCELLENT MUSIC!!!!,I like very much this record. Maestro Mauriat's recordings are superb. I would like to reccommend this album is magnificent!!!
1,"Poor design, not freestanding","I got this bike stand as a gift for Christmas. I assembled it and the stand just falls forward. I thought maybe it was too light, so I placed one bike on the stand, and it made it worse. It is a poor design. It is very top heavy, so it just falls forward immediately after I assembled it. It is definitely not free standing. I wanted to place the stand up against some cabinets, so I was not about to drill a hole into the cabinet to hold the stand. The product description says that wall mounting is optional, but that is not true. I would say that wall mounting is REQUIRED. I returned this item to Amazon and will lose out on a Christmas gift. It's better than keeping an item that would be totally useless in my garage, unless I wanted to use it to hang coats (still would need to mount it to the wall though). I do not recommend this bike stand."
1,Boring and Unrealistic,"Although I'm not a fan of Tom Cruise, I received the DVD as a gift. I watched the movie with an open mind and was very disappointed. I suppose, rent if you are a fan of Tom Cruise, but otherwise stay away."
1,"It's Ok, but it doesn't take great pictures","I've had this camera for 6 months now. I like the waterproof aspect since I can take it boating or to the beach and not have to worry. My first battery failed within a week of getting the camera and it was a hassle getting a replacement battery from the company.But, I think it just doesn't take very good pictures. At least 25% of the pictures I took on vacation this summer turned out blurry or out of focus, no matter what setting I put it on. It's also very slow to capture the picture, so I frequently miss shots. Finally, the flash doesn't reach very far, so anything I try to take in dim light doesn't come out very well.I had the Pentax 43WR for a few years and loved it, so when it was time to upgrade, this seemed like the ideal camera to purchase. I'll be getting a new camera soon, which is a shame since I've had this one such a short time, but I just don't think it's a very good camera."
1,Are you the lowest common denominator? Then this book is for you!,"I'm a fan of trashy pulp literature. I'm a fan of great books too, but trashy pulp literature certainly has it's place on my bookshelves. The Da Vinci Code however doesn't deserve the paper it was written on. Dan Brown writes like he's writing for children."
1,I Hear These Songs On The Radio Everyday,These songs are played on the radio everyday. You're better off recording these songs on a blank cassette tape. Anybody who buys NOW 22 knows full well that after a while that it's going to end up in a $1.99 bin at the used CD store. It's just one of *those* CDs.
1,BUYER BEWARE OF ANTONLINE,"Do not buy your camera carrying case through ANTonline if you want to be able to sleep at night. ANTonline has NO reputable customer service whatsoever! No telephone number, only an e-mail where they respond with platitudes that ""they will open an investigation."" Meanwhile, I still have not received my purchase and have not been refunded. They are more concerned with policing and smearing their customers in the review section, than they are with actually responding to REAL complaints. Think twice!!!"
1,Thelma & Louise,"A young and a middle-aged bimbo,Had lives that were drifting in limbo,They caused a big ruckus,And blew up a truckus,And left behind Darryl and Jimbo."
1,"Wrong Item Delivered, Poor Condition, No Response from Seller","I ordered Season 5, however Season 4 was delivered. It was in poor condition. I contacted the seller via email to exchange it, but have heard nothing in 3 weeks. I have been a satisfied customer with this seller in the past, but not anymore."
1,"Rating for item, not movie.",Digital Copy is not HD. Blu-Ray movies should come with HD digital copies and DVD should come with SD copies. This isn't rocket science folks.
1,"Hi 5 ""WOW"" cd",Bought this for my grandson because he loves HI 5. But it was the Australian version. He didn't recognize the singers and the songs sounded different. What a disappointment!!
1,Did not like,First of all I did not like the fact that before you saw the concert you saw alot of foreign junk--this dvd was made in the USA-------------why all the foreign junk----I am very proud to be an American and when I saw that junk it was an immediate turn off-------out comes the dvd and was sent back to the owner who gladly refunded me.
1,Answer me this,"If Limbaugh is so smart (and so popular), why is the first of only two books he's written in the last decade already out of print and only available in tapes-for-the-illiterate form?"
1,Harley-Davidson: The Spirit of America,"I was not impressed by this video. There was some good pictures but overall I feel the film does not live up to its advertisement. I have been a H-D owner,rider,enthusiast for over 10 years and ridden many scenic routes and been to several rallies which were far, far superior to anything on this film. Again, Film does not live up to its description!"
1,not worth a qaurter,enter the dragonfly sucks. theres so many glitches the load times are awful. the graphics are an embarrasement. and the characters have no personality except duh duh hi spyro. stupid lipsynching there not even moving there lipsb or making eye contact with spyro. theres only i boss. i was so upset i took this game on a trip to the trash not worth a qaurter.
1,Nice Except For Dreaded Chuck Wobble,"This drill has many nice features and is well-constructed for the price except for one caveat - chuck wobble. The wobbling chuck makes it nearly impossible to drill a hole true to size.I returned the first one ordered and while the second wobbles less, it nevertheless still wobbles. I may return this one, but I am wary of just getting another with the same problem or perhaps worse."
1,Sucks,"While the writing is fine, 500 pages of an 800+ page book spent on 'this love is wrong' while people are starving to death and a war is going on is an idiot book. Save yourself real grief and skip this stupid book."
1,Cracks and discolorations,The product looks fine overall but came with some discolorations throughout as well as a cracked front door and a back panel that wouldn't fit during assembly. I'm trying to work with Amazon in order to replace the damaged pieces but it's not ready to display the way it is now.
1,Is it really an approved study guide?,"Waste my money, waste my time. I buy it because it is the onlyone approved study guide and there is no book review at that time. Itis really horrible. How a 300 more pages training guide can make you pass Site Server exam? It is impossible. Even, it spends many pages talking about materials not Site Server related. How this book can be approved? Don't buy it anyway... END"
1,IT WILL NEVER WORK,"This type of training makes me want to puke. ""Positive Reinforcement"" training will NEVER work in the real world. The real world is full of automobiles, strangers, and other dogs. If you train your dog with treats and kisses, you are training your dog in the most INHUMANE way. Anybody with half a brain realizes that geniune affection and strict discipline is the ONLY HUMANE way to train a dog in the REAL WORLD. Products like this and the millions like it are a complete waste of time and money. I've trained dogs for quite sometime now and most of the people that come to me for REAL training have already wasted time and money on CRAP like this. Don't say I didn't warn you!"
1,Not worked!!!,"Yes, It is a nice price and we tough that it will be good, but it's cheap and regret it having it, after 7 month or little more this whole set star been very uncomfortable to have breakfast or dinner, it move like it was going to break and make me feel very bad, i do have a teen 13 year old boy and 5 year old girl nd trust me they did not make it like that.so it is a pice of a ""COLLECTION"" you buy it don't use it if you want to have a nice pice. of....... i contact seller they dint want to do nothing for 30 days guarantee.so now i do have to buy another one for double or triple of that money.... make number and i am screw...."
1,I hate this toy. Don't buy it.,This toy is constantly falling apart. You cannot move it and general play knocks it apart. It was not easy to assemble and worse to re-assemble. Don't buy it. the concept it good but the execution is poor. I was really disappointed.
1,Anticlimatic,"I enjoyed Bangkok 8, so I decided this book would be worth a read. The first half was very well done, albeit with a few annoyances (overruse of Farang, weak narrator voice, idiotic CIA characters), but it really deterioated once the tattoo artist came into the story. The intriguing plot between Zinna and Vikorn was completely dropped. And the last 50 pages were so ridiculous and uninteresting that it was only with great force did I finish the book. Not reccommended."
1,vividly forgettable,"I have no business writing this review, for I read Moaveni's ""Lipstick Jihad"" over eight months ago, and can recall little about it.Then why, you may ask, are you writing a review? If you can remember nothing about the characters sketched, the episodes related, the lessons learned, the style employed, etc. -- if none of these things has stuck in your mind, what could you possibly have to say about the book?My point exactly."
1,Be Careful!!!,I had this dryer for about 8 months when I used it one day it just broke from inside it was scary if I were you I wouldn't use this get a new dryer before it happens.
1,Multiple problems - maybe me or maybe product,"I have had the following problems with the Rangebooster. I would rate myself at a 7 out of 10 for installation and technical proficiency with Windows. First, the Rangebooster is not consistent in maintaining a connection; second, the Connection manager/wizard will not open; third, the D-Link webpage has upgraded software, and the software's executable file will not install when unzipped and selected; finally, inconsistent access to network - problems acquiring network address."
1,childish and sophomoric,Bill Maher is washed up and boring...he attacks the easy to attack and doesn't actually debate anyone worthwhile....rubbish
1,Incredible Hulk meets The Mighty Thor,"David Banner is back trying to ""control the beast that lies within him"". As usual Mr. Mcghee is still trying to find him. Everyone is older and it shows. The problem with this one is that the focus shifts too much towards Thor. A better story would have been better. Plus technology looked better 10 years earlier, you would think that the metamorphisis would look better, but it looks worse. However, if you are a die hard Hulk fan you will want to own this, but you will feel cheated. END"
1,neither a good documentary nor a proper concert,"This DVD purports to contain both a documtary of sorts along with a concert performance of Pavarotti, however fails to deliver on either. The first 15 tracks contain quasi-interviews of Mr. Pavarotti, at various locales, however are hampered by being dubbed into English over Pavarotti's comments in Italian.Worse, both the documentary and concert sections of this DVD are horribly edited. This is particularly annoying in the concert selections, as the film jumps, in the middle of arias, from Pavarotti singing in concert to the sappiest panoramas of beach scenes and the like. One might as well just listen to a concert CD and avoid being distracted by the kitchy attempts at artistic editing."
1,Salman's word salad,This book makes absolutely no sense at all. Mostly rambling diatribe to fill pages and call it a novel. A waste of money.
1,*Yawn*,"I have been reading these books from the very first when I picked up ""Hotel Translvania"" off the shelf in first edition. So believe me when I say:In this book nothing happens. Well, there are two love scenes at either end and a bit of excitement at the very end of the last chapter... but otherwise, he travels and worries about money, so nothing new.Big yawn.Come on, Chelsea, do something new. Bring the count into the 21st century so we can see how he copes with cameras and cell phones everywhere."
1,G A R B A G E,I cannot figure out why this trash was written....I see no redeeming social value other than to make a quick buck....i do not need to spend (...)and read 300 pages to see that theUN is run like a fraternity house....perhaps the authors should re-name their book Monty Python's Flying Circus on the East RiverIt reminds me of the fairy tales I see James Bone writing about in the London Times
1,"Yuck, yuck, yuck","...This book doesn't have any humor, that's for sure. It is as dry as a drought. (That means really dry, .... It's plot is also pretty much as exciting as a five hour lecture on how much TV children should be able to watch. (That means it's duller than dull...The plot is corny, dumb, and childish. I really couldn't like this book less if I tried.You would think this book is too bad to get published. Turns out it's not."
1,I Cannot Recommend,This is perhaps theaterical ballet class. The teacher (V Kabaniaev?) shows barre in costume pajamas and from behind so one cannot see foot. I declined to watch further. Of course I cannot recommend in any way.
1,I couldn't open the link,It took more than 2 hours and couldn't open the link. I had to watch the episode for my class so I wasted my money and time.
1,Totally Struggling,This was a very poor attempt at a remake. I think they thought that special effects would be so much better than actually having a story line. It was flat with no real story which just made it boring to watch. Definitely not one of my favorites this month. Don't waste your money is my recommendation.
1,"Stale, and not worth it.","I really tried to like these, but the were so hard and stale, I couldn't recommend these to anyone. My gums are sore from trying to massage this candy into a chewable state. I've been a fan of flavored tootsie rolls forever, but I'll just stick to the factory sealed assorted bags from now on."
1,Programming and Problem Solving with Java,"I purchased this book to use as a text for a beginning programming class and found the programming logic to be adequate, but overall I am not impressed with the way the author tries to teach Java in the text. I found his outline to learn and his methods of teaching the basics very poorly laid out. I feel it did not teach the basics of learning programming in any language, much less Java. What it did address, I don't feel it was presented in the proper order...he tried to teach you how to run before you even knew that you had feet. I would not recommend using this book to learn Java. This book was my initial exposure to programming and the only thing I learned for sure is that there has to be a better way to learn Java, or any other programming language, than the author presents in this book."
1,The cutting surface is terrible!,"Using this board is like trying to cut food on top of something that has been oiled. It even feels like it leaves oil on your fingers when you touch it. A good cutting board will be slightly dulled and will somewhat grip food so that it doesn't slide while cutting. The food slides all over this board. It's almost like cutting on glass but not quite as hard. And I hope that EVERYONE knows not to cut on glass!My daughter who is a professional chef can't stand to cut on this board. This board is a hard slippery piece of plastic, and I wonder if it doesn't dull the knives as well. I bought this for my Mother who needed a cutting board, (not for myself) and my daughter and I are both forced to use it when we visit my Mom. It really takes the fun out of chopping and I think it was a total waste of money. As far as keeping any chopping board from slipping, simply put a damp kitchen towel between the counter and the board, and it will go no where."
1,Rats in the Kitchen?,"I love Pixar movies, but this one actually made me sick thinking about rats cooking. I was hoping I could get past it, but couldn't. The talent of the Pixar group is incredible, they just needed a better script with different critters than the rats!"
1,Mine doesn't spray either!,"Just received my SpotBot and, as with a number of other users who reviewed the machine here, mine won't spray. The lights light up, the brushes turn, but the cleaning solution will not dispense. I took it into my local Bissell warranty service station and they had two other SpotBots in for repair with exactly the same problem. The tech said that he'll have to order parts for the repair...bummer when you can't use a product which you just purchased. Obviously Bissell has a major quality control/design problem with this machine."
1,caution: rock,for anyone in love with the commodore rock ep by ladytron be advised that this disc is not by the same band. this is some indie rock stuff that will go over very well with people who like sebadoh and the like.
1,The seam that connects top part to the bottom part digs into your lower ab - bad design.,I think this shape wear has a bad design - the seam between the top and bottom part digs into your lower ab and makes it very uncomfortable. They should make the whole thing seamless. I have a Lipo in a Box capri and I love it - it's seamless. I shouldn't have bothered with Flexees but I wanted to try because they had xs size. Lipo in a Box only has s.
1,This is an objective review of the content,"I've read all three of Carlin's books, and this is by far the worst. It really feels like Carlin was scraping the bottom of the barrel for material. It's very observational, but not very funny. Most of the book (I stopped at about page 95) is his word-play, which can be clever at times when it's interspersed with other funny material. But page after page of word-play and rants about euphimisms gets old. If you want funny Carlin material, read Brain Droppings, which had me laughing so hard I cried several times. Sorry, George, but this book is not funny."
1,Meh,Was pretty boring actually but that may be because I'd already read about the benefits of noni juice & not the book's fault.
1,The sky club,As a Scot I get really pissed off when authors (who are supposed to do research and know about the locations they write about) CONTINUALLY refer to the U K as England. After reading only a few pages of The Sky Club I find that Winston Churchill was the P M of England during WW2. Insulting to ALL the Scottish Regiments who fought in that's war or what? Make up your own mind!!!
1,I Haven't Seen It...,"...but if it's as rambling and semi-literate as the the e-mails that I get weekly from ""Pearl"" shilling for this thing then it's not worth the time or money."
1,WARNING-Greenies almost killed my dog too !!,"My dog loved her greenies too. She is not a ""gulper"". However, she developed a bowel obstruction after eating one and had to have emergency surgery-she almost didn't make it. The warning label on the package is in very MINUTE print-(not noticeable) DO NOT FEED YOUR DOG GREENIES !!"
1,Isn't worth the time,"Yeah, the Guinevere point of view was different, but I passed throught this book idly, it kept dragging on and on; surprised I didn't doze off in the middle.I like these feminism books, where the females point of view is taken instead of the usual male ( Try THE FORESTWIFE by THERESA TOMLINSON, taken from Maid Marian's point of view instead of Robin Hoods. I found The Forestwife much more enjoyable. the foreign words and old English dialect, it felt like I was in their age and time, unlike this book)."
1,Silly Ambience,This is a waste of your time. There's not much musical content here. Listen to Jon Hassell instead if you want a transcendental experience that relates to modern tribal cultures.
1,Grisham Falls Flat on His Face,"I am a big Grisham fan and have read all of his books except the 2 that he wrote recently which were not lawyer based. After his first 4 books Grisham was by far my favorite author but he seems to be no longer giving a good effort.King of Torts starts out OK with some promise but the last two thirds of the book is very mediocre, predictable and did not seem to have much real thought put into it.Grisham seems to be writing just to make money and has lost his ingenious imagination. He still is a very good writer but it seems like he is going through the motions.Let's hope he rolls up his sleeves and uses his excellent mind to create some more great books in the future but King of Torts is not one of them. For me it is very mediocre to poor."
1,Too Much Missing,This soundtrack released does not do the soundtrack of the movie justice. There are too many terrific songs missing. Who needs the instrumental stuff. We want the real songs with vocal artists. If a sample is good enough for you then this will do. It is not for me.
1,Farr fails as historian and excells as a painter with broad,"brush strokes. Never before have I read such conjecture...truly, I am appalled by the liberties Farr takes in construing the facts to suit her case. Indeed, I too am of the opinion that Marie Antoinette and Fersen were lovers; however nothing concrete has ever surfaced in any correspondence before and after the Queen's death to concusively determine the exact nature of the relationship. According to the publisher, Farr makes use of previously unpublished documents...really? Which ones? Did I miss something? This message is less a review to benefit other readers than a severe admonition to Farr: you have given the public nothing with this tissue of loosely woven fantasy...seemingly your fantasy. Stanley Loomis wrote the definitive book on this subject with The Fatal Friendship. Don't flatter yourself, Farr, the ""story"" has been told often enough (and more accurately) before you."
1,item never shipped,Product was to be del. by the 17th and still has not been shipped. They took my money and I have no product. Big Mistake! Gave one star bcuz that's the least I can rate.
1,This is not where I want to be...,"First off i will say that this album is not very great, as a matter of fact its not even worthy of maybe a....spot on MTV. Listen I dont hate MTV I just want it out of existance as soon as possible, and if you love Good Charolette and New Found Glory, then you'll LOVE this album. For MTV has pushed this album(which is horrid by the way)so much that i want to maybe...burn it. Yes, i want to burn this monstrosity, i am gonna be straight forward...anyone who buys this, isnt that smart..."
1,More of name dropping than Biography,I was very disappointed in this book. The author seemed more interested in writing about who he knew than about the rising star.
1,Rip off,"My wife gave me this as a gift. She meant well, so I appreciate it.But this DVD is worthless. Waste of money. Con job. I like Kreg tools, but they need to get out of the DVD business. I don't see why they want to screw over their customers like this. I feel like my wife just paid $10 for me to see some low budget infomerical. Wait a minute, the infomerical would actually have more information.Even a total newbie would be better off getting his information elsewhere.I agree with the other reviewer: SHAME ON YOU KREG. SHAME, SHAME, SHAME. You saw the chance to make a quick buck and didn't care if you screwed us over. If I ever meet the CEO of Kreg, this DVD is going to be shoved up a very dark place on his person."
1,Boing Boing on a DRM machine?,"Considering Cory Doctorow's outspoken stance on DRM, I am surprised to see Boing Boing's participation in this whole Kindle business."
1,Not much better than a toy guitar you'd buy at Walmart,"This thing is a piece of junk. I know the price is right, and if you're buying it to shut your kid up for a few minutes I'm sure it'll do the trick. But if you expect anything remotely resembling decent sound to come from it, think again. The tuners are crap, the intonation is horrible.Mine arrived with a sharp dent in the back of the neck and several scuffs on the neck and body. On top of that, the frets were freaking rusted! I don't mean a spot of tarnish here and there, literally 50% of what was supposed to be silver was rust.I don't know what damp shed this thing came from, but judging by the rusted frets I'm guessing this thing would have warped after a few months in my dry house. I didn't give it the chance and immediately returned it. The only reason it got two stars is because I didn't expect it to be perfect for the price. But this was unacceptable."
1,"OK, it [was terrible]...","I absolutely hated this story. All the characters did was moan about their lives and do stupid things. Daisy was a complete waste of oxygen and the rest of the characters just cried. There was no action, no suspense, and no real plot. The story didn't pick up until the end which is, let me remind you, the end. This book should never have written!..."
1,Terrible egg poacher,"Do not buy this egg poacher. The nonstick cups actually act as insulators, so it takes nearly 10 minutes to poach eggs to the proper doneness. In addition, the lid does not have any holes to allow moisture to escape, so the cups fill with water as the eggs are poaching. I gave away a 25-year-old aluminum, really cheap, egg poacher and replaced it with this one. Big mistake. The old one worked far better than this one."
1,What did I read?,"I did not understand why I was reading this book when I was reading it. And after finishing it I do not know if I learned anything from this book. Some small business owners may see themselves in this book, but that is it. This book just confirms the fact that ""one size does not fit all"". Success is so subjective. Different subjects have taken different approach and no reason was given as to why that was the best approach. Approach was solely the pick of the business owner.This book is a waste of time. I read it just because it came free from Zecco. The book has no flow or continuity. It looks like author is just trying to merge different stories into a book format. It would have been better if this book was in a case study format."
1,Junk,"This is a low grade, made in China, sheet metal, flimsy piece of junk. If you want a one-use and throw it away grill for the beach or lake, this might be it. Otherwise, get the cast iron Hibachi."
1,...,"I bought this book on a whim in at a Palm Springs bookstore. I want my money back. It is padded with stock pictures, stories based on rumor that end abruptly, and just about every person mentioned in the book is either gay or suspected of being gay, according to the author. What makes that part laughable is the author apparently is gay as well, bragging about his own week of debauchery at a P.S. resort. If the people in the book were alive they would have a great class action suit against Mungo. If Mungo had any balls he'd take on people that could actually fight back. One of the worst pieces of self serving trash ever published. This book deserves a no star rating, but [Amazon.com] doesn't provide for one."
1,Yes!,"This is a good chess set for the price. The only thing messed up is the codeing is on the wrong line. When you set up a chess board the white square is on the right. If you ues the codes, KN1 to KB3, they are maked incorrectly on the board."
1,Bones,Gruesome and grizzly. I threw it in the trash where it belongs after 100 pages. I didn't want to share it with anyone.
1,Don't waste your time on this turd!!!,"This movie was god awful from start to finish. Don't get me wrong, I'm a big fan of Thornton's other movies, especially ""Bad Santa."" But this flick is a piece of crap. I don't even think there was a script. They just said what came to mind. The only 2 things worth watching are Andy Griffith's un-Andy Griffith like portrayal of a man worried about his brother(Jim Varney) getting ""cornholed"" in jail and the first theatrical appearance of phone prankster Roy D. Mercer. Otherwise, the movie just plain sucks."
1,Mormon's Should Jihad,Hollywood has once again shown how much it dislikes organized religon.This movie is an anti Mormon movie. It depicts a time in history when something bad occurred and some Mormons in Utah during the 1850's made a horrible decision. But this movies purpose is not to tell that story it is to make the LDS church look bad to people that don't know much about it. If the LDS were Muslims they would declare a Fatwa against the producers. If they were Jews this movie could not have been shown the anti defamation league would have been all over it. Catholics and Mormons are always fair game by Hollywood because they don't fight back.
1,Starts off great...,"I wanted to get this CD after I first heard Lasgo's song ""Blue"" on the radio. It took me a long time until I actually got it, but when I did I listened to it nonstop. The songs are all moving, there are great beats, and the vocals are beautiful.But then a few weeks passed, and I could no longer help but notice how every song on this CD has the same one or two sounds in them, and after I realized this it became a lot harder to enjoy listening to it.It's been a while since I put this CD away, and I recently picked it back up and now I listen to it every now and then. But every day? I get bored after only an hour."
1,If you liked the book...DON'T SEE THIS,"What an unmitigated piece of garbage. Richard Harris is always wonderful but he's the only redeeming feature of this perverse twisting of Dumas' classic. See the Gérard Depardieu mini-series instead. (If you can ignore the fact that he doesn't look starved in the Chateau d'If, it's wonderful.) Except for Harris the acting is poor. The people are unrealistic and are, at best, caricatures of Dumas' creations. The writer has committed a crime."
1,Extremely Unreliable until it Died,"This started out being a great, inexpensive dvd recorder that worked well...at first. It would freeze up a lot requiring me to unplug it often. After a couple of months I was unplugging it several times an hour. It can't even perform the basics right anymore and won't read/play the very dvd's I recorded on it. And there is no company support!"
1,A terrible musical!,"I went to see this with my parents at the advanced screening in San Antonio. This is a really dumb musical- or half-musical. Cuba Gooding Jr.'s career is sinking fast. From A Murder of Crows, to Snow Dogs, to Boat Trip, he is becoming one of Hollywood's most despised actors. Go see Sister Act or Mr. Hollund's Opus before this trashy, mere psycho posturing excuse to make gags out of religious worship. I mean- Mike Epps is in it!"
1,LOOKS GOOD BUT NOT DURABLE,"This lasted about three years of only summer use. The motor burned out. This fan does look nice. It is hefty, but is not exactly a well made quality product. I had problems with the fan blade-it kept falling off. The blade is secured to the motor rod by small screw. Once or twice a season the blade would fall off. I had to remove the grill to reattach. Nothing too major, but I'd always wonder why this problem wasn't engineered out. I also believe this problem caused the motor to burn out. I think the blade fell off and lodged against the grill and stopped the motor rod from spinning.That being said, the fan looks good. I took the motor out and plan to replace the motor if i can find one that fits."
1,Expected More - Disappointing,"I am a semi-pro photographer and was looking to expand my photography. Food photography from what I've heard is an advanced art. But this book covers too much basic photography and not enough on how to shoot food.The chapters on food and prop styling where good. The chapter on composition was also good with lots of examples from the bad shots to the keepers. The lighting chapter was a joke with no real advice on how to best light food. His description of lighting ratios was less than half a page and didn't explain how to setup the lights to achieve the ratios.His Photoshop retouching examples are very-very basic. The last chapter on ""Getting into the Business"" has very general and basic business advice.If you are new to photography and looking for your first photo book, this book could be helpful. Amateur and advanced enthusiast photographers should look elsewhere."
1,not what i had hoped,"i was thinking that this was a cd where the music was taken from the movie, not all resung by elton john. the songs lost the flavor i was looking for. if you're an elton john fan you probably would like it"
1,Huh?,"""Due to our licensing agreements this video is currently not available for purchase or rental.""WTF is up with that?"
1,I forgot how bad this guy was,"When I came across this writer in a recommendation for books set in Florida, I remembered that I used to read his stuff, but couldn't remember why I quit. It has been at least ten years since I tortured myself by actually finishing one of his books. I don't know where to start except to say I'm not a huge fan of old guys who think they are super heroes. Maybe other old guys with no life find this b.s. to be entertaining, but I have better things to do than waste any more of my life or money on Randy Wayne White."
1,Junk,"Get a Malco 2 in 1 riveter, you won't regret spending the money. This is the worst riveter of the dozens I've used. I can't believe something like this even got out the door of quality control. Were they trying to build a tree ornament? Because it sure doesn't hold up to any riveting."
1,Charging only (will not sync),"Be forewarned, this cable will NOT sync your iPhone/iPod as described. It will charge, but that's it. I wish I had read the reviews more carefully b/c I really didn't need a charge-only cable. UGH"
1,terrible,I kept waiting for this movie to get better but it never did. It has to be the most boring movie ive seen. Don't. Waste your time
1,Regret this purchase,"I consider this phone almost useless due to the unacceptable amount of dropped calls I now deal with. I blame the phone because when I'm standing next to a friend that has Verizon and a different phone they'll have at least two more ""bars"" than I have and never drop calls. Even when my phone shows three bars I'll drop a call. I have updated the software several times and delt with Verizon's ""Costomer support"" (Ha) several times neither of which made a difference. They (Either Verizon or LG, I'm not sure which) have also made it very difficult to transfer pics and ringtones to and from the phone without an extra charge."
1,Where's my newspaper?,"Just started the trial subscription. Got the first 3 mornings' papers delivered to the Kindle, but for the last 3 days, have not received any papers at all."
1,It was not what I asked for,I wanted genuine leather and this was not that it is just paper bound that looks like leather. The description was not true.
1,Disappointing,"I just purchased this product and have to say I am very disappointed with it. As stated in another review...the water doesn't seem to flow evenly over the dome without having to prop it. Also, the handle that fits on the top doesn't stay secure, so when I try lifting it, the handle falls out and the dome drops. I have a Petmate for my ""porch"" cat and thought I'd try something different for my inside cats. The concept is great, but I think it would work better if the dome was smaller and it had a larger reservoir around the dome. I will be returning the fountain tomorrow & will pay the 10-20 extra dollars for a Petmate or Drinkwell."
1,New balance Mens SD 100 Sandal,"They are a little stiff, should have smoother edges around the area you slide you foot in. Not very comfortable."
1,"Tolstoy rocks, Oprah's imprimatur does not!","Low star number is for the style of the cover. I am fed up with ""Oprah's Book Club"" getting blasted on the cover of all my favorite classic novels - and her newly-added world literature titles, too. I am not judging Tolstoy's writing style! The book is a wonderful journey for the reader.Is there some reason why, if publishers (and presumably amazon as well) want to push a title with the selling point of Oprah's recommendation, they cannot affix one of those slightly sticky labels that can be peeled off? Price stickers on book covers appear all the time. It is a great thing that more people are reading and that they are discovering old gems and for that Oprah deserves loads of praise. But get off the cover! You did not write the book."
1,Stuck Pixels and uneven backlighting,"I know that for the price paid for the item, that I shouldn't expect miracles, but seriously... 2 stuck pixels and the uneven backlighting on this monitor are completely crappy. It doesn't even produce that great an image over DVI. I have yet to get fed up and switch it to see if it works any better on an analog connection, so if I ever do it, I'll update my review.I have a viewsonic Q20wb which I use at work and it's flawless...beautiful backlighting for great black-level performance, no stuck pixels, and great color calibration.The Acer just doesn't live up to the hype... Spend 20-30 bucks more for something better."
1,AVOID THIS PRODUCT!,"I'v actually had this a little over a year. Last week it just quit.If mine was the only one that died, I probably wouldn't have a problem.My son had the same one and his also quit. I have another son that worksat Radio Shack and they had a customer bring one back because his quit.This seems to be a trend with these devices. I can't speak for anyone else,but if I spend that kind of money on something, I expect it to last morethat a year and a half.Sorry guys.. Three strikes and you're out."
1,Braun Series 7 -790cc Pulsonic Shaver,"Purchased june 15 2009. Battery shot already, have to shave with cord attached. E-mailed company, no reply."
1,Psychology from the 1980s,"This video, as far as I could tell, had absolutely nothing to do with the powers of the mind. All of the other reviews are either misleading or completely false. There was no man jumping off a building and accomplishing some supernatural feat. Here's a short synopsis of what this video actually is: A bunch of psychologists and neuroscientists from the 1980s talk about the brain, while the host of the program attempts to make everything sound really mysterious.This movie would have gotten 2 stars if it had at least said on the box ""This video is about the various 'natural' functions of the brain and has absolutely nothing to do with the 'supernatural' powers of the mind."" That, at least, would have been honest. If you are looking for a video on the powers of the mind, save your [PRICE} and don't buy this one!"
1,No homerun with this toy,"This toy does not hold my 15 month olds interest. She does walk around with the ball, but that's about it. The toy is much smaller than I thought it would be. It's collecting dust."
1,"Walk me up when it's over, will you?","I didn't care for the first one and could barely stand this one. I like movies with some excitement and fantasy in them. Where is the entertainment in this movie? If I want to see two people blabbing on and on, I could like see them in this movie. Maybe that's the point of this stupid movie. Sorry, I take the ""stupid"" part back. It's just a dumb movie. I am sure it works for people who might have failed in relationships, people who are lonely, or people can't communicate. The world is full of folks who actually find meanings in a movie -- any movie -- even this one."
1,Breaks Very Easily,My 4 year old has tons of Thomas trains but this is the first one I think is real garbage. He got it yesterday for his birthday and the lorry bed came off in his hand within a few seconds. It has these stupid little pegs to keep in on that don't hold with anything but require more fine motor skills to reattach than a 4 year old has. Shame on the manufacturer for making such a poorly designed piece of junk and selling it for so much money.
1,Watery,This is a watered down fake bottle of Biosilk. The real one is thicker and smells a lot better than this one.
1,"A war against sanity, more like!","This is more like a war against sanity than a war against dogma and narrow-mindedness. It is completely crack-pot stuff, and anyone who parts with hard-earned money to buy it, thinking to be led to some new revelation, is to be pitied. The alleged ""scholarship"" is dead wrong, the ""scientific"" methodology either laughable or non-existant, depending on one's point of view, and the overarching premises simply crazy.It is a sad commentary on our level of education when utter garbage like this can be peddled to the credulous.Proves that if you keep an open mind people will throw all their crap in it."
1,fire the guy who created this!,"my two sons wanted this toy more than anything else for Christmas because a friend just loved it, so we ordered two different models. unfortunately, they are on the same frequency (!!???!!) so my sons cannot play together. we tried one on the third floor and another in the basement but each remote completely controls both cars.it's the first remote toy that we've bought in the last 5 1/2 years that doesn't offer an additional frequency so two kids can actually play together, so it just sits gathering dust because my children hate this toy!plus, THEY DON'T WORK WELL OUTDOORS AT ALL, just stalls and tips over in the grass, and gets stuck behind every single pebble it encounters. a complete waste of money unless you're a single child family and live in the city where it could possibly be used on sidewalks since it doesn't perform anywhere else."
1,Leaks Badly!!,What a disappointment!!The Fuel distribution cap has leaked fuel even though the vent cap is closed . I'm lucky it didn't blow up my shed!!
1,Awful Mockumentary,"I saw part of this moronic documentary on cable once, and for years I thought the the White Stripes must be a horrible band. Just this week I heard some of their songs, and now I realize that this documentary was a terrible rip-off of this band, and an awful negative mark against the band. I wonder how many others have seen this on cable and decided that White Stripes must be a waste of time and money?"
1,A friend of Phil Robinson's,"I did not see the theatrical release of the film and was anxiously awaiting the DVD. Much to my disappointment it is onlyoffered in the widescreen format.On my 27 inch TV I get to see only 9 inches of viewing area, so puchasing the DVD would be a big waste!It's a real shame that the television receiver industryhas not kept up with the DVD format(unless I want to shell out3,000 dollars for a new receiver). I won't be buying any DVDs when I have to squint to see the movie."
1,LUCKY mag deceptive and scary subscripton tactics,"Think twice about subcribing to this magazine. After my subscription has ended I decided not to renew (magazine contents has just really turned for the worse) but these people will keep sending invoices that makes it appear you are ""past due"" on paying the subscription and that you have to pay to be in ""good credit standing"". BEWARE! I have read too in the internet about people getting calls from credit collection agency due to these types of invoices; just google it for more info."
1,Flimsy construction,"Bought this product for my 70-pound Boxer. I set it up and he loved it! However, within a month of daily use, the joints started to bend. After 6 weeks, it was completely broken. The joints bend easily, despite this being sold as a bed for ""large breed"" dogs. I actually bought two of these beds - one lasted for about 2 months before falling apart, the other lasted about two weeks."
1,Dead,"Bought this June of 2010. Not even a year since and the pack no longer recharges. I use the cord to power my controllers. That works fine but the battery packs are horrible. Even when charged, it was constantly warning me of a low battery half way through the charge. Very annoying when playing a game to see the xbox button flashing in my face. I treat my stuff like gold and cycle batteries properly. This pack has ended up being worse than my rechargeable batteries. I can't recommend this item. I'm probably going back to lithium until they make a rechargeable battery that actually has a decent shelf life."
1,Biggest POS ever,"If you have already cut your circular hole in the door before you realize what a piece of crap you just bought, check out the You Tube video on how to assemble this abomination from the manufacturer, as it gives a couple of instructions that the unhelpful diagrams do not, including using TAPE to hold this mess in place. Staywell owes me four hours of my life back."
1,One of the Worse operating systems I have used.,"I have been using computers for about 28 years and have used DOS, OS-2 and the different versions of Windows. I have had problems from the start. I have not been able to get the networking to work at all for this version of Linux. Setup of the operating system was easy but to change settings is difficult. This turns me off to the Linux Operating system. I have used Windows for years and have been able to fix problems. I would recommend that someone may want to try another brand of Linux. I read a review by someone else who was not crazy about Redhat Linux 9.0 I recommend you stay away from this if you are not farmilar with Linux.The Vendor I purchase this from I would give a 5 for they were very prompt. My complaint is with Redhat and not the Vendor of this product."
1,Buyer Beware!!! Deceptive Advertising.,"***BUYER BEWARE*** The photographs associated with this item, the Stoney Point Stix II, will lead you to believe that you will receive two stands - a tall one and a short one. Both are pictured in the list thumbnail photo and both are pictured when you open the item description. For the additional ten dollars that would be a good deal. ***BUYER BEWARE***. When I received my shipment all that I received was a SINGLE SHORT BIPOD. The item I was shipped is no different than the other short bi-pod I own already, except for the camo finish. DO NOT SPEND THE EXTRA $10.00 THINKING THAT YOU WILL RECEIVE TWO BI-PODS. You will receive the same equipment that you would get by purchasing the item listed for $22.68. ***BUYER BEWARE***."
1,"Good for tracing, not for photographing negatives",I bought this product to display negatives that I would be listing on Ebay. The fluorescent bulb in this unit makes it impossible for my digital camera to focus and take a proper picture. Completely useless for this purpose.
1,Ok.,"This is an in-your-face, hackey-slashey, gory, action adventure movie. Or at least it tried to be. ""Starship Troopers"" was needlessly gory, not that I didn't like it, but it just got graphic to the point where it was stupid. But I like bloody movies, so it's all good. Should've gotten an Oscar for best make-up."
1,its no good,"its no good, it don't wert a doller and a piece of rag could do a better job, thats the truth."
1,Very pleased so far--UPDATED; NOT PLEASED,"I've had these bulbs installed above my tortoise enclosures for about two weeks now. They are much brighter than the Exo Terra lights I had previously. This is my first attempt at using Zoo Med lights and I like them so far. My tortoises seem to enjoy basking under them as well. Right now I have them in a normal inustrial clamp style lamp from a big box store. However, I will be buying theZoo Med Combo Deep Dome Dual Lamp Fixturefor theZoo Med ReptiCare Ceramic Infrared Heat Emitter 150 WattsI have.Update 10/29/12: After less than 4 months of having these lights on a 12-hour daily timer they have both burnt out. I've never had a reptile light last so short of time. I would not recommend this light. I will be order two of these:Exo Terra Repti-Glo 10.0 Compact Fluorescent Desert Terrarium Lamp, 26-Watt. It only merrits 1 star and that would be soley based on it's price point."
1,Pointless....,"This movie was just dumb, but some parts were funny that why it got 2 stars. It seems like the move was trying too hard to be the next Bill & Ted...but you know that's not gonna happen."
1,Very disappointed.,"A large portion of the book was not in the movie at all. If I didn't read the book first, I wouldn't have understood it at all."
1,Try Something Else,The front cover picture is deceiving as it was the best picture in the whole book! I found the pictures to be mediocre at best and I am sure there are better artists out there. I also thought it did not include enough pictures. The Watercolor Faeries book looks much more interesting.
1,A handy vac would do a better job,"For those that are thinking of buying this to 'clean up their neighborhood'- don't buy this thing. I did and it was a mistake. I've had this for several years now and despite the many funny reviews, a handy vac would do a better job than this machine. It doesn't vacuum, it doesn't sweep the streets, it doesn't empty the garbages. In fact, the rust color actually adds to the trashy look of the neighborhood. Hence the lower rating.If you are looking to buy a vehicle to take with you on your trip to NYC then this might be appropriate. If you are looking to go tour a strange country, then this might be a fine vehicle, depending on the country. But otherwise, I'd give it a skip.It is an expensive vehicle that drives so slowly you won't want to use it for the quick run to the grocery store, it doesn't 'clean up the neighborhood' and it is tight and cramped inside."
1,"Alien Not, Again","Good science fiction movies are hard to come by. I wanted to like this movie, I really did, but I just couldn't. It is filled with cliched characters, story gimmicks from other movies (""borrowed"" from Avatar, Star Wars, Star Trek) and a female character who pants, moans, and screams her way through the whole thing. It just got too much, and the pay off was ludicrous. When Ridley Scott is good, he is very, very good - but when he is bad, he is unbearable. I recommend you skip this."
1,TERRIBLE TERRIBLE printer!!!,"I will never buy another Epson printer as long as I live. The printer has a mind of it's own and tells you when it's ""out of ink"" even when the ink cartridge is half-full and won't let you print anything else until you replace it... and the ink cartridges are EXPENSIVE!If that weren't bad enough, our printer flat out STOPPED WORKING after 18 months of use!!! It STOPPED IN THE MIDDLE OF A PRINT JOB and gave an error message telling us that the parts in the printer were at the end of their service life, even though the pages from the first half of the print job looked fine. It will not print anything else until we replace the dumb parts. IF YOU BUY THIS PRINTER, YOU WILL SPEND A LOT OF MONEY ANF NOT GET VERY MUCH USE OUT OF IT!SOOOOO NOT WORTH IT!!!I honestly would not accept another Epson printer if they PAID me to!"
1,Sick and disturbing... it's alarming so many people found this an entertaining read.,"Just couldn't bring myself to finish this extremely disturbing read. Yes the strange dialect of funky slang is very off putting at first, but that is the least of my problems with this book and something a chapter or so in you start to become accustom to. Now, by the time I got to chapter 4, wherein main character 15 year old Alex, rapes two 10 year old girls (mind you this takes place the day following a home invasion and gang rape performed by the young narrator and his pals) I was done. I know Clockwork Orange is a cult classic and all, but this is just not entertainment, at least not in my opinion."
1,"Good in places, bad in others","The book had a promising premise: gang life for two boys in a marginal neighborhood trying to forge their own identities in the face of a world that shows them contempt.But this premise fell flat. There were several sections that were good, such as the sections where Tomas trains the dogs and when Gabe runs away. But I thought neither of the boys were completely developed as characters. There were several elements that I thought were left out: any sort of romantic life for the younger brother, thoughts about their father who abandoned them, and any interactions among Tomas, Gabe and any of those who were in Tomas' gang. These seemed like odd omissions, and therefore the book was strong in places and weak in others.One nitpicky detail: there were several items about Los Angeles that the book got wrong, e.g. calling Abbott Kinney Boulevard Abbott Kenny Street."
1,Handheld Portable Scanner,"Seems like an awesome idea. Very small and portable. If you only have a page or two occasionally it would be OK, but much more than that use something else, though not sure what if you're traveling.Two main problems.1) It keeps cutting off, and2) getting the scan straight is very difficult.If you pause for any length of time the scanner shuts completely off, then you have to go through the process of restarting. This causes your scan to end saving what is done up to that point in a file. In essence you have to start over. This is very anonying.Because the scanner is so lightweight, it is very difficult to guide it straight, thus the image is distorted. For my use, massive amounts of continuous paper (well logs), just didn't work. Price is right though. Finally sent it back."
1,overmike,"I like to listen to an opera with balance between the orchestra and the singers. But the singers are so closely microphoned that I can't see it as being correct.The orchestration is Salome. Nilsson is also Salome. But I find her voice too bright. It is gigantic, but it has the tone of an oversize Roberto Peters. Also her edginess is a bother.I prefer Kirsten Flagstad."
1,Not that impressed,"I bought this can opener just about a year ago and out of the blue, it just stopped working. There is power through the cord but the opener just doesn't work. Cuisinart products usually last longer and are better quality than this item. I would not purchase another one of these."
1,get what you pay for flashlight,Only works correctly for a short time then you have to tap it or hit it to make the light come on and then a few seconds later it goes off and you have to repete the process.
1,Watered down Whirlwind...,"Unfortunately, James Clavell and his publisher fought during the last few years of his life. The result was that his final Asian saga novel, Whirlwind, is out of print. Escape is a watered down version of that novel, developed for a movie script. The core story is still there, but to get Clavell's intended story, buy Whirlwind at a used bookstore or online auction site."
1,Lots of back stories!!!,This book is very good. Five short stories providing the backstories of the galaxies most notorious bounty hunters. The best is the Boba Fett backstory!
1,Brilliant shallow patriotism,"For those who wonder ""why do they hate us?"", look no further and read this book."
1,bad casting decision,"I'm a big fan of Hitchcock but this film just doesn't work for me and the reason for that is the casting of Cary Grant in the main role. In order for this film to work you have to be able to buy Cary Grant as a possible murderer. I mean, it's CARY GRANT. You know he's not going to murder anyone. As a consequence there's no tension in this movie at all because you know he's innocent from the get-go. Now if they had given Joseph Cotton the role things would have been different."
1,Could've been better,"As an ardent reader of legal fiction and a dedicated fan of Mr. Grisham's writing, I was very disappointed with this book. The main character, Michael Brock, was unbelievable and predictably swayed toward the PC social commentary depicted in this novel. Some characters were very well done (ie. Mordecai Greene and Ruby, the addict). In fact, I cared more for them than the story's protagonist. The first few chapters were wonderful, but the story declined from there as Brock began his downward spiral into the dregs of society. Also, the courtroom battle lacked any strong energy or interesting characters, as found in The Runaway Jury or The Rainmaker. Read this book in paperback form. It's not worth the hardcover price. Sorry, John."
1,Bloody sunday,"Not really up to my expectation and I'm not impressed, there was no historical background on the Bloody Sunday, mainaction in the movie were streetfightings, killings etc. Would not recommend."
1,"Heaven, by Randy Alcorn","Highly recommend this well researched investigation of what the Bible has to say about Heaven. Much is extrapulation and conjecture, but the author's views are explained thoroughly. Very uplifting, even life-changing."
1,"Boring, Discusting and Pointless----DON'T WAST YOUR MONEY",It is a big mistake to buy this film...I don't see any drama in it...you will sleep if you saw this film. And the sex seen is so long...I don't beleive that some one loved this movie!!!!!
1,The description is misleading!!!,"As the person stated above, it only fits accessories if they are WITHIN the camera!!Because there is only space for the camera body- nothing else. It's very frustrating. I really need to find a different case.Plus, the leather is really hard and plasticky."
1,Horrible side effects,It's not worth it. Abdominal pain. Uncontrollable gas. Oily discharge that is a mess and hard to wash off. And the close calls to pooping in your pants. Be near a bathroom 24/7. read the other 1 star reviews.
1,Marine Aquarium lacks what Dream Aquarium Provides,"If you are looking for a realistic fishtank you should consider Dream Aquarium. The movement in Marine is hokey and not realistic at all. Reading the forums from the programmer I am left feeling that the programmer doesnt have any good customer relations as he seems to indirectly tell his customers that are unhappy ""BYE"" and seems to complain alot about eating peanut butter. Personally I want my money back and will spend any future monies on Dream Aquarium. I recommend to anyone looking for a realistic fish screensaver to try out Dream Aquarium and avoid Marine Aquarium like the plague."
1,"Boring, not realistic","First of all, any movie with Vin Diesel should tell you right off the bat that it's gonna be bad. And this movie is BAD. Spielberg was always a pretty overrated director. This movie isn't as bad as ""E.T.,"" but it's not realistic. The first 20 minutes look like a PlayStation movie. For a more accurate depiction of the horrors of war, check out the amazing ""Pearl Harbor"" with Ben Affleck."
1,Take it or Leave it...,"In my opinion, it isn't worth paying for this book--all the same information is available, for free, at their website. I bought a ton of wedding books--and never used them becaue I had all I needed online for free. If you aren't a computer-y person, then go for it...but if you know how to browse websites, save your money for the centerpieces, photography, or other wedding detail."
1,You get what you pay for!,"What a hunk of junk! I managed to find this ""great system"" for under $100 and it's not even worth half that! I guess it would be okay for a teen in his room but do not fool yourself into thinking that this would be a good or even fair home theater system because it is not! I feel guilty even giving this thing one star because it doesn't even deserve it! Take your money and invest it in a system that isn't a piece of crap."
1,Quality Product but doesn't work right,"My sister-in-law is an audiologist and showed me how to use this tool appropriately. The bulb isn't strong enough to generate enough light to reflect light off the eardrum, therefore, it's not really all that useful. The quality of the instrument itself is well made and very durable, however, it doesn't work for what I need this for."
1,Poor quality video copy,"Like the other reviewers of this video (Westward Ho the Wagons)Westward Ho, I saw this film in the theater. I recall a delightful Disney production with typical Disney production values. The video copy that I received (at a rather steep price) was a very poor quality copy of a television production that itself had been cut to fit a TV time slot.The commercial breaks were obvious and badly blended into the video. The sound was poor and the picture quality was bad (almost colorless) in as much as it was washed out. The video appears to be a copy of a copy, not worth the $30 plus that I paid. I would strongly recommend that Amazon shoppers avoid the particular video vendor when considering future purchases.James P. Hoban"
1,I wish i had not bought this game,"although it was a popular game, i thought it was not good at all, the graphics really are bad. :("
1,Broke in two,"The bit used to make the tenons broke in two. So far they wanted me to send the bit to them, but i'm in the middle of a job, will do that later. Asked them if they could sell me the one that broke in two, so i can finish the doors i'm making, the answer:""it is not sold individually""."
1,"This Cake Must Come Baked, With Frosting & a Pound of Caramel","This must be a joke, $32.28. Please correct this mis-print. I wanted to try the Caramel Cake mix. But only when the correction has been made with the price. Does Duncan Hines have it like that?"
1,KC light covers,"This item was misrepresented. It shows in the picture that the letters are small, but when we received them, the KC letters took up the entire surface. I was very disappointed, as was my son when he opened them for Christmas."
1,"I love Shania, but...","As a country fan, I enjoyed her last 2 or 3 albums. They were very poppish, but had country themes and instruments. With this most recent release, she's lost all semblance of country and stepped energetically into pop. I wish her luck. But, as a fan of her last few albums, she's lost me. If you are a country fan that enjoyed Shania, it's probably best you listen to this album before you buy. My copy is already given away.Wes Y. Keller"
1,Not a good deal,These towels are not a good deal. I guess you get what you pay for. We purchased the navy blue towels and they shed a lot. They also filled the dryer with fuzz and look horrible after just one wash. We have thrown them in the trash after one use. NOT RECOMMENDED!
1,All of you got ribbed off....You have to pay for this ???,"This was a 1 page instruction in my kung fu manual.Wow, it is so easy to make money in America,maybe I should translate books too andsay I am a master.Go to Baidu and search videos for'''''"
1,Only 4 full size logs out of 100 pieces,"We purchased this set because it had 100 pieces and we thought that it would have close to 100 full size logs similar to the set we remembered when we were children. Unfortunately our set had only 4 full size logs and the rest small pieces as connectors. This set was not at all what we expected, and we would not have bought it had we known that it had only 4 logs like the ones we remembered."
1,Don't order this set,I ordered this set & when it arrived the plastic lids were cracked. I returned it for another set & those lids were cracked also. I have a nice set of Revere bowls bought from a Revere store. These are not the same quality.
1,Mundane and academic - too thin,A few good ideas stretched over way too many pages. No one will argue with the quality of the thought -- it's just that there isn't enough here to fill a book. Save your money.
1,"Clean mids and highs, but no bass","If you like the sound of good quality bookshelf speakers - with the woofers removed - you'll love the ER6i's. There's a whole ritual involved in getting them inserted correctly (the casual observer might think you're having a seizure) and even the slightest difference in the way they're inserted causes significant changes in the sound, which goes from thin to thinner. Etymotic claims audiophile pleasing accuracy, but I don't consider it accurate when you completely chop off the whole lower end of the audio spectrum.The wires russling against your clothing cause an distractingly loud noise in your ears as well.I bought the Ultimate Ears SuperFi 5 earphones a few weeks after giving up on the Etymotics and, even though the price of the UE's is somewhat higher, the quality and extended range of their sound (full, deep, balanced bass, warm mids and clean highs) made it well worth it to me."
1,Intollerant of other people's problems,"I have to agree with Dobsons premise that God is forgiving but not tolerant of sin. But example gives credibility and his own failed marriage is but another example of ""whatever"". Of course he is faultless and it was all her problem...as usual.Edward"
1,broken after 6 uses,"may be a fluke, but this expensive crockpot broke after six uses...it's been three months and I'm still waiting for a replacement from the manufacturer..."
1,not what I expected,"""cage"" was VERY small (when assembled, about 18 inches in diameter. I need at least 2 more to do what I need it to do, and should have spent the money for a bigger one from the get-go"
1,Wanted to like it so......,"Had always considered ""Emporer"" and 'Palace Thief"" to be two of most satisfying collections of short stories I've ever run across - so was terribly excited to read ""Kings and Planets"" and, like most of these reader reviews are stating, it just didn't work. Normally, I'd say - read it cause he's a brilliant writer, but if you know his stuff then save yourself from this disappointment. ALSO - what was the deal with the damn typeface? - there was this consistent extra space after a certain and often used word which now escapes me - let's just say - I put this whole experience out of my mind!!!!!"
1,Avoid!,I listened to this one twice before relegating it to the dust bin. It almost hurts to listen to it -- especially for old Dokken fans. Even George Lynch isn't impressive.
1,produces smoky smell,"After about 15 minutes of use, my lamp starts to smell like there's going to be a fire. I took the bulb out of my lamp (660W, 250V), and the bulb has some sort of silver stuff on it that looks like it has melted and burnt part of the metal."
1,Enough already!,"This is the book that Mr. Jordan finally lost me on. I faithfully slogged through the previous 8 overlong volumes, but I have finally had my fill.We could've gotten to this point in the story after 4-5 books, it certainly doesn't merit 9. Way too long, overly detailed, extreme lack of anything happening for at least a book or two. Was an editor assigned to this series, or does whatever he churns out make it into the final print?I particularly dread the sequences with the ""Forsaken"". Does anyone find these at all interesting or compelling?Another point-if you're going to have a series with about 5000 characters, please put a complete character index in each volume. I grew tired of reading a 30 page chapter on some character that hadn't appeared in the series for 5 volumes and not having the faintest idea of who exactly they were, and why I was supposed to care about them. Jeez."
1,Sharing the Misery,"I picked up ""1185 Park Avenue"" looking forward to insight on growing up Jewish on Park Avenue in the 1940's/1950's. Instead I found myself drawn into Anne Roiphe's remarkably dysfunctional family, where no individual escapes unscathed from this hellish home. I found the memoir to have no redeeming message or purpose, except to let Ms. Roiphe express her rancour at her unfortunate circumstances. What bothers me most is that in becoming so engaged in the sadness and anger of her family story, these negative vibes served to make me upset too. Another triumph of evil over redemption."
1,"LA MENCANCIA ESTA EL DORAL, POR RECHAZO DE TC, POR FAVOR VERIFICAR","ESTA CALIFICACION ES DEBIDO A QUE EL PAQUETE ESTA RETENIDO, ME INDICA QUE RECHAZAN CARGOS A LA TARJETA, VERIFICANDO MI ESTADO EL PRODUCTO ESTA DEBITADO DE LA MISMA."
1,Wasn't Impressed,I was not impressed with the pilot and probably will not watch again. It just wasn't entertaining as True Blood or Twilight. I think maybe we have enough different vampire shows to keep us entertained that we do not need another.
1,unappealing to most,"This movie is geared for a specific audience of pre-teen girls, and if you are not in that target group, this movie is quite stupid. I didn't find it funny. Martin Lawerence plays an overprotective father whose daughter is going to college. He wants her to go to school close to home, but she wants to go to Georgetown. They decide to take a road trip to Georgetown for her interview. Her young brother and his pet pig hitch a ride too, and they must overcome several mishaps to get to Georgetown in time for the interview. From skydiving to a pig on caffeine; it was just silly.FINAL VERDICT: A terrible Disney film."
1,a boring tape,"After seeing some customer reviews, I have decided to buy this tape. However, I feel terribly sorry and the tape is very boring."
1,Horrible,"i bought this camera off ebay and the pictures turned out very poor. the outdoor pictures were great, but the indoor pictures (even with a light as bright as a hospital light) still turned out grainy. The webcam pictures were also very very grainy and i couldn't get 1 clear picture on it.i only recommend this camera for outdoor use. luckily, i'll be receiving an Intel Pocket PC Camera sometime today or tomorrow. THEN my pictures will come out CLEAR.do not buy this camera."
1,STP goes Pop...,"What a mistake it was to buy this CD. This is one of those CD's that has 1 or 2 good songs on it. I was expecting the usual STP hard rock that made them famous, instead this CD is 90% ""STP does Pop music"". I wish I could take it back to the store...If you like Pop music, you may like this CD. If not, don't buy it..."
1,did not like this book!!,"The only other Wolfe I have read is the Right Stuff, and it was excellent. But this book drove me crazy!! I read the first third and then skipped to the last third of the book, just hoping even one of the characters would develop some redeeming qualities. I was disappointed when none of the characters were even likable (I don't expect saintliness in my characters, I love flawed characters, but characters still have to be LIKABLE). I graduated from a small, Midwest state school 8 years ago, and although there was plenty of sex, alcohol, etc., there were other things too- learning, friendship building, etc. Some parts of the novel rang true, but overall, I was disappointed."
1,Obviously a beta.,"This game obviously isn't a finished product. It's full of glitches, and bugs. It is hardly worth more then ET for the Atari 2600.It isn't worth it, even if you want a time wasting game. It's supposed to be a racing game, but it isn't. Your opponent doesn't even move. There is a fixer that you can download, but even then you always win. And when you do, you get greeted by a delightful "" YOU'RE WINNER ! "". You can easily move off track, and nobody would care. You can FLY THROUGH NOTHING. This game has no barriers, you can even pass through everything, including bridges. You can even run thousands of miles in a circle, and stop in a microsecond.If you want to get the game for a laugh, buy it, but buy it somewhere else. It's overpriced on Amazon."
1,What a disappointment,I usually find both if these actors funny...but this was lacking humor. Movie hopes for an audience that doesn't think. It's like they didn't even try. I fell asleep half way through out of boredom. Sorry I wasted $3.99.
1,san disc,I was not truly impressed with both of the discs I received as one did not function properly. Since I was in a time sensitive situation I did not return the product. I ordered it from Amazon and received it in a timely manner and was able to complete my task since I ordered two discs and therefore had a backup.
1,"No no no, Mercury Records! Shame!","Do NOT buy this record. Buy the music Chuck Berry recorded for CHESS records. Seek out ""The Great 28"" for a fantastic greatest hits package--or anything on Chess, for that matter. But do not waste your money on lousy re-recordings of eternal classics."
1,difficult to play - multi player option is difficult,"I bought this because of the 4star review. Unfortunately - this game is not that much fun. The games are familiar, but the controls are difficult at best, and frustrating at worst. I would say save your money.At least the single player mode allows you to pick your games. Maybe I am missing something, but the multi-player game dictates your play and is irritating. Just our opinion."
1,Dino Bashing,"I have been a Patricia Cornwell fan for many years. One of the things I always loved about her character, Kay Scarpetta, was her relationship with Dino. This new book, The Last Precinct, should be a last.... Where is the loving, loyal Kay? This one is mean, heartless and whines, whines, whines.....Poor Dino can do nothing to please her. His gruff demeanor, which was once written with such love, has become vendictive. Ms. Cornwell's lesbian lifestyle is well known, but when did she become a ""man-hater""? She disappoints all of her longtime fans with this book which portrays Dino as an olf, Lucy as a rich quitter and Kay as an unfocus wretch. Please Ms Cornwell, write a book which reflects the talent of your earlier works....."
1,too heavy,"I am nearly finished with this book, and I still waiting for Ms. Morrison to finally disclose what she is trying to say. I want to read novels for comfortable enjoyment. This book certainly doesn't meet that criteria. It is more in line with a heavy college textbook. I would certainly not recommend it for relaxed reading."
1,Not enough information,"While I don't own this book, I would never buy it online with the way you presented it. To buy a music book, you need not only to see an index of the songs included, but also a few pages out of the book (even if not from the same page if you don't want to provide too much free content)... The reason for this is music can be too easy and too difficult to play. The worst feeling in the world is getting a book you ordered online only to find it is too boring to play because the music is too easy, or too difficult to play so it just stands on the bookshelf waiting for a more proficient player. Please provide us with more, this is true of all your sheet music."
1,The MLB Got This One Right,"A foul-mouthed, salacious, well-cast, occasionally entertaining, slice-of-life look at some Chicago Cub (Bruins) fans. Although the ensemble acting is effective and the movie has some satisfying moments, the merits don't outweigh the liabilities for me. I would love to be a bleacher bum at Wrigley Field, but if I sat anywhere near this set of fans, it would diminish my enjoyment. These are the Bleacher Barbarians, and the movie's treatment of a mentally unbalanced fan and his menacing of a player is disturbing. I would love to watch a game with the two old guys in the scoreboard, but they are only in the film for a few moments. In short, the movie doesn't have enough to redeem its winking at antisocial behavior, including compulsive gambling, and the MLB was wise to withhold its approval. I would love to watch the Cubs, but the Bruins not so much."
1,Be careful not to trim your eyelashes off!,"Word to the wise, be extra careful when trimming your eyebrows. The head is so long that I accidentally trimmed my eyelashes! Not the look I was going for.(The mini head broke, which is why I was attempting this with the big head)."
1,Hokey,"I found this movie to be hokey as hell, and the acting was second rate. But as escapist fare, it was also great fun."
1,Epson Techinical Support,"I am sending the Epson Stylus Photo 890 back. I could not make it work, I called Techinical Support which is a toll call,the lady I talked to was very rude, did not know how to help, called her superviser, they told me to call my camera company to get help. It was obvious that it was the printer that was at fault as it would not follow settings. I was very dissappointed. dkuhlmann@huntel.net"
1,...but where's the story?,"If you want a LOT of scaffolding (""Of course you know, doctor..."") then this is for you. He takes a great premise and blows it completely with a lot of background that is quite obviously what he REALLY wants to write about, characters so cardboard John Grisham would be envious, and clockwork schoolboy sex fantasies. I hope he's a better lawyer than he is a writer. What I want to know is, where the hell are the editors who let this stuff get through?"
1,Poor Quality on the Glaze,"I have almost a complete set of dishware and bakeware in the Sango Blue. The items I received over a year ago were all of good quality and arrived in good condition. Sadly, there have been quality and breakage issues with my latest purchases. My casserole dish and lid arrived in one piece, but the lid has several obvious flaws in the glaze on the lid and so is not aesthetically pleasing. I have yet to try baking with it to see how it holds up to heat."
1,gerda's b-day,"I purchased this as a birthday gift for my 83 year old mother-in-law. I thought it would be a fun, different gift. It was definately different - the plant was dead within a week. She didn't tell me until a few weeks later..she didn't want to hurt my feelings. I was extremely disappointed when she told me about the plant."
1,Not exactly a page-turner,"I got this one for Christmas and read it on the plane ride home because it was only slightly more entertaining than the inflight magazine or the guy sitting next to me. Where to start? Two-dimensional characters, implausible plot (how hard is it really to destroy an armoured TRAIN?!!), outrageous coincidences, a hero I couldn't have cared less about, silly and misinformed integration of the Internet into the plot, the list goes on. Its unfortunate because I think the author was onto something good by writing about the dangers of another Stalin emerging from Russia's current crisis."
1,used or refilled,the product came with a used box and the toner was either used or refill. printed out black spot on paper. and need to bought a different one locally works fine. its not my printer's problem.
1,Simply Awful,"I cannot believe how much I disliked this movie. I'm really surprised. So much potential. If only it had a more believeable story and characters worth devoting three hours of my life to. Alas, I found it outlandish and the people cartoonish. The word atrocious actually comes to mind. For some strange reason I kept expecting them to break out into song (DDL in particular). And I kept staring at that horrific ""moustache"" he was sprouting. I'm not usually this harsh, but, God, it was so bad I can't help it."
1,Very Disappointed,"I had always heard that Rowenta irons were very good. I didn't buy the most expensive, but I still had good expectations. I'll take my old Black & Decker iron any day! The Rowenta doesn't get hot enough to iron out any wrinkles on any fabric unless it is on the hottest temp, and then you have to keep nudging the temp control to keep it from cutting off."
1,A tough read,"Although the writer of this book was a teacher she writes less than a page about her experience in that field. Mary Carey is by her own account a journalist. The style of the book is not to my taste. It is choppy and lacks a definitive story line or cohesive theme other than her life and all of the ""famous"" people she knows, herself included.I do not like to read ""endquote"" when the punctuation has clearly conveyed that idea. Pet peeve perhaps but even still the book is not likely to be of interest to the current casual reader.The title of this book piqued my interest, unfortunately it was all downhill from there. If you plan to live in Talkeetna and want to know the history of the era you may find this book useful. Otherwise read it only if you plan to teach in Talkeetna and want to know some early history of the school there or you have an undying curiosity about the author, Mary Carry, as it reads like a bad self-centered gossip column."
1,Is Spencer for Real?,"I choose books-on-tape to travel with that I might not ordinarily buy and read such as mysteries or authors I've never read before or I'm uncertain about. Spencer was one such author. I can't understand how such poorly written garbage can gather the good reviews this book has generated. It makes one question the system. Very poor plot, characters, dialogue, etc. Also, Spencer should pay someone to do her reading for her. Her delivery only made it worse."
1,"Poor Quality, Good Movie","Just to get this straight, the only reason I give this two stars instead of one is because this is a good movie (for Daft Punk fans) and I hadn't owned the DVD.That being said, if you own the DVD, skip this purchase. The 'HD' is more like an upscaled DVD rip. I was looking forward to good bonus features, like interviews with Daft Punk, but they are not here, and the menu for the few bonus features is very confusing. At least on the PS3 I played the movie on, there was no text to describe what the bonus features were. Just a bunch of boxes that did different things.I'd say get this if you don't have the DVD, but try waiting for the price to go down. I'm a huge fan of Daft Punk and I kind of regret the purchase."
1,Failed within two weeks of buying,"Bought this to replace a Rule pool cover pump thinking that it would probably exceed the lifetime of those. I sure was wrong. This unit failed within two weeks of purchase. When I discovered the failed unit it was ""humming"" along but the impeller was not turning. I believe there was something internally wrong with the motor upon manufacture. There really was nothing I could do to fix it. The motor simply failed to turn when the power was supplied to it. I can certainly understand motors failing but not within two weeks. If you decide to purchase ignoring this review be sure to save all receipts and warranty information. A few people seemed to have decent results with this pump. I wish I could say the same and I would be a bit less of a frustrated consumer having wasted my money on this little money pit."
1,Disappointed,Never really had an to opportunity to find out what kind of product this is. Bought this item for my daughter for Christmas. Did not work properly only could see the body of the person.
1,verbose and vacuous,"I admit I only listened to one cassette of a 2-cassette set, but I was very disappointed. There was perhaps 10 minutes of substantive content; the rest of the tape was padded with vague generalizations and painful redundancies. Perhaps the ""meat"" is all on the second cassette..."
1,"BUYER BEWARE - NO NOTES, NO DOCUMENTATION","If you expect any notes or historical documentation that these recordings are authentic, look elsewhere. This is the kind of cheap, bare-bones edition that gives Public Domain a bad name."
1,Sensational Clear Crystal earrings,I do not like these earrings. The earrings are not clear. The color is a very odd shade of yellowishgold. Not Sensational Clear Crystal earrings!
1,not at all like the usual,"This movie was a complete disappointment. I was one of the biggest fans of the original Indiana Joneses. I remember as a kid I would watch the Indiana Jones films over and over again. They were simply a classic to me.I wonder what happened? I don't know but I just don't get it. Reading the reviews around here so many seem to have the same opinion on how this one went completely astray from the originals. Funny how it is, I was thinking to myself finally Hollywood will make a film again worth watching. Not!!"
1,very disappointed,"I was hoping that dispite the negative reviews, that I would be lucky. No such luck. The cd player never worked. Sending it back for a refund!"
1,Barf,I wish I could say this movie sucks but it is nowhere close to being that good. I could not even finish watching this pile of dog poop. Someone pick it up with the pooper scooper and put it in the thrash.
1,Armani code mens cologne,I received this in my newspaper this morning. I opened it up and it smells very womanly. I could not believe it is a mens scent! It smells similar to CK One a female relative of mine wears. The Roca Wear X cologne I bought on a whim recently smells exactly like this Armani Code. If you want something quite manly Drakkar Noir or Lacoste are still good choices.
1,khoi from Dallas Tx,"I purchase this phone for my friend and just have it almost 2 two week .The phone start having trouble when you push it up to talk ,the power went off and i have to turn back the power again ,just happen very often .Phone look nice but i very disappoint the way it happen.I would not recommended buying this product ."
1,Pretty good if you like wet sand!,I thought it was the cutest thing. My two girls played in it and had a ball! The next day it rained and they haven't played in it since. It doesn't dry out and it keeps getting wet when it rains. I think the top doesn't fit good.
1,NOT GOOD,"This one is comfortable, but the fan goes from nearly silent to extremely noisy and distracting within three days. How do I know this? I purchased two as gifts. My best advice is save your money and buy a better product."
1,Not great,The only good thing I can say is I did not fall asleep while watching it. Poorly acted and directed with the question 'are the old cartoon worth changing into movies?' If this answer is movies with little to not plot and extremely poor taste here you have them.
1,STAY FAR FAR AWAY FROM THIS LOST TRICKER!!,"Unlike the previous reveiwer who never used this, I had a chance to. The scope is very spotty, so when you put the saliva slide through, you just see the original spots from the microscope, it does not even matter how much or how little saliva you put onto the tray, or even if you move the tray around. There is no way to clean the microscpe as I tried to. Infact you can see the saliva tray better than putting the tray into the scope. And by the way the comapny might as well be non existant as there is no customer service, no phone # to call, and they do not answer emails. They simply just do not care!"
1,THE NANO IS DEAD!!!,"Here's the deal... Bought this thing a month ago, unpacked it, put a tissue in it and put it underwater overnight, woke up to find a completely dry tissue after being submerged for 8 hours. So, I have been using it for about a month with my iPod Nano. Swimming laps, rockin' out, makes lap swimming fly by.Then this morning I got in the pool at 5:30, put on my headphones and began to swim... by 5:32 my Nano was DEAD. I stopped and looked only to see my screen flashing, the case fill with water and my iPod die before my eyes (how dramatic). After looking at the case, everything looked normal! I am at a loss as to how water got into the thing, and the T seal was IN PLACE!Anyway, I don't recommend this thing at all! Very disappointing! The only good thing about this is that it fried my little nano and not my huge 60 GB model that houses my entire music collection."
1,Caution: Bulky !,Please check the size of the mouse before buying this. It's height is half the width of my laptop. I thougth it would go into my palm by seeing the picture. But finally returned the product due to the unexpected bulky appearance. But it have a very nice modern look !!!
1,XBox 360 Power & Play Charger- DEFECTIVE,"I bought the new Energizer XBox 360 Power & Play battery charger from [...] and it's been a COMPLETE DISASTER.The unit is defective and [...] is ignoring my emails.The charger's lights are supposed to act like the ones on your typical charger- glow red while charging, green when charging is complete. The lights on this unit do nothing, except when the AC adaptor power supply is first plugged in- they flash red/green once, and that's it. The unit does not recharge batteries at all.I bought a brand new set of Energizer rechargeable batteries to use in this thing. When they didn't work I bought another set. The problem is not the batteries. The charger does not work.I'm still waiting to hear from [...] I figure this is a rare occurrence and would be content to exchange this defective unit for one that works. But so far I've sent them several emails without getting a response."
1,Just how 'true' is 'True'?,"This may be the strangest entry yet in the WWE's DVD pantheon. Does anyone out there expect the ""truth, whole truth, and nothing but the truth"" from the WWE, a company that's been, eh, a little less than forthright over the years, particularly about their showcase, Wrestlemania?If Vince McMahon, owner of the company, actually does come forward and fess up to many 'Mania myths, such as the 93,000 people they claim were present for WM III, the most famous of the 26 shows (actual number:78,000); or their sleazy claim that WM VII was moved from the Coliseum in L.A. to the Sports Arena because of 'terrorist fears' (this was in early '91 during the Persian Gulf conflict part 1, and the reason it was moved was due solely to slow ticket sales)...then i'll happily apologize in print for ever doubting the George Washington of pro wrestling himself, Mr Mcmahon. Or is he the Richard Nixon? Remember, both Presidents are famous for 'not lying'."
1,Just a case where the book is tremendously better than the movie,"Love Tilda, she really can't do anything wrong acting-wise. The actor who played Kevin also definitely has potential, but the movie didn't allow him to show it - the book is incredible, incredibly hard to read and really makes you think. Painful that I finished it right before Newtown. Movie could have done a better job with such intense material."
1,"Nice case, but poor tripod.","The case is fine, but the full sized tripod is flimsy. I purchased three for a field project and one broke on first use. Super glue fixed it. Overall, I am OK having made this purchase because the overall cost was reasonable. If you want something that's rugged, however, I'd stay away from this product."
1,Disappointed...,"I bought Aeone's first cd Point of Faith and absolutely loved it so naturally I ran out and bought this one as well. Unfortunately, the music styles on this disc are so radically different I just can't feel the same connection. If you want to try it out, I suggest borrowing it from someone first. My advice, if you loved the musical style of Point of Faith, leave this one on the rack."
1,Sheds like crazy,"I've only used this brush about 3 times, but every time, it sheds quite a bit. One redeeming quality about this brush is that the hair it covers my face in is actually badger hair, I looked but didn't see mention of this in the product description. I am new to wet shaving, so I really don't know if it is normal for brushes like this one to shed, or at least for them to shed so much. More often than not, it really is true that you get what you pay for. I wouldn't reccomend this brush unless you just really need the cheapest one possible, that really is what this one is."
1,You'll go broke buying ink for this machine,"Sure, it's cheap, but you'll quickly make up for that in buying ink. This printer takes 5 separate ink cartirdges, 4 of which must be bought in a pack, so you end up with extras you never use. It will refuse to print if it thinks any of those 5 cartridges have unacceptable ink levels. This has happened to me even on a fairly new cartridge. Even worse, my particular machine often gets confused and tells me I have more than one of the same color installed (I don't). Again, because of this, it refuses to print. I wish I'd never bought this printer."
1,BADMOVIE,Bad bad movie. Really bad movie. A rape of the classic monster characters. Bad movie is also bad entertainment and that`s what this movie really is. Bad bad and once again really bad.
1,didnt catch my eye,"Honestly, I laughed about 2 times. I've laughed more times on Men In Black 2 and I saw the ratings. Oviously some of you didn't like it. Anywayz, I don't think Spy Kids 2 would interest me either. Don't get me wrong, I love action movies, but that movie stunk."
1,Hungry For Batteries,"This was a great toy at first... until I realized that this little hamster sucks the juice out of batteries faster than my kids could play with it. I changed 3 batteries in one week, making sure my kids were always turning it off between uses. Eventually it just stopped working altogether whether or not a new battery was in it. We saved the ball to use with our other Zhu Zhu pets, but this hamster went right to the trash can."
1,Disappointed,The trigger was Impossible to control. The cookie shape quality was inconsistent. Tried a few recipes and cookie temp and texture - nothing worked.
1,Wrong Book!,Some time back I had read A BRIEF HISTORY OF EVERYTHING by Bill Bryson and was really impressed by the book. Enormous amount of information bundled in a nicely written book. Nice to see the exotic information in a single book.I was expecting something similar when I picked this book. Sadly I was wrong. The book is more on author's comments than information. Not my kind of book. Not recommended.
1,Worst piece of hardware i ever got,"software provided in CD doesnt work with vista, not sure why its being sold when it is not supported on new version of windows. i can't download gb's of s/w from internet...i hate to return an item, feel like throwing it but will return as my hard earned money is spent on this.."
1,Don't waste your money!!!,"Should have paid attention to the reviews, I like this scent a lot and used to wear it years ago, but something is off with this fragance now, not sure what it is, and worse of all whatever the scent there is when you spray it on you does not last at all. Not sure if it is too old and lost its potency or if the makers changed the formula, but don't waste your money."
1,needs a window to work,"I bought 3 of these for my office, which has very few windows. It couldn't catch a signal in the rooms I had placed them (kitchen, conference room, and front desk- none of which have windows), so after a week, I returned them and got regular clocks. The atomic technology just doesn't seem worth it when you can buy a regular clock and not have to worry about where you hang it."
1,Don't buy it,"This is the 4th unit they sent me. The coffee it makes is great, the quality of the product is dreadful. The caraf drips coffee all over the counter, the back light on the clock burns out, the hot plate doesn't get hot enough and it stops working in less then a year."
1,It doesn't get much worse,"Low budget homemade movie about vampire midgets who go around attacking people......IT'S AWFUL!! There's minimal action, poor acting, crap for a plot, and the cinematography sucks. I wish people would STOP making their own movies with camcorders!"
1,What's Written in Vegas Should Stay in Vegas.,"I am unable to surgarcoat it. This is a really bad book. There are 14 stories in this book and they are all undeserving of my money. This collection was a real disappointment. The stories are shallow, predictable and utterly fail at engaging the reader. However, in case you need to see for yourself, here is what you will get:1. The Run2. The G-d Gambler3. Las Vegas Courtship4. Bowling with the Christ Child5. The Funniest Thing You Said All Night.6. The Fish Magician7. The Night Uncle Willy's Car Caught Fire on the I-958. Insufficient Funds9. Easy Driving10. Mr. Biondi and the New Dispensation11. Golfers12. Naked City13. Big-City Dtective14. You Saw Me Crying in the Chapel."
1,Worst ending ever!,"The movie was good until the last 5 minutes. It had an intesting twist, but the worst ending ever!"
1,Hate this in so many ways.,"I previously used the Lutron MIR-603THW-WH, but had to ""downgrade"" to this when I moved because the wall switch doesn't control the socket I want. So this item is pretty straightforward, but I really hate it. The remote is pretty junky, the buttons don't work very reliably (maybe 6 out of 10 pushes). The ""dim"" function on the remote steps through discrete levels 1-5 instead of smooth transition, but if you switch on/off it doesn't remember your dimmer level. Also, there is no transition off, it's just abruptly off. And finally, the device doesn't accept a 3-pronged plug (w/ ground) which makes it difficult to run an extension cord. This device may work for someone else, but I'm going to keep searching."
1,Don't waste your money or your time,"I've owned this so-called stud finder for several years and have had better luck using an old magnetic stud finder. Occasionally, this may locate a stud but the only way to prove it is to pound a nail into the drywall. Sometimes it hits wood, most of the time it doesn't. Doesn't matter whether you use the ""deep scanning"" option or the stud option. You get what you pay for."
1,Used To Be The Best...,"The original Leatherman used to be the best thing around until they outdid themselves. I still own this original Leatherman (in any form they are better than the best Swiss Army Knife) but by contrast this version of the Leatherman is awkward and painful to use. If you really need a grip when the item is open the edges of the handle bite into the hand. The blades, as are all tool here, are inside, and nothing locks into place. I strongly recommend picking up almost any other Leatherman than this one, if you really need one you'll be glad you spent the extra money."
1,disappointed!,I was very much looking forward to attaining this product because I am a big fan of Chuck Connors but I was very disappointed due to the poor condition of the slip-case and as a collector who enjoys having his belongings in the best condition possible I chose to return this item.Amazon.com has to excercise better quality control in the area of packaging the items that they ship!
1,Of limited use only.,"I see this tool as the potential ""cherry on top"" of an exhaustive tool collection. My co-worker bought the framer after owning the Impulse trim gun and we just spent the week rebuilding a huge dormer (900 sq feet of roof), putting the framer to the test. My gripes: it overheats, it requires frequent cleaning, it delivers a nail only 80% of the time, it's so precious (expensive) that you have to worry about its safety all the time, can't be used in dusty situations, no hose (so a drop can mean death, if from high enough). Basically this would be the last nail gun I would ever purchase, though if I had lots of spare cash and and a full stable of regular air guns I might just run out and get one for those short, punch-list, small repair type jobs. By the way, I love the Impulse trim gun, Paslode should have stopped there, I just don't think an Impulse framing gun is up to the challenge."
1,It was very consistent. It was very consistent. It was ver,"I find McCullough's writing a bit intolerable. He uses the passive voice quite frequently. Too me, his work reads more like technical documentation rather than descriptive prose. Perhaps this is typical for biography but I do prefer the livelier writing style of Edmund Morris."
1,tacky and pointless,"I checked this book out of the library rather than buying it, thankfully. Virtually every pattern in this cheesy book is available on the author's (equally cheesy) website for FREE, with links to buy materials to make the projects directly from the author. How genius. The information in this book is so fundamental that it is laughable, and easily available for free on the internet with minimal effort. This is just a really dumb book."
1,"Pointless, really.","I ordered these for my wedding day, as I was to be wearing a pair of 6"" platform Jimmy Choos and knew I was in for a day of hell in the foot region.I practiced walking in the shoes for like a month and I had hoped these would at least assist in preventing/relieving the pain associated with torturous shoes - even if it was just a little bit. I did a lot of research and these seemed to be the most highly recommended for high heels.They made the shoes FAR less comfortable than they were without them. They lasted about 5 minutes in the shoes until I tore them out and threw them away. They were awkward to locate as well... (dug into the ball of the foot or were too far up on the heel).Ibuprofen was far more effective."
1,"one year later, it leaks","I bought this to transport soups and stews to work. It keeps things hot for 4 hours if it's full, but mine has started to leak, and I don't like the plastic lid (that probably has BPA) sitting so close to my hot soup for 4 hours. Going to retire it and get an insulated Klean Kanteen."
2,"Good, energetic sax","This live CD is excellent. It's original music by a great, young saxophonist, who puts such energy into his songs. My favorite track on this CD is ""God's Love for Music,"" which starts with a soulful intro by Catalano and becomes energetic jazz. Mighty Burner is an excellent, up-tempo song. Love Bugaloo is another tune that makes you want to dance, which isn't always the case with jazz. All five songs are good.Catalano's following CD, Bang, is a mixture of different kinds of songs, while Mighty Burner is five high-energy tracks. I recommend both if you like jazz. He does a great job of blending modern music with traditional jazz."
2,Good Oral Irrigator ( water pik),"We like this item !!Better to use in our shower, than the old wayin the wash basin."
2,"Cute, quality headband - grownup size","Cute, good quality headband. My girls liked it for pretending to be a panda or mouse. This seems to fit grown-ups, not kids - it fits me, but doesn't stay on my 3 year old and 6 year old girls."
2,As Good as ER Gets,This may be the best season of ER. It definitely beats today's episodes. Compelling stories and great characters.
2,Couldn't Put it Down,"I bought and read the book yesterday. My only problem with it was it ended. When I finished I thought ""Ok when does the next one come out?"" I very much enjoyed the characters and the plot. It was exciting and suspensful but still light hearted. One of my favorite characters from the last book was Muffin and I wish that she was around more in this book. I think I am going to go read it again because it was such a page turner that I probably missed out on some stuff. I cant wait for the next one to come out."
2,"Works well, draws too much power","Although this product works fine once it mounts on your computer, it needs a lot of power. What this means is that you can't plug it into the USB port on your keyboard and expect it to mount on your desktop. it won't... you'll get an error message stating there's not enough power. You literally have to crawl around the back of your entire machine and plug it into the USB port there. (Although I don't think that this is strictly a Lexar Media problem -- I believe that this is the same issue for *ALL* Flash Drives that are 256 MB or greater in size. If you get the 128 MB version of this product, you can plug it into your keyboard.)This product works just fine on Macintosh. [...]"
2,A Great Read for Job Transition and Regaining Employment in Tough Times,"I have to say initially that I don't normally read a book and categorize it as life changing, but this one is. Because of this book, I have regained my confidence, focused on my attributes and have realigned my course for a job search to fill my soul, instead of finding a replacement job for a paycheck. I would daresay this is the best 14.00 I have spent in a long time. Richard Bolles is insightful, intelligent, wise and experienced. I am grateful to him for sharing his wealth of knowledge and experience to help me and everyone through this tough economic time to reassess their worth and their focus! Thank you Richard!!"
2,Musical Fantasy,"A simple score yet melodical and time honoured. It imitates what a painful experience the life of ""Elephant Man"" would have been yet, how beautiful and intelligent was his soul. Musically light, contrasting the relationships he held with many."
2,Platonic blue tooth,I bought this item for my husband. I had bought the same item from a retail cell phone company store and paid twice as much. It works great and came in the same original package that it did when I purchased it in the store.
2,fast service,"As I have not read the book yet, I can't give it a fair review. But I will say, I have had positive communication with the author who suggested I read the book.Because I was taken to task about a review in which I said I had not read the book, I don't feel it fair that I comment further."
2,Surprised by the negative reviews,"I'm very surprised by the negative reviews. I've owned thistoothbrush for about 3 years now--I got it when I got braces. Itworked great then, and it continues to work great. I've never hada problem with the brush heads snapping off (are you putting alot of pressure on it? You shouldn't need to.), nor with bristlescoming off while I am using it (I find it very hard to believeanyone is having a recurring problem like this). I've never had asingle problem with this product, and think it is one of the bestTV infomercial products I have ever seen. I live in fear that Iwill have to go back to a manual toothbrush."
2,Campy & unapologetic fun for friends of Pet Shop Boys,"Several reviewers have complained of this not living up to the hype. Well, what could? I've read reviews that call it 'one of the ages.' That's ridiculous. When The O.C. crowd moves on to the next big thing, FF will lose some of its momentum.And that's okay.This is one to enjoy. FF doesn't try hard to make a statement (e.g. Hives) or start a movement (e.g. Strokes). I'm fans of both those bands, but this is not that. This is period music in the spirit of The Pet Shop Boys, Duran Duran, New Order, and even a little Smiths tossed in for good measure. Not a ripoff, but there are recognizable influences if you were a fan.If you're looking for one for the ages, look elsewhere. But for a lovechild of pop music lineage from the past, it's worth a listen."
2,My Daughters Favorite,"Our of our stack of books, this is my nine month old daughters favorite book. She loves the bright colors and smiles every time we read it."
2,CU-SeeMe Pro is an excellent tool!,"I'm pretty new to computers and when I was given CU-SeeMe Pro for a present, I was a little nervous that it would be hard to use, but it's great! it's been easy to use and quite fun actually! It's very cool how you can see people you are talking to rather than just typing words. and there are some existing rooms you can go to meet poeple. I really like it!"
2,I will follow,"Great CD. Better than Life is Peachy. The songs are more like songs, wich could be a bad thing but this time isn't. There still is the manic drum sound and dark agression, but the songs have more structure and better to follow."
2,Great magazine,I absolutely love the lace projects and the other projects are gorgeous!!! The articles and history are wonderful!! My ONLY reason for 4 stars is that I wish there were more resources for further instruction and materials and tools! Other than that this magazine is stunning and very educational!!!
2,ALMOST as good as Harry Potter.,This is one of the best books I have ever heard. It helped me pass the time before OOTP. I can't wait for the sequel. MFCB starts out and then you find out later in the book how Charlie is connected. I hope you will take this review into thought and get the book from the library or buy it if your parents will.
2,It is fun,"I played the demo at Gamestop too. If you like Samba De Amigo or DDR, you will love this game...but you probably already know that. If you like music and video games, you should like it as well. The drums are a lot more responsive than I originally thought they would be. Great peripheral at a great price. Heck, Samba was $50 and another $80 for the maracas. The drums are included with Donkey Konga."
2,Mikasa salt and pepper shakers,"I purchased this item for my daughter as a Christmas gift to match her china pattern. One of the shakers arrived without a stopper in the bottom and had to be returned. Otherwise, my daughter was delighted to have the set to match her china pieces."
2,It hasn't done anything bad,"Not sure how to review this; I'm no expert on memory cards, but this one seems to have no problems. I've used it for a few weeks without any unexpected behavior. Is that 3 stars? 4 stars? 5 stars?"
2,Skagen Titanium,"This is a very classy watch. Thin and streamlined it cuts a nice line. The crystal fits the body flush which makes for a clean line but because it is flat it reflects any light making the time hard to read and distracting. There is no backlight so this watch is very hard to read at night but it looks so good you don't mind.All in all it is a great watch, very sleek, quiet and the band is very nice. Highly recommend it."
2,Takes some practice,"As another reviewer stated, I wasn't sure what to expect. I've been handing these out among my guitar friends and gotten mixed reviews. For me I hated it the first day. After a while I went back and started playing again and saw a little potential. It is good for easily changing tone and playing a slower song. I get frustrated trying to do anything at an even slightly high tempo, but that's not what they are made for. They are cheap and fun to play with the right songs. I keep various picks in each of my cases and this one has started to earn a spot among the essentials."
2,Fantastic Music!,"If you haven't given them a try, now's the time and choose Costello Music!It's worth every penny in a time when music is rarely worth more than 99 cents for the one song you'll like.I bought this album ONLY because I liked the sound of ""Flathead"" on the Ipod commercial. I thought ""Great, spending 10 bux on a cd I'll like one song from"". WRONG! I quickly fell in love with ""Henrietta"" and now I play the cd almost nonstop on my Ipod and my home PC. It's that good.With some bands you hear them sing and you know they're just mouthing the words (Jayhawks for instance) with the Fratellis you feel the music, energy, and excitement these guys put into their songs. They're true artists!If these guys keep up the energy they'll surely sweep the nation as one of the best bands for 2007. A+ guys!"
2,First prize.,"This book has found a permanent spot in my home, namely, on my desk, where I do all my hobbies. It has loads of great ideas that I've already used. Can't wait for the author's next book --apparantly its a sourcebook on animal designs."
2,Buy two You will be glad you did.......,"As an owner of a lot of Fiestaware this one piece is something I bought two of. One in Sea Mist and one in yellow. The yellow is a light yellow more like a pale lemon. The one thing I noticed right away was how balanced the carafe is when it has liquid in it. Easy to carry and pour from.I think the size of the opening aids in the balance and ease of pouring.We have Fiestaware dinner sets in a variety of colours and use it as our daily dishes as well as outside around the deck and pool and inside for small casual gatherings. The colours are what make these dishes so fun to use and if you have a variety of colours they enliven a table like no other dishes can.The carafe holds a healthy 60 ounces and we have served everything from coffee to french lavander lemonade in ours and the hot liquids stay hot and the cold liquids stay cold, longer. And the item is easy clean as well."
2,Funk meets Dub crossed w/ Deep House & some Jazz....,"This album offers is an insight into the artists and records that have influenced EBTG's music over the last 10+ years. Filled with rich jazz based-soulful hip-hop, funk-filled tracks and deep house rhythms you won't be disappointed. If you are looking for an eclectic album to add to your collection and love any of the types of music listed in this review, then don't delay any longer. Turn up the volume, sit back and enjoy this album, horizontally. Moving in Stereo - d.i.roberts."
2,Endorphins,"If one could drown in endorphins, I would need to wear a life jacket when listening...or should I say... when swimming in these recordings. Words fail...all hail Chopin and Arrau."
2,Kool Trash; very cool; no trash,"For Plimsouls fans (the few and the intelligent) this recording is like rewinding the clock to 1981. Three of the four original members bring you the tell-tale sandpaper tonsils of Peter Case, No Foolin'guitar licks from Eddie Munoz and garage banging drumming of Dave Pahoa. The band has, to it's credit, gone back to the basics that you know and love from the first album. I don't have to tell you anything else except PLAY IT LOUD!"
2,I only wish I could be as patient and helpful,"Problem is I'm a little blind myself. Elizabeth Hartman gives a heartbreaking, but ultimately inspiring performance as a blind girl with a home life so terrible I wanted to reach into the screen and pull her out of there. Luckily, Sidney Poitier enters the picture and teachers her how to take care of herself, showing her how to walk in the city and how to read braille (she's in her twenties).Shelly Winters is absolutely horrifying as her abusive, bigoted mother, and Wallace Ford is heartbreaking as the alcoholic grandfather. A must-see for fans of powerful drama."
2,"Cane Guard Guardian, Narrow Base",I bought this silver quad cane for my 85 year old mom. She has severe arthritis in her knees and this four pronged cane gives her the stability she needs to walk around. She uses the cane everywhere she goes. This cane has given her more independence and mobility. She definitely recommends this cane. The delivery was fast and the price was very good!
2,Nice book,"My daughter is really into the anime, she just loved this book. It is really helping her with her art."
2,"excellent sound, very comfortable","I use these while working and I think the sound is very good and the fit is comfortable. A coworker has a pair of Bose and he says he cannot really tell the difference between the two. (not saying they are as good as Bose, just saying there wasnt an obvious difference in sound quality). They for sure cancel out external noise. Only complaint is after wearing them for several hours (4-5+) they seem to get a tad heavy on the head. But otherwise, very happy with the product and am enjoying the music!"
2,The 61 key full size keyboard BY: CASIO,"This keyboard will be a lot of fun for kids and adults. there are some great features as the 100 songs songbank, 100 instrumental soundbank, an outlet for a microphone, etc. A cheap price for a keyboard this awesome. About 80.00. Most keyboards are in the hundreds and they aren't as much of a value as this. They aren't equipped with nearly as much features as this."
2,loss of the family farm brings grief and hope,"My biggest disappointment with this book was when I turned the page and discovered it was the LAST page. I really wanted the story to continue. Anyone who has ever lived on a farm, or known anyone who has, will identify with the grief that attends the loss of family land and the life of farmer and farmer's wife. Rita, Mack, and Jodi, the adults, are well drawn, but the teens, Kenzie and Young Taylor, are spot on. Young Taylor, in all his goth finery and make-up, is vulnerable and yet wise. Kenzie, drawn to religion with an almost cultish passion, teeters on the brink of disaster. I held my breath as I read her story. Although dealing with loss, depression, betrayal and grief, the story of this farm family - no longer farmers - resonates with hope."
2,always on my mind,I read this because my son was reading it in school.Little did i know that I would think about it so often.the tragedy of it all is unbearable.
2,"""THE BEST OF"" NOW ""THE REST OF"" LATER","""The Best Of The New Scooby Doo Movies"" is an excellent collection. A must have for any Scooby fan. Warner Bros. has done a nice job putting this together. This is what the studio considers to be the best in this series. We can only hope that they will soon release ""The Rest Of The New Scooby Doo Movies"". If you enjoyed the first and Second Seasons of ""Scooby Doo Where Are You"", Dont pass this one up, you will not be disapointed."
2,LIL DERRICK AND DEM SMOKED OUTT BOYS!!,THIS CD IZ FIYA!!CHECK OUT HOW BABY NEPHEW AND THEM DO THEY THANG ON HERE.IT ALSO GOT YOUNG BUCK (G-UNIT) FEATURED ON THA ALBUMCHECK IT OUT!!GANGSTA TRACKS!!R.I.P. LIL DERRICK
2,Not quite as tasty as the rest of the line,"These bars have the perfect mix of carbs and protein that I look for in a meal replacement bar, but unlike the rest of the bars in this line I found the taste and consistency a little off for my tastes. Still a great meal replacement bar for the cost."
2,Great Kit!,This xacto kit is great! I bought it to cut some high impact polystyrene. This product shipped to me in San Francisco in two days! Really fast ship. I am very happy.
2,Angels Among Us by Alabama,I love Alabama and this song is absolutely awesome. I get good service from Amoizon. They deliver in a timely fashion. Jo Quamme
2,High quality value priced Inkjet Paper,I have used this paper since I found it a couple a years ago for my all purpose paper. It is a 24 lb. 97 brightness high quality paper in a full ream of 500 sheets. It feeds great in my Canon printer and the HP I used to have. The print quality is great and the price is even better. I have looked everywhere and have never found a better deal than this.AMD Phenom II X4 955 Black Edition Deneb 3.2 GHz 4x512 KB L2 Cache Socket AM3 125W Quad-Core Processor - Retail HDZ955WFGBMBOX
2,Great for Reusable Grocery Bags at the Store Too,I have one on my stroller and use the other on my grocery cart to hold my reusable grocery bags. I had been looking for a product to do this for some time and this fits perfectly.
2,WORST COLLECTION EVER...,"This is the greatest collection ever!Everything is so funny,and they have a rat.True,pure classics.They are unlike the junk in other strips like 'Family Circus','Rose is Rose','Dr. Drake',and 'Marmaduke'.This almost matches the cuteness of bats."
2,"compelling story, appalling grammar/punctuation","The story and atmosphere of the book are compelling. The production values, however, are appalling and distracting. Was there no editor available who knows English? If they manage to do a second printing, for the sake of future readers, I hope they can afford to properly edit the text.Even with the obvious mistakes, the story itself makes reading the book worthwhile."
2,Love this book,"I already have the paperback, but needed to download to my Kindle, so I always have it at my finger tips!"
2,Grindin',"...I do like the music in this video, because it's upbeat and goes along with the moves. The stretching in the begining and end is great. In this viedo they show you a dance move and then break it down and then do it at tempo. It took me a lot of rewinding to get the fun moves down. But once you know the whole routine and moves you can do it at clubs and parties. I didn't sweat a whole lot during this workout, probably becasue of all the breaking the move down."
2,one heck of an overview... with much detailed information,"this book, is all about the facts... and it tells them in a story-book fashion... plenty of photographs and illustrations... not just summaries on the famous gunfighters, but page after page on each one... huge index, with just about every gunfighter you've ever heard of, and many that you haven't...If I was writing this review back in the 50's when the book was first published, I would have to give it a 5-star rating... but since it is 2005, taken the amount of resources now available though the internet, printing & photocopy technology, and the ease of travel; modern day author's could (but haven't) have done a little better job putting such a complete reference book together. This is still a top-notch book, even in the new millenium"
2,An excellent read,This is great for children with fantastic artwork and good details! Kids will love this book!
2,This CD is AWESOME!!!,"It's a must have! GB5 sounds sooo awesome and so does Alessa, Liliana, and Natalie. Great job guys!Here's their website: www.gb5online.com"
2,The best book of its kind!,"This is the definitive manual on marketing schools and colleges. In addition to containing tons of helpful stategies, the most important part of the book is that it articulates what marketing really is. It's not ""sales,"" it's not ""promotion,"" it's a two-way street that forces the institution to be flexible and adapt to the market. If you are charged with marketing an educational institution, you need to read this book. Most importantly, you need to make sure the people who are the obstacles in a successful marketing plan's path (and they exist in every school and college) read it as well. The only bad thing about this book is that it's out of print. If you can find one - BUY IT!!! Better yet, petition the publisher to bring out another edition."
2,my flatware,"I love this flatware. I have to agree with others who have bought it, however in one respect: the knife blades tend to pit easily. I simply wash those by hand. It's a nice weight and very goodlooking."
2,I couldn't get my eyes off of this blood thirsty book!!!!!,"This book is amazing!! Just like the first one..VAMPIRE KISSES. You read one page and you get hooked and you can't stop reading it. I like that this book has romance. Everyone loves a vampire and mortal romance, right? I would definately say that you should read VAMPIRE KISSES first. But other than that... this is definately a book for those gothic chicks out there who knows how it is to be the outsider in there town....i know, cuz im one of 'em."
2,A Great Look into a Unique World,"Phil Bossert offers a detailed look into the difficult but rewarding life of Air Force Academy Cadets. He's chosen to concentrate on one very unique aspect of USAFA, the Cadet Honor Code. Few college students live under such a exacting standard to neither lie, cheat, or steal nor tolerate those who do. His characters must resolve some very difficult issues and the reader is rewarded with a very good story line. This is a worthy effort from a first time published author. As an Academy graduate, I can highly recommend ""Core Values""."
2,I rarely give 5's,"'Heaven' reminds me of the best parts of 'The Cook The Thief His Wife and Her Lover' combined with the cinematography of anything out of the best of Antonioni...add to the mix a narrative as creative and compelling as 'Memento' and this is a 4 1/2 star film...by my rating a 5 is a film for all time (e.g. Cassablanca) 'Heaven' may well hold up in time; but, it is at least as good as anything in the last 10 years."
2,Great interactive Toy,This toy was easy to use and explain to others how to use. I used this for interaction during a customer appreciation day and was a BIG hit. Lots of fun for customes to try and use.
2,A decent cd from a guitar legend,"I love Ernie Isley. He's one of the reasons I play guitar today. Overall, I wanted more of that ernie that rips ""climbin up the ladder"" or ""hope you feel better love."" I got that from ""Rising from the ashes"" which for me, is the standout ""guitar"" cut on the cd. Originally, I gave this cd a ""3 star"" rating. that could have more to do with the fact that ""I"" wanted more wicked guitar work. Don't get me wrong, the guitar work is there, just not how I expected! Ernie Isley is a class musician and he ""handles"" it on several cuts off this cd. If you are looking to be mesmerized by his chops, get ready for a ""few"" cuts, but that is all. However, he's right in the R&B thing, which is cool. I've changed my scoring or rating to a 4 out of 5. The more I listen, the more I like. Fair weather friend stands out along with Song for the Muses. Ernie is the man. Always has been, always will be!"
2,A Moving Book,"I used this book for a book club that I lead at the community college where I work. We had a student who led the discussion that had traveled to the Peace Memorial in Nagasaki, and this book was an excellent catalyst for discussion about war and nuclear weapons. The survivor stories are each moving in their own way and show the effects of war, propaganda, prejudice, and the frightening effects of allowing ourselves to have a""faceless enemy."" Easy to read for busy people because each story is only three to four pages long."
2,REVIEW ON FAMILY MEMBER WITH CANCER,"One True ThingTHIS IS A MOVIE ABOUT THE VERY REAL ANGER IN A FAMILY TRYING TO COPE WITH THE CANCER THAT A MOTHER HAS BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH. SAD, BUT VERY POINENT , A VERY TRUE AND HEARTBREAKING STORY THAT A LOT OF FAMALIES GO THRU ."
2,Good first novel,I loved this novel and am now hooked on reading the entire series. There were some loose ends left hanging that definitely made me want to read more. Historical fiction is my favorite reading genre and this one fits the bill.
2,"A very good anthology , for the AVERAGE fan !!!!!!","I have to start by saying, I HATE hits or anthology CDs...There is always a great song or two missing.This 2 CD set is no exception.Where the hell is A WORLD OF FANTASY? This is huge when you talk TRIUMPH! I bought this set for the better sound quality, the older cds suck.(MASTERING) The TRIUMPH library was REMASTERED in 2004! The quality is even better than this set! As good as the latest Judas Priest,Queensryche,Ozzy-1995,I have the 2004 Never Surrender.I give this set 4 stars, not because A world of Fantasy is missing. But because there is no 5 star hits collection! If you want 5 star TRIUMPH buy their albams,they are well worth it!!!!"
2,EEK! A mouse!,"Our three year old had been asking for a ""little baby mouse"" for Christmas. Not being a fan of the real thing, we saw this Folkmanis Mini Field mouse and knew it would be perfect! This little guy is very realistic looking and cute as can be. And, just to be safe, our three year old keeps him in a ""cage"" at night!"
2,Enjoy it every time I use it,"Easy to use, easy to clean. I do jobs that I would otherwise avoid because it is so EASY. Find it sturdy, reliable, not too heavy. No mess when you use the mixing cylinder. Great for a person living alone. Beating eggs, whipping cream, frothing milk very easy. Takes up very little space."
2,I feel competent!,"I have purchased, borrowed, and rented several exercise DVDs since I decided to take better care of myself. To give you a better picture, I am... well, honestly 38, but I prefer to admit to 35 years old, and no longer overweight. Don't tell anyone, but I have gone from a size -- to a size 3. I own, and enjoy Kathy Smith's yoga, but do not feel that it provides enough of a cardio workout. I borrowed a Denise Austin DVD, and that woman makes me feel like a pathetic loser. So, I decided to give Sweatin' to the Oldies a try. I love it! When most people on the video are stepping, I am able to ""run,"" making me feel like, ""Hey! I'm a Rockstar!"" When I tire, I can slow down, but still keep up with the exercises. I would definitely recommend this DVD series to anyone just beginning, but also to those who feel like an uncoordinated sack when trying to workout alongside many other fitness gurus."
2,"Disappointed initially, then pleased",The Exergen Temporal thermometer we received did not work. It was not operator error (which is what I initially thought) and had to be replaced. The second product works great! We were just disappointed when the first one did not function.
2,the best of her,"This album has excellent songs! Walk away, infatuation, i'm ok and beautiful, it has very deep letters, but she shouts too much, abuses her voice, in ocaciones tires"
2,Anatomy,Stan Ridgway's new album continues his string of wonderful songs with lyrics that help you escape from everyday life. THis album would make an excellent purchase for any true music lover.
2,This Book Was Great,"I don't know what you guys are talking about I thought this book was great just like the others. Oh and it did say why Jen and Sam were there, you just must have been reading to fast."
2,Very hard.,So far it seems to be just as described. It has not worn at all and even though I was worried it may be brittle dropping it has not resulted in anything negative.
2,good,hardto find in the stores- and the product was what they said and arrived in good time and in good shape
2,Clearblue easy fertility monitor,"I have been using the monitor for 2 cycles now. So far, it has been helpful in determining my 'high' and 'peak' fertile days, so there is less guessing involved and I have some peace of mind that I am timing inseminations appropriately. The only drawback is that I have longer cycles, and do not tend to ovulate until at least day 20, so I have been using 20 test sticks per cycle, which gets expensive because each box is over $30 and contains 30 sticks. I have only given it a 4 and not a 5 for the rating because of the cost. It has been easy to use, but read all the directions carefully."
2,This album rocks!!,"Sarah McLachlan is pure genius. The lyrics are the FARTHEST you'll get from the word ""superficial""; they'll keep you wondering for hours...the melody haunting. The perfect music to cry to, relax to, or just listen to. Every aspect of this album gives a new perspective on life so different, yet so true...it's scary. So do yourself a big favor and BUY THIS CD, which is something I should do since I've literally worn-out mine!"
2,So relieved to find this stroller,"I finally broke down and bought a triple stroller. I have 2 year old twins and a 3 month old. I am pleased to say I do love the stroller. It makes it much easier for me to go places. It is quite big, but is pushes and turns really well. I think the second seat is a little tight to get feet in, but it is no big deal. I would recommend this stroller for people that have 3 kids in a stroller. The price is very good for the quality. It is easy to fold and unfold. It was easy for me to put together by myself. And I can't assemble a sandwich.I have also put a infant car seat in the last seat and it fits snug and comfortable. I don't think it's ""made"" for it, but I feel confident that it is safe."
2,Truly a space saver,"This is great highchair if you're short on space. It takes up much less room than the typical highchair. I like the that the chair can be moved in 3 different settings and that once my baby is old enough I can use it as a booster seat as well, 2 for the price of one. It also cleans up easily. My only dislike is that the tray does not click into place easily. I always have to mess with it for a while before it will lock onto the arms of the chair."
2,nutritious & filling for my child,"My child has been a lover of Chicken Pot Pie soup since she was 2 years old. She's probably had 3 cans per week over the last 4 years. A full can is just the right serving size for her and it has a nice variety of vegetables. Unfortunately she's not fond of chicken in general, so I give it to her minus the chicken. I'm disappointed that I can't find it in local stores anymore."
2,Fits my needs,This product fits my needs perfectly. Large enough to fit my hands comfortably and well made. The only quibble would in the area of programming some of the functions.
2,Cured My 20+ Year Stiff Neck,"By placing one ball under my neck and rolling my neck around for a few minutes, I am able to turn my neck while driving without feeling the usual stiffness and pain. In fact, I can roll my head in almost any direction without neck pain for the first time in at least 20 years. To work the sides of my neck, I placed one ball on a tailor's ham (used in sewing) so that my shoulder would have room while laying on my side with the ball fully supporting the side of my neck. After 15 minutes of gentle rolling my neck on each side, I have no side neck pain for the first time in decades. I can't recommend this product enough."
2,A taste of what to come....,"I listened to this album 2 times in a row just so I could wrap my head around it. ""Hunky Dory"" works almost like a preview or prequel to ""Ziggy Stardust"" in that it's lyrical abstractness and it's willingness to explore uncharted musical territory is incredibly similar. Which is a good thing because I can't think of one bad song on this album, maybe one had a minor flaw but this is just about as good as it gets.If you're looking to get a David Bowie album that won't disappoint you, this is definitely one you could choose.If you're wondering what album of his to get first to test the waters, I'd say ""Ziggy"" or ""Heroes"".This album is definitely a classic."
2,Wonderful Holiday Movie,"This movie is a classic to watch every Christmas for me and my family - it has everything a person can look for in a movie. Romance, drama and comedy all wrapped up in one. The all star cast is amazing. I highly recommend watching it during the holiday season."
2,freak come out at night,"r kelly goes back to his freaky roots on this one, if you wanna hear kelly talk about oral sex for the millionith time please get this, if you love bump-n-grind, 12 play and classic kelly then this is especially for you. fellas, ladies you better protection on this."
2,"Cute, but...","I love raccoons, so I decided to add this little guy to my collection. He is OK, granted raccoons typically have more than 3 stripes on their tail. This toy is also markedly asymmetrical, one ear and eye patch is bigger than the other -__-Other than that, this toy is a soft beanie that you can either collect or play with. So..."
2,AMAZING SHOES!,"Good Morning! I bought these for my Birthday Weekend, and dancing with my friends. They worked wonderfully! They're ONLY a 4 inch heel, (surprising from Jessica Simpson), but they didn't hurt 5 hours into wearing them. I LOVE these HEELS!"
2,The enemies are human too.,"Might I say a standard ""the enemies are human too"" movie with some dabs of Japanese culture thrown in. I watched as I enjoyed the small amount of exposure to Japanese culture. Obviously, much better production values than were used in the John Wayne days.-- Louis J Sheehan"
2,Glomp!,"While the animation is sometimes sub-par, and the translation frankly amusing...Example:""I would LOVE to touch such rare treaures of intelligence!""""all right.... but...Stop looking at me like that!""^_^ But the characters are lovable and well thought, dynamic and oftentimes convulted. The plot..... WHEW. It goes forever, and is so richly detailed. Defineately one of the best for PS1. Here's hoping for a sequel!"
2,Excellent for daily clean-up/short handle so you don't have to bend,This broom is short because you are supposed to hold the handle in your hand (with your arm straight) and sweep instead of bending and sweeping into a traditional dustpan. I like it because it is not hard on your back. We've had ours for years and the dustpan finally broke off of the handle on one side and the bristles on the broom are worn & shriveled up. I am definitely purchasing another rather than a traditional broom set. We use this 3 times/day with 4 kids we need multiple clean-ups at the table!
2,Soap!,This dvd set is to complete my existing collection. It is one of the most enjoyable shows that I have ever watched! I recommend it to everyone.
2,A record? You Eediot!,"This CD features songs and instrumentals that were featured inThe Ren & Stimpy Show. The songs are not the same versions that were on the show, they are rerecordings. Unfortunately, show creator (and original voice of Ren) John Kricfalusi did not participate in the album. Multi-talented Billy West does Ren here, as well as Stimpy (who he always did). The songs arguably aren't as good as the versions on the TV show, but they are still pretty amusing. Most fans of the show will probably enjoy this CD."
2,One Hit Wonder..,"Well.. not really. The Starland Vocal Band had a couple of great hits, but the one they're most remembered for is Afternoon Delight. As a kid I remember listening to this song on the car radio. This is an awesome song by a not very memorable band.Gonna find my baby.. Gonna hold her tight.. Gonna grab some afternoon delight.."
2,"Happy with color, size, and shape.","This was just the Bible I was looking for. Fits great in my purse, I love the color and pattern on the front. Text and page quality are great."
2,GREAT SOUND!,"I love this product because it cuts out alot of the background noice. It is also great because others can't hear what your listening to either, even when it is at full blast, but believe me the sound is quality. Good buy!"
2,enore & more,"Not all new material, but with the bonus of formally unreleased material, it's a must for complete-ists. Sarah's version of ""Whistle Down The Wind"" is restrained when compared to Tina Arena's recording - very reminiscent of her performance at The Royal Albert Hall ( available on DVD/VHS ). As the recordings on this album range from 1987 - 2001 you can clearly hear how her voice has improved over time. I hesitate to think how much input Sarah had on this album - no mention of it on her website, no notes from her inside, no Frank Peterson & no producer credit. This to me explains why the album feels ""uneven"" when listening to it. ( No continuous theme that holds together her previous projects - I would advise also that La Luna is NOT a repackage of Fly as stated in another's review - both very different in feel & tone ) Former hubby Andrew Lloyd Webber may be fulfilling an old contract with Decca - but ""In The Mandarin's Orchid Garden"" is an enjoyable song & nice to have."
2,Blender,"This personal blender is very handy, not only it's a blender, but you can put the lid and take it in your car like a thermos. It's small enough where it does not take a lot of room, and it's a nice piece of machine. It blends ice real well."
2,Excellent Watch,This watch is easy to read the time and especially the date without having to scroll displays. Very comfortable too.
2,"Davis must've ""channeled"" the late, great Garland","It is without a doubt that one of the best performances by an actress portraying another actress belongs to the magnificent Judy Davis. Awards have been deservedly given to her for her wrenching and sympathetic glimpse at one of the great entertainers of the 20th century.Regardless of others' comments about the ""soap opera trimmings"" or Lorna Luft's ""recollections,"" the powerhouse acting of Davis makes up for any discrepancies.Take me ""over that rainbow"" with you, Miss Davis!"
2,Page-Turner,"If you are an E. Lynn Harris fan, you will love this book. Stewart touches many issues in this well written book, from gambling addictions, STD disease, rapes, death, homosexuality, Alzheimer's disease and more.""Episodes"" is a fast pace read. I finished it in a day. I look forward to reading the sequel ""Promise Me"".J. Keith Stewart, is definitely one of my favorite authors."
2,This product is my saviour!,"Before I bought this product I was using the aweful video capture software with the Voodoo 3 TV card. Not only does this software allow capture in MPEG1,2 and AVI but you can caputure just the sound, video, stills etc.Then I found the editing functions. It took a while to get used to the new MGI interface (the same for MGIPhotosuite) but it is very intuitive.To build a film and produce it is done with ease. You can have all the basic editing like trasnstions, captions, effects, add audio etc. This is for any would be producer but of course if you are a professional then stay clear as this is vey basic but very good! It satisfies all my needs for video capture and editng, has loads of options and is all at a good price! I just wish you could get rid of the annoying introduction at the start!"
2,So Cute!,"My daughter received this for a Christmas gift and she really enjoys playing with it. It has adorable little curtains and ""roses"" all over the outside. My only two complaints is that it isn't very tall- she is 3 1/2 and she kneels the whole time, but it is still very enjoyable. It also takes up a lot of space, even when folded inside eachother for storage. If storage space is an issue, you might consider a collapsible wire frame tent playhouse instead."
2,watercolors,We got an art set for our granddaughter and she needed paper for her watercolors. I thought this was a very good price. Thank you

2,Pleasantly Pleased,"So far, I am pleased with Meinl drum products. Great instrument, with a nice sound. I bought this drum for my son, and loves them. He says they are amazing with a nice sounding bass."
2,It's just not that easy....,"I think the author is well informed and gives great advice, but his advice is hollow sounding to those of us who have been there and done that. Admittedly, I learn towards self publishing authors who have experience rather than educational knowledge. If it's any consolation, most kids grow up into adults with children of their own. Eventually they look back and understand exactly what their alienating parent did to them. They feel cheated out of years that can't be given back. I know this is terribly hard to go through at the time, but something called ""Karma"" eventually rears its head. The author is correct about keeping a diary, thus documenting the events that are taking place. This documentation will prove invaluable the minute Karma does come around. Been there and done this, folks. I'm still alive to talk about it."
2,"Very interesting, and just overall EXCELLENT!!","Even though i stopped listening to country music about 5 years ago, i have to admit, that Garth was one artist that i could never get tired of. Now with this ""Chris Gaines"" album, it is great to experience the Rock side of Mr.Brooks. This CD is a very novel idea, and definitely a treat to listen to. It's just too bad that Garth won't stick with this new rock/pop sound, because i totally feel that GARTH BROOKS IS WAY TOO GOOD FOR COUNTRY MUSIC. Of course, the country stuff he is known for IS excellent, and that's just about the only country music i can stand. So, if you'd like to try this album, go ahead----and i'm sure you'll be glad you did."
2,An interesting human story about two activists,"The criticism that people expected more about the Hudson River and Environmentalism may be justified to some extent. But what these critics missed is that this is a story about two people's journey into the world of environmental protection and litigation. Both men influenced by their ""love"" of the Hudson River and one also by his family's legacy. There really are some shocking stories about the actions of corporations and local authorites which should concern us all no matter where we live. I enjoyed particulary seeing how Robert F Kennedy Jr has come terms with his family's legacy and carried it on in his own way. A good read if you want the human side of environmental action."
2,Great Show with a Social Message,"I wasn't born until after the show ended, but I loved watching the re-runs while I was growing up (and I still like watching them, although I have each of the seasons on DVD). The show had a very strong message about society at large, although the primary audience was African American. DYNO-MITE!!"
2,Great Ni-Mh Battery,"Makita has came of age with the NiMh batteries. NO MEMORY means they can be charged at any time reguardless of the batteries current state of charge. Run time with the NiMh battery is outstanding,lasting for several hours longer than NiCad style batteries. I have used mine in my 12V drill literally for days with excellent output. You'll need one of the Makita chargers(""usually BUT NOT ALWAYS"" supplied with new cordless tools) that is designed to charge NiMh batteries. All in all I'd rate this battery 5 stars. You'll be well pleased if you upgrade to the NiMh batteries for your cordless tool power needs!!!"
2,It was great when it all began...,"This version ia great! A little different from the Picture Show but they belt-out the tunes like they're on stage, just what I love! Tim Curry is still a god amongst mere mortals, let us all give thanks to Richard O'Brien. Amen.It was great when it all began, I was a regular Rocky Horror fan, it was over when he had the plan, to start a working on a new type of Transvestite clan (A picture show!), now the only thing that give me hope, Is shouting vulgarities at a screen & smokin' dope, Rose tints my world, keeps me safe from my trouble & pain..."
2,Great book!,"I thought this book was complete - it was detailed/lengthy, but I think it dealt with resolving conflict in a more realistic way than most novels - yet still give you the happily ever after that most romance readers like. I loved the character - they were imperfect, yet strong. The made mistakes, learned, grew - became better. I think it could have been a little hotter - not more sex - more tensions but it was a good read and I'd recommend it - most definitely"
2,Right On Target,"The correlation between sports and business has always been intriguing to me. I've just been waiting for someone to develop a valid process and quantify the results so I can apply it. Nice work, Good read. The underlying hockey story is compelling."
2,Timeless Sound,"As an oldster, I got burnt out with the sound of the 90's. This group has a fresh sound, and John Ondrasik has found his place in heaven! I hope they keep it up for many more decades!They are on my list of greats for the 2000's!"
2,Fresh Prince and Jazzy Jeff are hip hop's Dynamic Duo,"I still remember hearing this on the local pop station when I came out in April 1988. I was turning 15, and that one song ""Parents Just Don't Understand"" still sticks out in my mind as the best song of 1988."
2,High Quality Sheets,"These sheets are very good quality with nice stitching, hefty fabric, yet soft to touch. Long top sheet that stays put under bottom of mattress. The amazing fitted sheet has a panel of heavy duty stretchy knit fabric sewed at each end that hugs the corners beautifully. A great buy! Wish I had ordered two for our new pillow top mattress."
2,Beautiful photos,"This book has beautiful photos and describes some tips on what to strive for in various dressage exercises. As a beginner, I am still somewhat in the dark about how to achieve such perfection since the book is not heavy on details of how to use your aids to achieve good results. I am now looking for a book that can be a good supplement to my instructors."
2,Excellent,I was very impressed witht the promptness of this products delivery and the quality of the product. I never have trouble getting a connection to the internet thanks to this router and love the modern white color. The price was excellent as well. Thanks
2,I cried,"Never in my life have I ever read a book so moving. I never wanted to put this book down I Love it that much! I went skiing and brought the book along with me--After about 2o minutes I was ready to stop skiing and start reading again. This is a truley amazing book, I have never been so moved and touched by a novel. Lee did a spectaculor job in allowing us to see the real Lucy, I even cried in the last two ""episodes"" or chapters. Bravo Lee---Write more on Lucy, I Love Your Work!"
2,Nice CD - Great listening - what more do we want?,"I first of Tim Flannery when living in Sand diagoe inthe 1980s. He played second base for the Sand Diego Padres. Then I heard his music on the onlince verions Jimmy Buffett's Radio Margaretiville. Bought it, loved, play it all the time. ""baseball song"" is excellent, yet the theme of the CD goes well beyond baseball."
2,Phyllis,"The mother reminds me of myself and my mother. I'm not tech-savy and I keep a lot in the freezer. Easy to follow, very funny and relatable."
2,Does the Job,"I bought this printer to use during a sixth grade graduation party so we could give the kids pictures of themselves with their friends. Overall, I was very happy with the printer. It's lightweight, quick and easy to set up and produces crisp color images. But I am disappointed that it takes about 50 seconds to print one 4 X 6 print and not ""up to 39 seconds"" as the product description states. During the party, waiting for the prints was a little frustrating, since there was a long line of kids. At home, it's no big deal and my kids enjoy printing their own photos. Good portable printer for the money ($100)."
2,Very good little camera,"I am very pleased with this camera. Compact, powerful, large LCD, intuitive interface. Images are very clear... my only criticism is that the on/off button occasionally gets turned on by accident."
2,ANOTHER EXCELLENT RELEASE FROM THE GROOVEYARD,"AL ESTRADA is another excellent guitarist that has found a home on the GROOVEYARD label. Most GROOVEYARD releases in my collection ( about 40 ) are a fabulous journey of discovery for guitar nuts. While most of the artists on the GROOVEYARD are not well known, this label offers some of the best new guitar musik out there. If you want to hear the future of the guitar, check out their catalogue.AL ESTRADA offers a lot of different vibes and has the virtuosity to make them his own. Great player / great compositions and ESTRADA plays all instruments ( except bass on 2 tracks ). A great emerging talent.If you are a fan of SATRIANI's / VINNIE MOORE's or STEVE MORSE, this should put smile on your face."
2,Heart Stopper!,Saw this on PBS in advance airing --- can't wait to get it to watch over and over. A great mix of traditional Celtic music and more modern. The 'boys' are worth watching !!!!
2,Laugh and Learn,"A comic novel-archaeology text book. This is even better than Death By Theory, his first book that we read semester at UCB. Its funnier and has many more of his strange illustrations.The subject is archeological field methods and it's set on a historic period site in New Zealand thats staffed by a bunch of weird and wild characters. I'm guessing that its the only archeology methods book that has a Yiddish glossary. Would make a good intro archaeology text."
2,Broken,"Cynthia Clawson is such a powerful singer. In this album, the audience needs to clear the room of auditory clutter and sit back to listen to the words of the song. Powerful words. Words of comfort, healing and love to the broken hearted. Hope. It all flows into the heart from Cynthia's own emotional delivery. Better than therapy."
2,the real thing,"i was a bill withers fan back from the late 70's (ok i'm dating myself) i was introduced to him when 'just the 2 of us' came out. i loved his voice so much i combed the resale shops and found the original recording of 'lean on me' in vinyl. 'grandma's hands' was one of my favorite recordings. bill withers is one of those singers who sounds as good a cappella as he does w/ grover washington jr. (the only person i think who can come close is josh white jr. - check out his album 'i can sing a rainbow') i always loved the smooth whiskey sound of his voice evident in 'lean on me', 'just the two of us', 'grandma's hands' and 'lovely day' i haven't seen the GAP commercial and really don't care to. i just will crank up my stereo and get the real thing"
2,Hummingbird becoming extinct!,"As with the other reviewers, this is a wonderful product The sad new is this product being discontinued by the current manufacturer. As times goes by, it will be harder and harder to find the refills. My Hummingbird is now 4 yrs old, and is still going strong. So I will be in the gathering of all of us Hummingbird afficianadoes who will experience remorse for its demise."
2,"Fine, memorable film","Mike Nichols continues to astound with his risk-taking projects and his creative achievement. He and the team he has assembled, from cast to crew (and certainly Tony Kushner, whose play is the bedrock of this film), have raised the bar for a ""television movie"". A moving, transcendent experience.To the previous reviewer from Santa Fe who yearns for a film to stand on its own 'pitard' (sic): one assumes you meant 'petard', as in 'hoisted on his own petard', etc. However, a petard is a bomb, an actual explosive device. Interestingly, the word comes from a French word meaning ""to break wind."" Not sure you meant to say you look for the day when a film will stand on its own bomb. Or the gaseous alternative."
2,good,"This book is an excellent resource for the graduate student in physics. It covers many of the advanced topics like path integrals, etc. In the downside, it barely skims over some of the most important topics like the hydrogen atom."
2,crossroads of twilight,This is one of the best installment in robert jordans series. The prot becomes intricate and more interesting as the series draws closer towards tai'mon Gaidon in which rand al'thor has to fight the dark one in order to save the world. Any who think this a slow book must be pretty boring people who are very hard to please!
2,Very Powerful Presentation by an experienced wall street options expert,This has been most helpful of the option videos I've seen since I was looking to learn specifically about spreads. It changed my whole way of thinking about options and now I am making much safer trades with a higher probability of success unlike before watching this one.
2,Better than I thought,"Even if you do not like the Doors very much, this is kind of a well-done documentary on a historically important band. I mainly though they were a bunch of hippies (which they are if you consider this DVD) but overall here the format chosen makes one forget that and does carry over some of the excitement they seemed to generate at oen time. While certainly they are in some ways over-rated as a band, they had some interesting sides, mainly in thier somewhat over-exposed frontman. The comments by Johnny Depp are quite nice and sober."
2,Great for Beginners,My kids ages 6 & 4 are always pulling this book out. They love to draw and this book gives them help where needed.
2,Reality,"This movie portrays the ""real"" life situations of self-seeking self-autonomous relationships that spiral uncontrollably towards divorce when married couples seek to control the relationship or change their spouse. While some of the references to sex seemed to be added for shock effect, the reality is that without some sense of ""us"" guiding a relationship the reality is the meaningless and vanity that the husband and wife experience in most of this movie.Some cheesy scenes and: (1) Who sends their kids to camp all summer and (2) Who believes their kids are oblivious to their parents marital problems?In the end, though, the recognition of communal fellowship grounded in the other brings hope to the tyrannical, self-consuming, and chaotic relationship which is symptomatic of current American society."
2,Excelente tarjeta,Excelente la respuesta en lectura y escritura de esta tarjeta. Funciona perfectamente bien con mi Nikon D60
2,perfect gift for a grandpa to be,"This book is absolutely adorable. While it was written from the perspective of a dad to his pregnant (with girl) daughter, the sentiments are truly lovely."
2,Wonderful collection,"Every story in this collection gives one much to think about or laugh about. Clever writing that catches one by surprise---such as ""Sooper Tendent"" for caliph's helper. The poetry is original and fits it's situation perfectly. I am glad to have the collection on my Kindle and will NOT be sending it to the archieve so that I can revisit parts many times."
2,John Prine - Fair & Square,I absolutely love this - I've been a Prine fan since his first (self titled) album and this ranks up there among my favorites! IT'S JUST HARD TO BEAT A GOOD JOHN PRINE ALBUM (CD)!!
2,Great rake for hair mats in Labradoodle,This rake worked great in getting out the many fur mats in our Labradoodle.Would recommend it.
2,"Beyond worthiness, and into respectibility? Say it ain't so!","This album is a lot more honest (and a lot more fun) than 'Psycho Circus' for a number of different reasons. The production is minimal, the songs hold up much better, and the attitude of the band is positive. At this point the reunion tour was not yet a reality, but here we have a bunch of guys who pretty much wanted to just play some music and get their point across, which (for the most part) they did. The only reason I fail to give it a 5-star recommendation is for the excess of ballads. ""I Still Love You"" could have been left off; ditto ""Beth"" (sorry, PC fans--they could have done ""Hard Luck Woman"" instead). But the requisite makeup-era tunes are the ones that hold up the best, especially ""See You Tonight"": Gene's nod to early ""Yes it Is"" Beatles material. Good stuff."
2,I love this coring set!,The corer is wonderful. It takes some pressure from the user to work (obviously) but it cuts the apple into perfect sections and the corer itself cleans up very easily. We are very happy with our purchase.
2,An Amazing Show,Everytime I watch this show I laugh and cry - it shows you what life is really like - funny and challenging at same time - just awesome. And - the acting is top notch
2,This is one of the best !,"Out of all the various US made/produced DVDs, this DVD has the best video transfer. Besides the video/audio quality, the animation is great. The story resembles that of Lupin the 3rd. The anime has good story lines, great characters, humor, action, mecha...but most of all, this show has style...which is further reinforced by the jazz/blues soundtrack. If you are not into giant robots and pokemon, this is the one for you. It's very, very enjoyable."
2,I am Jack's review of this book,"I had read a lot of Palahniuk's work prior to reading Fight Club, which I would imagine is rare, as most people familiarize themselves with him after having seen the movie that is based on this book. I still think it's his best book to date.It is much easier in the book to foresee the 'trick' ending, I think."
2,My favorite KV video!,"This is my fourth and favorite KV video! Both the AM and PM workouts are wonderful! The AM workout is ultra energizing and leaves you feeling refreshed and ready for the day. The reps are tough but Karen really inspires you to keep going and to feel the burn! The PM video is really my favorite. I sit all day at the office and this video has some truly wonderful stretches that leave my aching body feeling relaxed as well as strong! I recommed this video for anyone - probably intermediate level and above - who needs something quick and effective in the morning and something effective yet relaxing in the evening. I also liked the PM yoga moves a lot more than the straight up yoga videos (I don't have enough balance for those). The PM yoga stretches are a nice intro to yoga, so you might also consider this video, if you are thinking about trying yoga."
2,Great tool,"I was torn between the Jet and this unit - especially after reading the reviews about the Delta unit getting broken in transit on more than one occasion. I figured that everyone seemed happy IF it arrived in one piece, so I took a chance. Happily, mine came in unscathed. Set up was quick and easy and in no time, I had made my first mortise with it. I have yet to really put it through its paces, but so far, I love it."
2,What a treat,"I was skeptical, but trusted the reviews. An amazing technology. The network connection was flawless - worked the first time (XP)All functions work - the scanner is slow, but does a nice job. The OCR software is weak - have switched to Omnipage Pro and no problems.Copy and print are excellent.Highly recommend the Brother."
2,EE,Great book teaches the abc's of spreading the word Great history of where the beginnings of sharing the word and how you can go and share without fear and with confidence
2,Essential!,"I bought this to replace the one I lost. I use it all the time on my 2.5 quart & 4 quart pots. It's great for expanding the possibilities of your pressure cooker pots. And, it's essential for the egg poacher accessory so that you can see when your eggs are done. Also, it's great for boiling pasta so that you know when it's about to boil over. As for the quality of the lid, it's top notch and not too light. Highly recommended product."
2,An anthology of writings by Native American women,"Composed and compiled by author, activist and former principal chief of the Cherokee Nation Wilma Mankiller, Every Day Is A Good Day is an anthology of writings by Native American women reflecting on such varied topics as day-to-day life, love and acceptance, governmental issues, ceremony, finding one's way through difficult times, and much more. Black-and-white photographs of the contributors are included, but the primary focus of Every Day Is A Good Day is the power of the multitude of voices, most of which are from different tribes, and each one's message to all readers. A welcome amalgamation of wisdom, warnings, and dry commentary."
2,works!,"I have been taking these for 6 months- I don't love taking 6 tabs a day, but they seem to work best when you do. The price is better then some of the other products on the market also."
2,mark paul gosselaar the world loves you,"wow wow wow mark paul gosselaar is an explosive actor. he can do any genre comedy, suspense, romantic oh and did i mention comedy. this film is amazingly funny. the acting skills from mark paul are second to nonedont rent this film buy is its a masterpiecelee frayling hereford hr7 4js england"
2,Superb Air Cleaner,"This is being used in a small room (120 sq feet), but it clearly could accommodate a much larger room. It is quiet and efficient. Amazon shipped this very, very quickly, and the price is extraordinary -- less than it would cost to buy the HEPA filter alone elsewhere."
2,Tired of the talk,"I've been ""walking"" to this video for several weeks now. I love the exercise. It is just the right level to challenge me and hopefully help me get to a more advanced level. But there is one thing I absolutely HATE about the video. There is far too much inane and ridiculous talk. It is unfortunate that this was produced without much forethought or planning. That is obvious with all the fumbling around for the right words at the right time. The routine is fine, the music is fin. I want a version without all the talk!! The music isn't loud enough, especially on mile 3. Now that I have the routine down pat I just want the music and a countdown at each change. Enough already!!! It was tiresome the first 25 times. Now it is driving me crazy!! If I could find out what the songs are I'd dub the music over all the talk and make the video less distracting. I'll keep doing the walk routine daily, but something's gotta give!!!!"
2,Navy Blue shoes.,"These are a super nice pair of sporty navy blue shoes. Navy is ""in"" and Bruno Magli is the best Italian shoes's manufacturer."
2,Alot of pretty good recipes,I have used quite a few recipes in this book and I have been pleased with alot of them. I would recommend this book.
2,Omni-Bounce diffuser,I have only used this diffuser a cople of times but the price was right and it seems to do a very good job of lessing red eye and cutting glare from windows and mirrors.I am very happy with the product.
2,Just Above My Head,"The people of Just Above My Head-- all of them, not just Julia, or Hall, or Arthur-- but the ""little"" characters too, all live truly as one reads. I've lost track of how many times I've read the book in its entirety, much less in bits and pieces, but every time I go down into it these characters overwhelm me. I can smell them, feel their heat. Absolutely one of my favorite books of all time."
2,Great quick vaccum for hard surfaces,"We use this on our vinyl flooring and a short pile rug. Picks up a lot of dirt and dust, does well with pet and people hair, and today it picked up a chilli powder mess quickly. Not very loud either. Only problem I have is reinserting the filter after emptying because it's a little tricky to get it in just right without the rubber outer edge sticking out too much. Actually fun to use!!"
2,The Royal Jewels worth it,Even though I was familiar with many of the history of the gems and crowns it was worth seeing them in HD up close. The sharpness of the pieces is stunning. Its almost like seeing them up close and in person.For those not familiar with the stories or history of the Monarchy this is an informative and light account of the jewels and their origins.I loved the historical footage Of Queen Alexandra and Queen Mary as well as learning about the jewelry gifted to Diana for her wedding.This was well worth the price.
2,Very Inspiring,"The world is a better place because of the dedication of these Nuns. The film really conveys the ultimate reason for their Buddhist Practice. Their faces, the scenery and the music is compelling and inspiring."
2,Brilliant Analysis of What the Good Life Really Is,"Colson is a smart man with a deep knowledge of history and philosophy and a fascinating life who shares in a very readable and engaging way what he's learned about finding true happiness, contentment, joy, and fulfillment in life. His use of true stories to illustrate concepts is entertaining, and I found myself highlighting passages every few pages. I'm about to reach the end and have already decided to reread it because it's so packed with great wisdom that I want to try to absorb more of it. I HIGHLY recommend this book to everyone. It indirectly makes a case for Biblical Christianity, but at the same time, it provides a very fair and intelligent representation of the secular world view. Loved this book!"
2,A great shower radio,"I agree that this is the best shower radio. I have been through (3) other radios, all bad. This unit is true 100% digitial, great reception, good sound quality, and easy to use."
2,TOUCHES THE HEART,"This is a lovely story about two aging sisters. Both Judi Dench and Maggie Smith are magnificent in their roles. I loved the movie and wish more movies were made with interesting story content instead of the slam, bam, thank you ma'am action (I use the term loosely) movies that usually dominate the market. You will love this movie if you appreciate what happens to people in different stages of their lives. This is a wonderful movie!"
2,Great shoes,"I have used these shoes for years. The one complaint I have about them is that, as is the problem with all dog shoes that I have used, they tend to turn around no matter how tight I fasten them."
2,Snakes Alive!,Great book for those doing a lot of hiking or walking. Easy to identify pictures allow close comparison. I commonly run into snakes during rugged terrain hikes and am familiar with most but this book helped me with those where I was unsure-non poisonous.
2,Dog Loves It!,"Great product! My 80+ lb GSD took to it instantly. Seems very comfortable for her and she gets excited to put it on. Adjusts well and is the right size for her (I got the Medium size - Large wll be for x-large dogs, 100 or more lbs).Definitely recommended!"
2,delightful description of chicago blues world,"Grazian's account is an ethnographic analysis of the world of Chicago blues and how connoisseurs, tourists, artists, and business persons are part of the process of defining what it means to play authentic blues. This work, which is on the more academic side, is particularly useful for two types of readers. The first would obviously be anyone interested in the social context of the production of music more generally and the blues in particular. But this is also an insightful work of cultural sociology in the heritage of Becker's _Art Worlds_. Grazian helps uncover the complex socio-cultural context of various consumers and producers of culture and the process by which art is variously assessed for its authenticity by the communities for whom and by whom it is created."
2,!,"Why is this book not more well known? Why is the 3rd side of the story not told? Well, now it is. Seeing the brethren's faith during persecution, suffering, misunderstanding, and trials is truly an inspiration to love our Lord much more. beautiful, worth the price"
2,FOREVER?? RIGHT........,"Well, when katherine saw Michel in the New Year party she didn't even LIKE him! I hope this is the right book because I've read so much of Judy's book but like right after the summer their love was blown AWAY! so um.forever???? Yeah Right! katherine totally broke Michel's heart but I LIKED the book I mean REALLy likeed it because it tells u that doing something that you've never done isn't soooo bad! But Judy.what about a BETTER ending instead of Michel's heart all miserable??!!!"
2,"Its ""Shakespeare for the Common Reader""","If you enjoy reading Shakespeare's plays, this is a great companion volume. I read a play, and then read the relevant chapter in Bloom's book. The exercise made me think about Shakespeare's text and characters in ways I may otherwise never have done. Needless to say, this adds to one's appreciation of the Bard's works. Bloom's adoration of G. K. Chesterton is a good thing, but he cannot write Chestertonian prose, and fails when he tries. The chapters on Hamlet and the Henry IV plays are (paradoxically) the least satisfying because the author's obsession with Hamlet and Falstaff leaves little space for a serious discussion of many of the other characters.A revised, second edition would be welcome."
2,"astonishing ""juggling"" artist","This is the PBS special which introduced the unique art of Michael Moschen to a wide audience. Since it was issued, Moschen has won a MacArthur Fellowship (""genius grant""). It's a pity that this video isn't available on DVD. It shows how Moschen has elevated juggling, mixed with strong elements of dance, to an impressive art form."
2,Get into your own head.,"Every person with a career should read this book. With simplegraphs and clinical psychology in layman terms, Wareham givesyou the tools to understand why you are where you are. Morethan that, you will understand your hidden limits. As aheadhunter, this book must be read by every person whoregularly interviews others."
2,Just beautiful!,"This Blu-ray edition is so much better than the Special Edition. The colors are vibrant and the images are sharp. I have seen this miniseries several times but it was a great pleasure to watch it again in this edition. The bonus features are also more up-to-date.This adaptation of Pride and Prejudice is excellent. Although I have liked other adaptations of the novel for what they were, this is the definitive one, so far. The script follows the book fairly well and actually inspires you to reread the novel.The two leads are incomparable. Most of the supporting actors excel in their portrayals of the characters. It is a joy to watch, over and over."
2,Get this now!,"I can't believe that it took me this long to pick this album up. I was always not certain if I wanted to get this, but when I finally did I was not disappointed. This is a great album all the way through. Fast, dark, heavy and all out evil. If you want a return to real metal then pick this one up. These guys know how to make a sonic wall of sound. Get this one today."
2,What a fun game! It's really more of a toy than a game.,"My family is having a blast with this. It's so easy to use, yet has so much depth. Ever want to create your own animal? How about five legs instead of four? Yes, they did a great job. We've got years and years of fun ahead of us with this one.(Don't pay attention to those reviews by people who haven't even played it.)"
2,Great little add-on for Sony Ericsson phones,"Although you will need to provide your own power and usb cable, this is still a great accessory. It will simultaneously charge your phone with the AC while connected to your computer. Or you can elect to not connect to your computer and use the additional side port to connect to headphones or speakers. This feature is not mentioned in the specs. Also, when power is connected to the base, a bright green light stays on making it easier to see in the dark - and it just looks cool, too! They probably should have included this in the box, but since they at least do send a power, usb cable, and headphones unlike most manufacturers, I guess I can't be too picky. I recommend all Sony Ericsson owners have this cradle."
2,Everyone just calm down,"Either you like it or you don't. Well, to most of the population, we like it. For once we have found a group, besides Madonna, she's always known what the general public liked, that the general public does like. N Sync are a group of talented, funloving, and admirable young men. Why waste the time to compare them with other boy bands? Didn't that happen years ago with Madonna being compared to Cyndi Lauper? Well, guess who won. And went on to become the most suceessful femal artiest of all time. The same will happen here. The one's that have, will hold on to it. N Sync has what it takes, lets just see if they have as sharp of a mind, like Madonna, to keep up with the changing crowd. Until then, yes, this CD is a wonderful experience for all. Listen to the groove, your heart, and not the critics. If you like it, love it. It's our world, take control.The CD is one of the best arrangements to be produced in a while. Just enjoy the boys! They are all good. Believe me."
2,good value,Good extra cords to have at a good value. It didn't cost a great deal to have the extra cords on hand for when they loose one.
2,Great Knife,"I've tried a lot of folding pocket knives. This one leaves them all behind. I often forget I'm carrying it, yet when I need it, the knife performs. It took a very short time to break in the action to just the right tension. The steel holds its edge almost forever. The clip option is brilliant. I use it every day and will purchase another before I get through this one, just because I love it."
2,Thanks To My Mother,"The eye-opening story Thanks to My Mother, written by Susie Weskler, is a true outlook on the hardships Susie and her mother Raja endured for the three years in Nazi concentration camps. When reading Susie's story, I sometimes had to remind myself that this was actually happening to real people. It turns my stomach how cruel human beings can be.If someone is interested in World War II and what was happening to innocent people beyond the front line, then this book will be a good choice. If family history, anger, suspense, or violence interests you, then Thanks to My Mother would be a book to read. They story of her life has made a huge scar that will never go away, but she lives on, and it shows in her writing."
2,Fun and useful cane keeps mother-in-law safe,"My mother-in-law loves this cane! She uses it mostly at night to keep safe when making trips to the bathroom. The cane is easy to use, unscrews readily to insert fresh batteries, and looks and behaves in a sturdy fashion. I wouldn't know how to replace the lightbulb were it to fail, but for the price, you can't beat it with a cane, er...ah...I mean stick!"
2,CAUTION,"Be prepared to actually publish your book when you read this, because Fern Reiss will show you how with a powerfully simple, day by day, action plan. The Publishing Game: Publish a Book in 30 Days is an excellent resource for those considering self-publishing. We use Fern's action plan in our publishing company, Morgan James Publishing, for every title we publish."
2,Great book!,This book is amazing! The recipes are nice and easy to make with very clear instructions. The pictures are absolutely mouth-watering! Ina Garten is very inspiring.
2,So far these are the best pair of boots I have owned.,So far these are the best pair of boots I have ever owned. However I have yet to hike or submerge them.
2,Excellent Value,"The Garmin C320 is a very good value it has good features combined with easy operation. Although the maps and POI are a few years out of date, I still think it was a good purchase and would recommend it. I purchased a 2gb sd card on the internet for $40 delivered and loaded the entire USA and Canada and it's only 75% full. I also downloaded custom POI's Wal-Mart, Harley Dealers, Lowes, etc. now when I travel I can find more than just my destination.Now the downs1. It's hard to see on my dash in bright sunlight2. When I first turn it on it takes 2-3 minutes to find the satellites3. Sometimes the route is not what I would plan (but it will get you there)"
2,Very real,"A friend with depression recommended this book to me last summer, since I have also struggled mightily with major depression since being treated for cancer in 2010. I've read so many books on this topic in the last few years, some of which were very helpful (and some, not so much.) But Martha Manning's book was the first (and so far only) book about depression that seemed real to me. Like I could have written some of those passages myself. It was eerie, but so liberating, to read such an articulate account of what it's like to suffer from crippling depression. I've loaned (given, is more like it) my first two copies to other people, and have just ordered my third copy. I'm so thankful to Dr. Manning for writing this book. I know it was written several years ago, but this is the first book I recommend to anyone with depression or who knows someone who suffers from it."
2,"5 STARS FOR THE CD, 10 FOR THE COVER","Since the first time I saw Taylor Hicks I didn't take him seriously, but as time went on I realized it wasn't just about his singing but also about the musician this man is. His compassion and love for music goes beyond compare. Each week I looked forward to his performances and always left a smile on my face, he is indeed a true, engaging entertainer. I purchased his CD the very day it came out and was not at all disappointed, although I love Takin It To The Street, I wish there was another song in place of it since it was on the group CD. ""Do I Make You Proud"" has an inspirational message and packed with emotion which I'm sure will bring a tear to ones eye. I'm sure like others have said, it will be played at graduations or other such type events. As for the cover how can you not notice how good Taylor looks. He so deservingly won!"
2,Excellent resources & information for internet home business,This book was clear and concise on getting the information needed to determine if one is suited for self employment on the internet. The authors obviously have alot of experience with online promotion of a business. This is what I was looking for. I would recommend it to anyone who is serious about working at home thru the internet.
2,The best store bought cookies ever!,"These cookies are awesome in flavor, texture, size and price. The best store bought GFDF cookies ever."
2,Nice item,"I purchased the Galileo thermometer and barometer station as a gift. It looks nice and seems to be working well. My grandkids enjoy checking the weather on it. Especially watching the blue water move up and down. It's an interesting conversation piece. Good price on it as well. It arrived in good condition. I did have an issue with receiving the item from Amazon and then receiving a second one from BIC. I was not charged, but had a bit of a hassle contacting BIC and getting it sent back."
2,Constantly Playing it.........,"I heard ""Crazy"" sometime last summer. Wonderful! I was attending a conference in Nashville,Tn last week and ran into Javier b4 his concert that night! He was so nice and sweet. He let my friends and I take pictures with him even though he was in a hurry! The next day I went out and bought his Cd. It is in constant rotation in my cd player!"
2,My jaw is still on the floor,"Wow! Where the heck did this come from? There isn't one note here without energy, direction, and passion. The New York Phil sounds great as always but with an added layer of warmth especially in the strings and brass. For a long time, Solti's recording with Chicago was by far my favorite but I think this has overtaken it. The major difference between the two is the largo. Simply put, it has never been played better than on this recording. Thomas Stacy's english horn solo is beautifully phrased with a huge and warm timbre. The finale rips through with great vigor and intensity but is never out of balance. I could literally exhaust my vocabulary of hyperbole but I will end it here. Best recording of this great work!"
2,Excellent product,Very solid sports bra from larger sizes. Prompt mailing and product was described perfectly. The material and workmanship are excellent.
2,You Need To See This!,"O.K. i'll be the first one to say that . Kung Pow, looked pretty stupid. In fact I didn't even want to go see it, but my friends did. i went to see it with my friends, and I loved it! It was one of the funniest movies i had ever seen. I waited, and waited for it to come out on dvd, and months later it finally did. I now own it, and the dvd features are really good. if you had doubts about seeing this movie, put them a side and see it. You Will Most Likely Love It! I KNOW I DID, ONCE I GAVE IT A CHANCE! SEE IT!"
2,Most Excellent!,One very cold rainy camping trip in the Dragoons...my friend brought a copy with her (not her own unfortunately) and started reading it out loud after I scoffed at the jacket blurb. Omigosh--it was funny! So we spent the entire day huddled in back of my pickup reading this book--I've never laughed so long or loud or frequently reading *any* book! I wish they'd put it back into print!!!
2,play script purchase,The book was shipped in a timely fashion and arrived in the condition i expected. the seller is most reliable and i would purchase other merchandise from him again.
2,This Summer's Best,"Not a lot to say, except that if you're a fan of Transformers, you've got to see this! My wife was a complete skeptic and she loved it, too!"
2,We liked it!,We bought for our soon to be 5 year old grandchild. It is perfect. I can be used indoors in rainy weather and on a covered patio in sunny times.
2,Old but still good,Older game but still fun to play. The game seems to be the predecessor to Rise of Nations as the commands are nearly identical and the concepts of buildings and resourses are also similar. I was nervous about buying because I saw that it would not run on Vista but there was no mention of Windows 7. I am happy to say it runs glitch free on Windows 7.
2,Small but functional,"This product definitely runs small. I purchased this for my 2 year old for Xmas to go with her KitKraft Kitchen. The pots and pans are durable (she puts them to the test), relatively waterproof without rusting so far (she tests that too), and certainly sound like the real thing because they are metal. My only complaint is that the utensils that come with the set are entirely too small, my daughter uses them as ""forks"" because they are much more that size than play cooking utensil size. The pots are small too but that doesn't seem to bother her. Overall, she loves the product its Mom that was a bit disappointed in the size of the small size of the product overall. I read the reviews about this before purchasing and decided to take the chance, I'm still OK with the product but the price is high for what you get."
2,Family loved it,"The sound effects were cool, and it really works. easy setup, no assembly required. My nephew stopped on Christmas just to play with it."
2,Very Impressive,"Again, I am very impressed with the work of Plumb. I wish there were a few other songs on here, like drugstore Jesus. But nonetheless, the album again demonstrates Tiffany Arbuckle's God given talents, and a very talented group of musicians. All songs are great! Can't wait for a new album by this excellent band."
2,Saved my vacation at the beach!,Worked better than I'd have believed. Probably too messy to serve as a total replacement for tampons - it'd be almost impossible to use/remove in a public restroom - but it was a perfect solution for an otherwise ruined week at the beach.
2,Just what the doctor ordered.,The Tagamet arrrived promptly and was just as I expected. Good overall purchasing experience. The prodfuct was well packaged. Great deal.
2,One of her best!,"This is the first Nora Roberts book I read, and it was what prompted me to read more. This book is fabulous. It is a book that kept me up all night because I just could not put it down. Genuine Lies is a tale of intrigue that continually makes you wonder, ""Who done it?"" Nora Roberts throws in a couple of twists that are not expected. I have read many Nora Roberts books since this one, but none of them compares. It's a cliche, but this is a MUST READ!"
2,Profound and Practical Insights,"Omraam Mikhael Aivanhov is an important figure in the Western spiritual resurrgence, but is not that well known in the US.He was born in Bulgaria, became a disciple of the saintly Peter Deunov, and spent almost fifty years teaching a form of esoteric Christianity in France. His works also contain much from the Hindu and Kabbalistic traditionsThis book, like all of his others is a series of transcripts of lectures: he never wrote any books himself, and so there is occasionally some repetition, but if anything it helps to focus and clarify some of his points.Many of his insights are extremely profound but also very practical. I have found a lot of interesting material in each one of his books, but this remains a favorite.This book is well worth a look if you are interested in expanding your spiritual horizons and learning more about empowering yourself and your life."
2,added to collection,"I have always loved the O'Hurley's and had the desire to reread them. Unfortunately, I had given my copies away so this was a replacement. I won't give this away."
2,Represent,"Jay keep doing your thing baby, more prosperity, and wealth, keep your integrity, and shine on. BIG OHIO STATUS ONE"
2,almost perfect for me,The one thing that was a little annoying was the fact that the Erinee was so bent on hateing Christopher that she didnt come off as a very likeable character for me.I am all for the main characters hating eachother in the beginning and toward the middle but Ms. Woodwiss dragged it out till the last 50 pages or so.I mean she knew that her father wasn'tthe most honest of men and she wouldn't give Christopher the time of day or let him tell his story.Christopher was very determined in what he wanted and I knew right away what he was trying to do but I loved the story line and ho9w he went about it.
2,100% recommend this pillow!,"Over the past 15 years I've tried many types of back pillows, THIS PILLOW IS GREAT. I own several and recommend them to others. I've loaned mine to friends; they've purchased their own afterwards. This pillow is awesome to use when traveling, especially on a plane. Just a small amount of air in the pillow allows relief from back strain. I would not be able to travel without this pillow. My first pillow came from my physical therapist after having back surgery. I previously purchased this pillow online at a much higher price than offered here. I have not been able to find this pillow in retail stores, only online. I was happy to see it available on Amazon. I 100% RECOMMEND THIS PILLOW."
2,Great Seller. Fast. Worth the price :),"The only reason why it's not 5 start is because I only got it and I can't promise it's perfect, but I am very delighted that the product was delivered a day early. Packaged right and it is working just fine. Thank you. I'd definitely buy again."
2,"I'm a bit confused by those who find it ""embarrassing""",I can't think of anything more embarassing than dealing with a giant tantrum in public. Go with what works -- and this does!
2,hooray for dvd's through the mail,"I had heard great things about this series but since I do not have showtime had not been able to actual view it myself. So, on a whim I ordered the 1st series and was extremely satisfied with my purchase. The dvd's arrived within days of my order in great condition. I have watched the whole series and am super happy with my purchase as I will be re-gifting it to a friend that has also been unable to see the show for herself."
2,Fabulous Historical Eroticism,"This is the absolute best erotic book I've ever read.It has just the right style of subtle, sophisticated arousal."
2,The Oregon Desert,This is a large book with heavy pages and with lots of pictures. If you are at all interested in the southeast desert of Oregon you'll enjoy this book. It is an older book but has been well kept and is very clean. It was sent very quickly and I am still reading it. So enjoy! Nancy
2,Brilliant :-),"I am slowly learning to like yoga. It's still not my absolute favourite workout, but this dvd is helping me even more to enjoy it better. It truly is for beginners and even I found it easy(ish) to do.Desi is a great instructor and she has a clear, calm way of cuing and the camera work also allows you to see the moves better and practice them yourself and follow along well. There are two workouts, Solar and Lunar, which seem to be a trend now (doing an AM and PM workout). The Solar one is energy boosting and the Lunar routine is more stretchy and slower paced to be relaxing. It is meant to also lengthen your muscles which I feel it is probably doing.I've done this three times now and I'm constantly getting a little better. I find it great to do on hectic days because it really is relaxing, and each workout is under a half hour so it's not too hard to fit into your day. I like this a lot and would highly recommend it to almost everyone. It is very do-able."
2,Calculator,this calculator arrive in great shape and is very useful for my class. thank you so much.KB
2,Stomp Out Loud,I was totally entertained and amazed at the talent of these young people. It can be watched numerous times without ever getting bored. Highly recommend.
2,I love this CD,"I saw this in the top ten of the NPR music critic and I had to check it out.It doesn't disappoint. The cranks to the Chinese restaurant and the STD clinic are way funny. I love how catchy all the songs are, in addition to making me laugh. I have to get ""Cats are C__ts"" out of my head or I'll get fired for sure. Jack Black helping Triumph blast ""Bob Barker"" killed me. Maybe I'm ill but the dirtiest songs ""My Mama"" and ""You have to Work Blue"" are also incredible.Listening to Triumph is like going back to the 50's and 60's. His songs, crudeness and one-liners are very old-fashioned but the jokes are sharp and hilarious. The DVD is full of great battles with people like Jared, the Dell Guy and Big Pussy, all trying their best to go toe-to-toe with the King of Poop. Of course, Triumph always wins, and so will you!"
2,Great little product,"These legs are great. Even when not extended, they raise the laptop about 1/3 of an inch. When extended, the vents at the bottom of my laptop are completely free to breathe. I like these because I do not need to carry around an extra laptop stand everywhere I go. I also like that I do not need to worry about whether the vents on the bottom of my laptop are intake or exhaust vents (which is an issue with external stands with built-in fans). I also stuck these on the battery in the back-center of my laptop which seems to stay cooler than the laptop itself. Even though they are not at the very edges of my laptop, my laptop does not wobble, slide, or otherwise move whatsoever.Update: Like others, I had to replace the tape. However, some 3M poster strips did the trick. I am still happy I bought this product."
2,Hooray! Finally FOUND it!,Got involved in the series late -- never could find the first book. I'm SO glad they published this collection so I could get it!
2,Valentine's Day,This is such a cute movie and has so many amazing actors and actresses in it! I like how they're all connected in some way. I would definitely recommend it to anyone!
2,This fudge is awesome!,Incredible vanilla fudge flavored with vanilla bean paste. So rich and creamy it melts in your mouth! Perfect for any vanilla or white chocolate lover... order yours today!
2,Like this Cutting Board,"I don't have a whole lot to say, because in the end it's a cutting board. I am impressed though with its light weight, the fact it's dishwasher safe (which is really nice), and the fact that it's certified by the NSF. Overall, I'm very satisfied."
2,ONE OF THE BEST METAL ALBUMS THIS MILLENIUM,Words can't desribe this album. Its like Iced earth is starting a new era with Tim on vocals. Tim complements Iced Earth's powerhouse style just as much as Matt did.The Gettysburg piece is phenomenal. if you want a solid metal album BUY THIS
2,Technology catches up with my imagination,"This is fantastic. A portable library without a bookbag. And the discount pricing on the books has made the Kindle pay for itself already. I'm still amazed at holding a Kindle up next to a 'hard copy', and being able to see the type on the Kindle better. And the option to change font size is convenient. And my friends are jealous - Bonus!"
2,Adorable,My young adult daughter wants a German Shepard and this was the perfect gift! It is made well and the coloring is excellent.
2,Just Purchased the Book...,"I've just purchased this book today, and am looking forward to delving into it shortly! However, I would like to make a comment on all the negative press Marie Antoinnette & Louis XVI received during their reign. It seems all throughout history, whenever someone is unhappy with the way the present regime is running things, those trying to over throw the it, such as the Napoleons, Lenins & Stalins, are far more tyrannical and spend thrifts than their predecessors. Anyway, just some food for thought!"
2,Great Toy,"""Santa"" brought this for my son last year for Christmas. He was 9 months old, and couldn't walk yet, but he could (and did!) play with the activities on the bottom of the activity center. A couple weeks later, he started pulling himself up, and we encountered the only problem we've ever really had. It's to narrow to be really stable for early walkers to hold on to. This wobbly stage passed, and he's still playing with it at 21 months. We have the plug for the ball chute, and didn't put it in for a long time because he loved that part so much. We finally put it in when we got tired of prying his giant legos out of the chute. He got his arm stuck one time, but I gently removed it and no harm was done."
2,A+,"headphones work wonderfully. I purchased these to use with the Rosetta Stone language program (which, by the way I heartily recommend!) and they've worked exceptionally well. The microphone picks up my voice clearly with no background static, the earphones are comfortable and convenient, and the product functions very well!"
2,Simple and lively description of our Lovely Universe,"This book was recently refered by my friend. This book contains very simple, lucid description of the universe. This book describes mainly the origin and fate of the universe in a very simple terms. If you have not got chance to work on astonomy, or go into space, please read this book, you will definitely get a feel of our lovely univese, with the finest brain of our time, guiding you.Two doubts are there in my mind : No. 1. What is before the Singularity ? No. 2. If universe is expanding, then what is that space, in which it is expanding. May other readers clarify.I recommend this book to everybody, whatever profession he/she is in, not only because it describes our lovely home we live in, but also because it has been written by one of the greatest genius of our time, so we get an opportunity to see into his brain too."
2,A correction,"Below someone said 'tall tales from the tallest python,' which is not true. The tales may be drawn out in length, and so may the subject, but as far as pythons go, John Cleese was the longest."
2,Personally Good Entertainment,"I personally like the Burn Notice television series. It has a good plot, good acting, and nice Florida scenery. Thank You."
2,Good but not worth the price,This is a really good daily body wash that left me skin feeling super smooth and soft. Very clean feeling. The downside is it has a bit of a chemical smell. I would prefer no scent or a scent that smells a bit better. It is also expensive.I prefer to use the once a week product to deep clean my skin and get it smooth:[...]
2,Beautiful!,Love this watch! I had one similar a couple of years ago. Beautiful and very good quality. Definitely would recommend buying.
2,Pillage and Plunder,"Probably one of the best overall books on the subject of piracy, myth and reality, that I have read. Cordingly covers the history, the movies, the books, the truths and the untruths. He covers the pirate havens, common practices, origins, the big names and little names. Not just a dry narrative, but a fun read.If you were to buy one book on the topic of piracy, this should be it (Angus Konstam's History of Pirates would be next in line). It is a must for any budding pirate historian. P-)"
2,Intellectual Journalism,"The title is descriptive--these are adventures, not investigations. Levy writes about encounters he has had with the many characters of French high-culture, he met so-and-so at a book signing, or in a cafe, this is what they said to each other, and how it was surprising, or disappointing. These encounters are entry-points for meditations on the larger political involvements of these thinkers. This is in no way a comprehensive history, but rather a series of snapshots, mostly embarrassing for those pictured. A good read, but almost gossipy in tone; this book is intended only for those who already have opinions about the people and ideas being discussed."
2,"THE BEST, GRUESOME, PSYCHOLOGICAL, THRILLING, BOOK EVER",This book was great. I could not believe how good this book really was. Eventhough Patterson is a little tidious in information it was still good. The killings were so detailed I could see them so vividly. When they were in court and he is performing the schezophreniac thing-a-magig i was about to jump out of my seat. The book only took me three days to read. The high suspension and fast-pacing blew me away. I have read more gritty and grisly books but this book kept the right balance. I recommend this book to anyone. (Not children)A-
2,I've fallen in love again,"I had this as a LP record many years ago, and was absolutely thrilled to find the CD. I had always loved Lanza's voice, but I now realize that he was without a doubt one of the best tenor voices of the century. His ability to sing so many different types of songs is astounding. His voice is strong, filled with emotion and in some of the songs you can hear that he is hugely enjoying himself. What an incredible pity that he died at such a young age and was never able to fulfill all that he could have been."
2,Wow! Wow! Wow!,"Yes, I exclaimed Wow! This camera is great. I've had it a week (It's now been months, and this camera still rules) and, frankly, I'm still trying to figure out half of the bells and whistles it comes with (I'm getting them down pat, and love the results). I'm coming off of an Olympus 3.2 mp and I can't get over the fact that this camera comes from Panasonic. The 12x zoom in incomparable. Picture quality is excellent. I recently used it at an indoor affair and it performed perfectly with and w/o the built in flash. Used it for some really close ups of flora while kayaking and still can't believe the quality of the photos (excellent results no matter the subject). I haven't come across anything negative and I've been giving it a workout. Good job Panasonic, thanks. And for the money this camera is a true bargain."
2,TEST EQUIPMENT,"HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS TOOL. WORKS GREAT AND GIVES YOU A HEADS UP ON ANY PROBLEMS BEFORE YOU TAKE IT TO A GARAGE. SOME THINGS YOU CAN DO YOURSELF IF YOU KNOW THE PROBLEM. CODES ARE EASY TO FIND ONLINE. DELIVERY WAS PROMPT AND HAVE HAD NO PROBLEMS USING IT. INSTRUCTIONS ARE BASIC AND TO THE POINT, BUT SUFFICIENT."
2,dancing bear watch,Great watch. Only one around I could find. You will not be unhappy with this one.
2,She saved the BEST for last!! TINA ROCKS!!,"The BEST Tina concert released on video to date! Tina's 2000 performance in London is the most energetic, upbeat and enthusiastic yet! Highlights of this rock & roll materpiece include Tina's latest dance hit, ABSOLUTELY NOTHING'S CHANGED, the best live performance ever of PRIVATE DANCER, Tina's sizzling version of I HEARD IT THROUGH THE GRAPEVINE, as well as classics FOOL IN LOVE, WHAT'S LOVE, PROUD MARY and more! If possible, go for the DVD version! The DVD includes 2 hits that are not on the VHS, WHEN THE HEARTACHE IS OVER and TWENTY FOUR SEVEN. Tina ROCKS!! A+"
2,This book is an insight to the life of Theodore Roosevelt.,"Mr. Morris goes into much detail about Teddy's life. From his early child hood, as he tries to 'build his body' until he recieves the presidency. The politics were helpful to understand some of the things that President Roosevelt did in his life. It's the best book I've ever read on Theodore Roosevelt."
2,Excellent instruction.,"I really got a lot out of this book. In the military, we were trained to use the weaver stance. This book points out some of the advantages of the isosceles stance as well as of the mechanics and ergonomics. This book does a good job of teaching the other aspects of shooting such as grip, aiming, trigger control, etc. For shooters that have never had any formal instruction or that currently use the weaver stance, this book is highly recommended."
2,Captain on N DVD...Nuff Said,"I have to admit I when I saw the title, ""featuring Captain N: The Gamemaster"" I was like, what?! Then I saw the episodes listed on this DVD. Yep, that's the same Captain N I remember watching on NBC. So, yea, I had to order right away. Once I got my disc, I also noticed that Voltron & Defenders of the Earth was on there. Definitely, a cool plus too. But still, Captain N alone warranted a purchase on my part. Now, the details of this DVD...Captain N: The Gamemaster1. Misadventures in Robin Hood Woods2. A Tale of Two Dogs3. Totally Tetrisized4. The Fractured Fantasy of Captain NVoltron1. Space Explorers Captured2. Escape to Another PlanetDefenders of the Earth1. Escape from Mongo2. Creation of MonitorHopefully Volume 3 will have more Captain N episodes *keeps fingers crossed*"
2,Genie garage door opener,Easy to set-up and works great. I wish the feel of the buttons would be better but not a show-stopper.
2,Good value for money,"This little FM transmitter does just what is says it does, not more not less. For the price is a good purchase. If the FM band is too busy in your zone it might sound with a bit of interference. Otherwise is OK."
2,Very practical vacuum cleaner,Practical and light vacuum cleaner that is very easy to use. Would definitely recommend it !
2,Blu-Ray brings quality again.,I was pretty upset with the DVD version of this film. But the Blu-ray really comes through. The picture is great and so is the sound.
2,I am satisfied with the product,I bought this product as a gift and had it shipped directly. It arrived in time and created a good impression. I recommend it.
2,Good Food,I bought this polish to care for my kangaroo leather soccer boots. It really softened up the leather and I don't have to worry about getting them wet or cracking. Good stuff.
2,Eye opening experience,Amazing book! Definitely opened my eyes to the truth about abortion. Francine Rivers is a wonderful Christian writer and am in love with her novels.
2,Whipped Cream & Other Delights,"A walk down memory lane for me. Enjoyed this CD very much!! All of the delightful recordings I remember from my youth. I listen to it when I am feeling low & it perks me right up!!TeriCenterville, MD"
2,I love it,"I discovered David Eddings when a friend told me that if I liked Dragonlance I would love this. Never truer words were said. The way Eddings writes makes you believe in the characters, you know them. I specially like the first book because the hero, Garion, has no idea whatsoever of what's going on around him. It's not that he's dumb, he's got a good mind but if they take you out of an easy farmer life onto a ""let's save the world"" one it's sure gonna take you a little bit to get used to the idea."
2,Kindle l,"I chose to purchase a refurbished Kindle 1 because of the user replaceable battery and the sd card. It was so easy to figure out. I love to read but when I find I have time, I don't have a book...until now. Just over Christmas break, I've read two books."
2,Beautiful soundtrack!,This soundtrack has wonderful sound quality and includes all of the compositions I remember from the movie. The instrumentals are gorgeous. A must-have for any fan of the movie!
2,Classic Movie - A must see for Bette Davis fans.,"I've seen this movie too many times to count and never tire of watching this truly classic Bette Davis performance. Excellent performances by a great ensemble cast, including a very young Marilyn Monroe, playing to type, but very effective. This movie is made for rainy days and Sundays when you don't want to watch football or golf."
2,The best explanation of the core of Christianity I have read. Fascinating.,"It has been a while since I last got excited about a book, but this book inspired me. This book gives both rational arguments for Christianity and sound explanations of core Christian doctrines."
2,Sweet Euroangel.,"There's no one like Basia--mebbe Sade or Lemmieux from the Groove Theory are closely cut, but there's only one Basia. And thank the spirits for that. This CD will be well worth the listener's money--you may wanna buy a couple of them because you'll wear it out--every cut is so fresh and new it's like heaven. I originally thought kinda cheated because one of my faves ""Miles Away"" wasn't on this Greatest hits CD but, I quickly got over that. This is too good to complain about. She is really one of the best singers out there, per-i-od! I enthusiastically recommend you get this and experience her for yourself. Then, remember I told you so..."
2,I love this movie,"For someone who did not grow up on the adventures of Sherlock Holmes, I am not qualified to compare this movie to any other films, tv shows, or books about this wonderful character. I can say that I think Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law make up the pefect team of smarts, wits and just a dash of insanity. As soon as you think you've figured out what all is going on, there will be another twist or new piece to the puzzle added. I highly, highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves mystery, action and more comedy than what you would expect."
2,"Please, read my review....","I am a collage student and I am studying engineering physics. I have had a hard time with religion all of my life wandering if I should or should not believe in, at least, something. Now, I know that it sounds odd that the creator of Dilbert wrote a book that helped me find my way, but it is true. God's Debris is one of the best books I have ever read. I have referred this book to all of my friends and classmates, some have read it and I believe that my view is shared by the others. I recommend this book to anyone who wants a challenge. A challenge to reassess what they know and what they think they know. I just want to thak Scott Adams for helping me think."
2,"Great but, Extra Water Drainage is Annoying","This system is awesome. My only complaint is that following a simple brew, there is always extra water that drains out. The catch tray has to be emptied every 2 cups. That's annoying when you're at the office and you don't have a sink in your cube. You end up having to balance the catch tray hoping not to spill any on the way to the kitchen."
2,My first book on WWII and now I'm looking for more!,"After watching Saving Private Ryan, I wanted to learn more about what happened after D-day and was directed to this book. Easy to read and follow, without too much technical strategy/jargon, the book gives both a general perspective of the campaign and personal views from the soldiers in the foxholes. While it may sound cliche, after a while, you can almost hear the German 88's rumbling in the background."
2,Salvation is from the Jews,"Excellent book, full of biblical references. Wonderful history of Jewish and Christian religiions. Provides great understanding of Jewish history up to present time."
2,FRESH/MOTIVATING INFORMATION,"This book tells you exactly what will help you to reach your fitness goals because it is very clear and to the point. It talks about situations we all encounter in our quest for fitness and health. Tawni speaks so openly about her own struggles that I'm sure you can relate. Tawni is honest, warm, articulate and informative. What I liked about the book so much is that it is written by someone like US - not a doctor, dietician, nurse, etc. someone that is at my level when it comes to the weight loss situation. She instantly becomes your best friend. The best part is that it doesn't concentrate on the ""d"" (diet) word. If you're looking for something fresh and motivating - read the book."
2,Woman in the Middle,"The survival of the British monarchy as a popular institution owes a lot to its queens who were, more often than not, more intelligent than their husbands. Caroline of Ansbach is such a queen. Well-educated and from one of the poorer German principalities, Caroline married into the boorish House of Hanover. It isn't long before she discovered she's caught between a loathsome, vindictive father-in-law, George I, and her not-too-bright and domineering husband, the future George II.The House of Hanover, newly ascended to the English throne, would not have survived on the personal popularity of its kings. It took the cleverness of Caroline coupled with that of Sir Robert Walpole, the Prime Minister, to keep things in balance. Jean Plaidy tells the tale of the reign of George I through the personal trauma of this most remarkable of English Queens."
2,John Mayer is a good artist,"I own this CD and personally I like it better than Heavier Things. His three best songs ""No Such Thing"", ""Why Georgia"" and ""Your Body is a Wonderland"" are all my favorite. I wanted this CD because I heard Your Body is a Wonderland on the radio a million times and No Such Thing and I liked it. I'd give this CD 4.5 stars. John Mayer is one of my favorite artists. And the songs are really good. But it's just my opinion."
2,San Francisco movie,This seller was very prompt. I would buy from them again. The movie was as I remembered it. A treasure from the past.
2,Absolutely fantastic,"I'm not usually a huge fan of war stories, but this one was an intriguing read. Turtledove's character expositions were the biggest draw for me; my usual reluctance to enjoy details of guns and tactics was surmountable because I honestly cared about the soldiers. I can hardly wait to dive into more of these books!"
2,Tangled dvd,"This is a GREAT choice of our most TERRIFIC purchases via Amazon.com for our little princess lovers & our little ""Flynn Rider Wanna-Be's"" !!! They have SOOOO enjoyed it!!! so we were super happy to purchase this item which they beg to watch EVERDAY! REALLY GREAT ITEM!"
2,Great Christmas fun,"Skipping Christmas is great and an enjoyable read. I like the way Grisham deals with Christmas from various points of view. His portrayal Luther and Nora Krank is XLNT. I saw a lot of my thoughts and feelings in them. To go into detail may take away from such a good story, so I won't. Pick the book up and read it. It is good for some laughs as well as a multi-faceted view of Christmas."
2,BEFORE THERE WAS SHRED!,"Before there was shred, before anyone knew what to label it or how to market it, there was Frank Marino. But he was much more then a speed freak, as this retrospective (which traces his band's late-seventies Columbia years) clearly demonstrates. Songs like ""Dragonfly"" (a haunting bit of psychedelic funk) and ""Requiem For a Sinner"" (with it's droney, Middle-Eastern overtones and Marino's amazing Arabic-tinged guitar solo) are not merely testaments to his agility but also to his adventurous and creative spirit. Of course,Frank often just liked to boogie, as he most dramatically does on the scathing live versions of ""Johnny B. Goode"" and ""Who Do Ya Love,"" where he plays some of the fastest and intense blues licks ever heard by man. Long may Marino wail!"
2,made my cat less annoying!,"I've had it for about 2 weeks and I love it. Originally I got it so my cat would stop annoying me for food 24/7 by lessening my association with food and to feed him at a consistent time. I programmed it to feed him in the morning and a snack in the afternoon, however I still feed him dinner (because he eats wet food). It has helped so much, now he only bothers me at dinner time and he seems much happier now that he gets fed 3x a day. I haven't had any problems with my cat moving the tray slot and eating extra from there and programming the meal times is ridiculously easy. There is a digital clock on the inside and you just program the meal times according to the digital clock (no setting a timer to every 6-12 hours)."
2,Waiting for life to end,"Last of the Summer Wine is the soft, amusing tale of a whole world of characters living out the end of life in a childish search for meaning. They exist and wander in a lush, colorful world of a government financed time warp that was England before anyone had to work at living. The memories of a childhood interrupted by a war they ""won"" are interlaced with an endless supply of frustrations from the peace they ""lost"", and the daily attempts to find some form of solace in the Yorkshire hills. The characters are timeless, the fun surprising yet gentle on the mind. It is obvious why this televison show has lasted so long."
2,GREAT BOOK... Actually quite creepy in a way,"This is a great book. Never hearing oF Marueen Dowd, I picked the book up just on its title, Once I started reading it I havent been able to put it down(well except for now to write this review). Im utterly amazed, that if infact these are real collums that were assembled to form a anthology, and if she didnt edit the chapters and they are indeed the way they appeared in the papper, it utterly striking to me than on how accurate Marueen has potrayed the events leading up to now... Was anyone in the white house actually reading these pieces while they were orginally published, tham it stupidfy's(sp?) me why things have gotten as out of control as they are now... W. is very scary man, it amazes me that a c student can become president (as W. has so amazingly said).... hmm what an aspiration to look up to...."
2,Dope ass rims,"I got both the front and back rims for my cruiser as well as the white-wall tires. They both were just as shown in the picture, chrome plated and they come with everything you need to put them on your bike. Make sure to have an old coaster break to see how to assemble the one on the back rim because it can be a little tricky. Overall, these rims are awesome. I put the white-wall tires on (also from the same seller) and they are dope!"
2,This author at her best!,"I've read 60 of her books so far and I believe this to be the most well written in terms of beautifully soaring prose, poetical love notes, inspiring life-changing conversions and engaging secondary characters. Such a delight that I wish there were a sequel to this one.Love-at-first-sight on best man John Saxon's part as he espies Mary Elizabeth walk up the isle as maid-of-honor. She drives him to the train station after the wedding as he blurts out his love. As Mary tries to find out all about him from his friends, they embark on a long-distance correspondence. By the time they see each other again, their lives have become gloriously entangled.Told from the standpoint of both lovers (more from Mary), and key mutual friend of theirs, a well-developed early-teen character. More humor than usual from GLH. Best written of what I've seen so far, and tied for my favorite of hers with about eight other stories."
2,"""Have we passed this way before?""","The author uses a wonderful sense of time and place, in presenting the story of a womans survival in a nineteenth century silver boomtown. In addition to the rich historical detail and insights to everyday life from a bygone era, Ms. Berrington has the courage to tell her personal experience which raises moving and provocative questions regarding spiritual passages. After reading this book you too will ask ""have we passed this way before?"""
2,Baby Ryan Valance,The product was delivered in just a few days and was in excellent condition. The price was great! A good buy!
2,too small,"This magnet, though very strong, is too small to cover much ground. I wanted to use it where old lumber with nails had been burned in a pretty large pile. I should have paid more attention to the dimensions given for the product than I did to the pictures. It is difficult to remove small pieces of steel from the magnet because of how strong it is. I should have bought a larger magnet than this one. I feel sure that this magnet would work fine for uses other than mine."
2,!,"THIS IS THE FULLY DEVELOPED RUSH OF THEIR 'EARLY PERIOD'...AND I CONSIDER THIS CLASSIC OF AN EXCITING ALBUM 'EARLY RUSH' ALONG THE LINES OF CARRESS OF STEAL AND FLY BY NIGHT...THE BIG CHANGES WOULD COME WITH KINGS AND HEMISPHERES A LITTLE LATER ON WHERE ALEX'S GUITAR WOULD START SINGING IT'S OWN LITTLE CATCHY SONG PARTS WITHIN SONGS...THIS RUSH ALBUM HERE IS MEAN, FIERCE CAPTAIN BEYOND-LIKE PROG THAT EXPLODES WITH PASSION AND ANGER...LIKE ALL RUSH IT IS LOADED WITH AMBIANCE AND BRADY BUNCH LIKE MELODIES BUT PACKAGED TO EXPLODE LIKE A NUCLEAR BOMB...GEDDY AND NEIL ROCK OUT COMPLICATED BUT ALEX IS MORE THAN HANGING ON FOR THE RIDE...THE SONGS DO GET MELLOW AFTER A WHILE BUT THATS OK...RUSH WERE 'FINDING THEIR WAY'....A FIVE STAR CLASSIC EPIC ! BUY THIS NOW AND TELL A FRIEND !"
2,Quality product,"Surprise! I ordered free shipping and this product arrived within 2 days at the height of the Christmas season. A tip of the hat to Amazon.com. This brewer is definitely a quality product and I am comfortable with what I paid for it. My first brew was stale, ground decaf, so I have yet to judge the quality from ground Starbucks, however, I can say it is definitely HOT. Do not believe anyone who says the coffee from this brewer is luke warm. It has all the features to produce a superb cup of coffee all the way down to the charcoal filter and high quality gold tone filter, especially for smaller measures (4 cups and less). I am satisfied withthis purchase. The one drawback is no outside water level indicator. It is on the inside but water poured from the pot is the true measure anyway."
2,Chamberlain CLDM1 Clicker Garage Door Monitor,Item as described - great price. Seller even answers stupid questions cause I didn't properly read instructions
2,Heat,This is Stuart Woods best ever book. It contains alot of suspense and keeps your eyes glued to the pages. The plot is well planned and the story is well written. You will not be dissapointed with this one.
2,Ja rules awsome,"Ja rule keeps it real, 50 cent is just a hater. Theres nothing else to say... anyway this cd was pretty good, if you like ja rule go get it"
2,Rozelle reminds us of a sense of community that has vanished,"Ron Rozelle weaves an excellent memoir which tells of a sense of community, personal loss and growth. Memoirs tend to drift off and ramble leaving the reader anxious to finish the tale and move on. However, Rozelle leaves the reader wanting more. The characters of Oakwood, Texas are presented in such a way that the reader feels as if he/she is familiar with these people. ""Into That Good Night"" feels like you are having a one on one conversation with Rozelle. The subject of Alzheimer's is dealt with in a manner that shows the impact of the disease not only on the patient, but the extended family. This book is important and a must read."
2,hdmi cable a hidden success,My package may have came later.. however I finally got my package of my HDMI cables in the mail.. great for the price of cheap
2,Mr. Penick Encourages & Guides Without Being Technical,"This book provides the best of Penick's great anecdotes. He has so many golf related stories from his days of teaching, coaching, and assisting, and each one sheds a new perspective on this timeless game. His best contribution to golf writing is his ability to provide clear visuals in association with sound golfing principles. He doesn't leave the reading wondering how to implement an idea, but puts it in concrete terms by providing examples from his own life as well as the people he coached. Apart from the wonderful golf tips, this is just a plain good read, which borders on an autobiography. If you love the sport and you love life, you will truly enjoy this book."
2,Mari's the best,"I have been doing Mari's pilates for years and I really find that no one else compares. Whenever I loan out one too many copies, I have to buy a replacement and it is always Mari. The 20 minute workout is a great quickie and the 50-minute workout is a good overall pilates workout. She provides enough instruction without slowing the whole thing down, and you are continually encouraged to work at your own pace. I have recommended and continue to recommend to all of my friends."
2,From 850 travel experiences for all ages to a rundown of every country in the world and a 2009 travel planner,"Lonely Planet, a prime publisher of independent travel books, provides a collection of highlights for 2009: the best places to go and things to do all around the world, using knowledge of its staff and authors to provide year's worth of possible journeys. From 850 travel experiences for all ages to a rundown of every country in the world and a 2009 travel planner with 50 adventures in a monthly calendar, BEST IN TRAVEL 2009 is a pick for any general-interest lending library strong in overseas travel guides."
2,does what you'd expect,Used the RC930 for my series 2 tivo. Plugged it in and it worked exactly as I expected.Probably wouldn't have bought it if I'd realized the series 2 can use a wifi adapter instead of a phone line.
2,Love the bag,"Excellent product, it shipped fast. The construction is sturdy and is able to handle normal usage. I am very happy with it, as it does what is intended"
2,Kay Hanley rocks,"This CD finally gives Kay Hanley a chance to exhibit her remarkable vocal talents. Her limited work from the soundtrack to ""10 Things I Hate About You"" gave us a glimpse, but this soundtrack is the one to buy. Several of the tracks are ***** all the way, especially 3 Small Words, Turn Around, Wild Child and the clever remake of the original cartoon's theme song. Absolutely love the guitar work."
2,"FUN, NOSTALGIAC TOYS","I think this toy set is wonderful. Any fan of GI JOE will enjoy it. There are MINOR things to nit pick at(JINX looks like battle cat from he-man and firefly is now wreckage????). Other than that, this set is pretty cool. It will display nicely whether you open the packaging or not. A must for any die-hard GI JOE fan/collector."
2,WTF,"HAHAHA --- What is going on with the ""Product Description"" above??? I love it so much, and although I'm inclined to say that it's totally inaccurate, there may yet be some truth to it!"
2,Best bang for the dollar...,This was purchased to be used in my truck as a back massager lol. Well worth the money and will fit in several places requiring no special installation.
2,One you will never forget,"Iwould like to rate this movie with my own ratings. There are not enough stars in your ratings, that could give Sneezy Waters the credit he deserves,in the performance of singing the song,These Men With Broken Hearts.Iwatched this movie when it first was played on TV,and I am still watching it.There was something about the way he sang,or maybe I should say the way he talked through this song, that has left a mark on my heart,for the sad and lonely Hank Williams. Snezzy Waters must have had help from and Angel, to sing that song with such emotion, and make it all the way through it with-out breaking down crying.Everbody needs to watch this movie, if only to listen, to the words of the song Men With Broken Hearts.I ordered me another copy of it. What else could I possibly say, except get it while you still can.I would like to know who wrote the words to that song. Was it Hank Williams? God Bless Him."
2,Start of a great Military Science Fiction series,"I've read most of the Military Science fiction staples, and this book ended up being one of my favorites. I really enjoy the author's writing style, offering a humorous point of view of the main character. I've finished the entire 5 book series, and it ended up being one of my favorite military science fiction book series, maybe the best right now. This is one of those books that is hard to put down. And the story and writing are really well done."
2,Great price and great product,"This hamper is available at several local stores including specialty baby stores in our area for a much higher price. It's sturdy, comes with different colored accent ties, and has a liner. For the price, you can't beat it."
2,Ok,"We bought this for our 7 year old son, he loves to draw robots! There was some inappropriate female bodies in the back of the book, we just took a box cutter and removed those pages before we gave him the book. (He hasnt noticed)He has used this book alot as a reference for his drawings! He loves itt!"
2,Wonderful treat or breakfast!,"I absolutely LOVE the Pumpkin Spice bars! Not only are they made with natural ingredients and are amazingly good for you, they taste great! Especially if you like your Granola bars nice and hard. I didn't think these would taste so well, but the pumpkin and spice flavor is wonderful!Go Kashi!"
2,Laugh out loud funny!,"This book was so funny for any woman who has been in a wedding, planned a wedding or attending friends weddings. You will laugh out loud funny from this book and be looking for more when you are through!"
2,Study The Mystery Paragraph,"Deville's book is an excellent history of the prose poem from Baudelaire to Stein to as well as a close study of important figures in the prose poem such as Russel Edson, Robert Bly, and Charles Simic. It started out a little slow, perhaps because it's been a few months since I've read a critical text, but then it became very readable. I was using this book to prepare for a prose poem panel discussion at a writing conference and found it extremely useful. It seems like the prose poem is finally well on its way to becoming a more accepted form. Recent collections such as Tony Tost's ""The Invisible Bride"" and Mary Koncel's ""You Can Tell The Horse Anything"" further this point. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested on prose poems, but don't expect an easy definition."
2,Brilliant Memoir with Bright Insights!,"Honky is a memoir in which Dalton Conley reflects on his youth. He tells of his position that seems so peculiar and uncommon: a white minority. What is so great about this book is that it is a lesson in racial and social stratification; however, by weaving wit, wisdom, and analysis, Conley makes it feel as though it is just a novel. This is a true example of making academic analysis personal and exciting to read, something we do not see too much of these days.I was first inspired to read this book after taking Dalton Conley's Introduction to Sociology Course at NYU. He makes his presence known in person as well as the fact that he makes his voice come through the pages of Honky."
2,Informative,Very good work by a knowledgeable Author. Daniel Ali has proven his first-hand life experience and subject knowledge beyond doubt.
2,Like the expanded short story,"the longer devoloped held you understand the storyline betterbought this on VHS, then Laserdisc now DVD I lost the othersWhen we as people go to Mars I hope we understand that we are there not here any longer"
2,useful in the bath,These mesh organizers are awesome because they don't rust and you can throw them in the washer if they start to get a hard water build up or you spill soap or shampoo on them; they also fit a good many items so that you don't have to have them sitting on the shelves in the shower and they are right there to easily grab plus it has hooks for sponges or whatever. Very nice!
2,Awesome,"Hands down the best and most comfortable mouse I've ever used. I scoffed at paying so much for such a common piece of equipment, but regretted my decision when I bought a cheap piece of crap.This mouse is frickin amazing. Worth every penny. I've since bought several others for my other desktop and laptop computers. Things sick."
2,very durable,This chain is very delicate and attractive and at the same time is very durable. This is the second summer I've worn it and it still looks like new.
2,coloring for adults,"""Get out your crayons and your pencils"" This is mommy's coloring book-something every mom should have. The intricate line drawings offer hours of coloring that produce very framable finished works. This is great for plane trips, hospital visits, or just plain procrastination. Next time your boss calls say your are coloring and mean it. I recommend fine tip markers or quality colored pencils."
2,Cute modern fairy tale,"The first time I watched Coraline, I missed too much of the beginning, and just didn't get it.Then my daughter wanted to watch it, so I sat down with her.And I found myself really liking the spunky little lead character.The storytelling is quirky but engaging; a little reminiscent of Tim Burton.The animation is excellent, and it's nice to see a happy ending.Oh, and the 3D version is a must, definitely worth the couple extra dollars."
2,"Witty, gentle, surreal - a perfect piece of animation.","In the UK, everyone loves Wallace & Grommit. They seem to appeal to tiny children and (in my case) middle-aged ex-hippies alike. The rich complexity of the visual imagery, the barmy scenario presented in a totally matter-of-fact way, and the way they combine innocence with gentle surrealism, with true humour - from the north of England, like (oddly enough) The Full Monty. The joy is that it appeals to my many friends in the USA as well."
2,excellent workout,"I am 40 years old.I have been buying workout videos since about age 20.In 20 years, this is the best video I have ever purchased.It is 20 minutes. 3 different workouts.No more excuses.YOU CAN FIND 20 MINUTES !!3 COMPLETE WORKOUTS. ABS, CARDIO, AND WEIGHTS.Buy it already."
2,Great,Great for an old cd. it came in quick and works great. the casing was not broken at all and the price was not bad.
2,Not really about the Robot..,"Hugo is a film that was miscast. From the advertisements it appears to be child's film about a mechanical robot. From the trailer we assume that there is something magical about this little robot and that it is the subject of the film. If you see the movie with that in mind, waiting for the robot to take on a life of its own, you will likely become bored or disappointed and lack interest in the real storyline. In reality, the robot is more prop than actor. This might explain why Hugo didn't get a wider audience when it made its theatrical run. Like the real subject of the movie, the fictionalized life of turn of the century film maker and magician, Georges Méliès, there is slight of hand, but in this case misleading the audience does not amaze them. See Hugo, but view it with curiosity about the magic of film making and how synchronicity brings unexpected solutions."
2,Not to be forgotten,Our education systems usually breeze past this very important part of our American history. This book introduces to the reader major participents in the Civil War in their early military careers.
2,Chiltons Auto Repair Manual-Ford Explorer,I have used Chilton manuals for many years and have found them to have excellent coverage of their subject. This one is no exception. I purchased this manual along with Haynes manual as they compliment each other. I would be hard pressed to make a choice between the two.

2,GOOD GETTIN BETTER,"PAUL MCCARTNEYS CRITICS ARE SOMEWHAT LIKE THOSE OF ELVIS PRESLEY.EITHER YOU LIKE HIM OR HATE HIM AND THERE IS NO IN BETWEEN.EVERYONE SEEMS TO WANT TO ANALYZE EVERY LITTLE WORD THAT HE WRITES AND MISS OUT ON THE FUN OF THE MUSIC.THIS IS A GREAT CD,MAYBE EVEN HIS BEST,IT IS VERY ENJOYABLE AND MORE SO WITH EACH LISTEN.IF YOU LIKE PAUL MCCARTNEY THEN BUY IT,IF YOU DON'T LIKE HIS MUSIC THERE IS NO NEED TO ANALYZE IT."
2,This thing rocks!,"I've owned this product for almost a year now. It works just the way it should, straightening the hair effecively in a small amount of time. I've even dropped this thing on the hard tile floor of my bathroom 2 months after I bought it, which chipped the top piece of plastic on it. It stopped working because of this and it wouldn't turn on so I assumed I had broken it permanently. About a week later I turned it on just to see if I could get it working again, and low and behold, it turned on and works just as perfectly as it did the first day I used it. So in sum, it's effective, easy to use, great on the hair, and it's apparently quite durable even after a HARD fall. 5 star, recommended!"
2,Trash Can with Lid,The trash can tends to dent easily. But since I use it outdoors for trash that's OK with me. I have it for a spare can when needed. The can serves it's purpose. Packaging of this item can definitely be improved on!
2,Morgan gave this to Jake,"My daughter had to have this, then got tired of it and gave it to her cousin, who was completely thrilled to have it."
2,Insanity my elbow,"I was pointed to this stuff by a friend that told me it was hot and I would like it.Let me tell you now, your out of your mind if you think your going to use this to spice up some normal food.Only use this EXTREMELY sparingly in chili or to make Hot wing sauce.Two penny sized drops in your chili will make it the hottest thing you have EVER ate in your life.Think of eating a Habanero pepper, that's down right hot, this stuff makes a Habanero pepper seem like a pickle.For a good joke, drop a dab of this in your buddy's chew and watch him come unglued."
2,Mingus,"Just buy it, you will be glad you did. Classics Charles Mingus a must have for anyone that likes jazz"
2,Cleaner Grinder Brewer,"I was considering getting this or the much pricier Cuisinart.I'm glad I purchased this because it is one of the easiest-to-clean models on the market. The whole bean-grinding chamber can be easily removed and rinsed.My wife uses this every day and finds it far better than our previous Mr. Coffee model. (The Mr. Coffee would blow the ground coffee from the grinding chamber to the brewing chamber. Apparently, that design is bad, if you want the interior free from a coffee dust storm!) From what I've read, the Cuisinart coffee grinder/makers get messy as well.I hope longevity isn't a problem as others mentioned, but we've only owned this a month so we don't know yet."
2,Faster! A Racers Diary - Jackie Stewart / Peter Manso,"Jackie Stewart was one of the finest racers I ever had the privilege of watching. Out of 99 Grands Prix he won a staggering 27! In 1969 after only four years in F1 he won his first world championship. This book details the following year 1970, a difficult year for Stewart since he lost two very close friends to motor racing.This book recounts how Stewart was forced to re-examine and affirm his motivation and commitment to the sport, before charging back in 1971 to win his second of three world championships."
2,Very Nice,"I greatly enjoied it.A few people commented here about not liking ""The Joke"". Its one of my favorites on the CD. But then, I'm probably a little older than your average review writer here. ""The Joke"" shows direct old Cheap Trick influence. I could have easily been listenning to an old Neilsen/Zander/Peterson composition. For those of you who didn't like Cheap Trick in the 70's and early 80's (ala One on One, Dream Police, et al), this song may sound a little strange. However, I found it completely refreshing and different than anything I have heard in a long time. There guys just keep getting better."
2,A must for Photoshop 5.0,This really should be included with the program. Shame on Adobe for not including it. This book is the best and I never read manuals. It is easy to read and I didn't need the software in front of me to understand the topics. It helped that I had some time working with the software but I most often read about a tool at night and then test it the next day. It's in color which helps a lot too. By reading start to finish I learned things about Photoshop that I probably would have missed by just playing with the software. I love this book and carry it with my laptop where ever I go. The two are inseparable!
2,1:33:1 vs. 1:37:1?,"I will not review this film as I have purchased but not received it yet, however...TK RILEY's review lambasts Criterion for NOT transfering in WIDESCREEN format:1. If you look up this film at imdb.com and click on DVD DETAILS you will notice thatthe DVD is presented in ""Academy Aspect Ratio"" which translates to: 1:33:1 Aspect Ratio.2. If you look up this film at imdb.com and click on TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS you will see it was originally filmed within an aspect ratio of 1:37:13. imdb.com will state if this is ""PAN AND SCAN"" (and they do NOT!)IN FACT, here is a quote from Criterions website titled ""About the transfer"" -- M. Hulot's Holiday is presented in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1.33:1.4. CONCLUSION: How much could we be missing? Answer: NOT MUCH!Forgetta bou'dit! Purchase and enjoy!"
2,good,Its a really neat vac for small to medium sized jobs I love the fact that it is cordless which is why I got it. Its very light weight and compact. A lot of people say they can't find accessories but I have a dirt devil I got for 40 bucks for my home and its accessories are compatible with the dewalt vac.
2,Great for indoor volleyball skills practice,"My daughter is a middle school volleyball player and the weather doesn't always cooperate so that she can practice outdoors. I saw this advertised and promptly got it for her. Ours arrived as a white ball, not red as pictured, but it's just as described. She finds it particularly useful for setting and agility and I'm thrilled she's not bouncing a ""real"" volleyball against any of our doors or walls."
2,Brilliant!!,This is what will always remain as good from the musically amazing 70's. So much good music and so little time. Check this out if you value innovation.
2,Unrelenting excitement!!,"I picked this book up in an airport after the book I started on the first leg of my trip home failed to hold my attention. Granted, I was tired so it wasn't necessarily the book's fault and, in fact, now that I went back to the first book later it was actually pretty good. Just not riveting enough to keep me awake and reading.THIS book, however, kept my attention for the entire 2 hours of the second leg of my flight and I found myself speeding home from the airport so I could read more. I finally arrived at home about 11pm and finished the book at 4am. Couldn't put it down. Great writing but and even greater story.I'm not a big gambler or blackjack player but the people involved and the systems they employed to beat the house were just amazing. One of my favorites.Get the book but don't start reading until you have some time on your hands."
2,Great for inspiration,"This is a great book if you are looking for inspiration to bring to your own dishes. However, if you are simply looking for new recipes to try this would not be the best book to purchase. The recipes in this book require a great deal of culinary knowledge to create. On the positive side, this book is a great read because it contains some amazing photography coupled with high scale food. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and I would make some of the recipes for special occassions but the recipes are too costly and time consuming for everyday cooking for most people. If you are looking for inspiration and examples of creativty and innovation from a great restarant I would definately buy this book."
2,"Good, has original text","This is the text of the original book. However, it does not contain any of the photos of the original edition."
2,"original, evocative, exceptional","Like other reviewers, I was so absorbed in this book that I finished it in one day and continue to reflect on the story. Cunningham intertwines the tales of three individual women seamlessly, and concludes his book with a startling denoument. He is a beautiful writer who understands the inner workings of women. Bravo!"
2,I liked but it had a few problems,"I rated this a 4 because I thought this was a pretty good book overall. I liked the brother/sister parts. It helped to narrow down my style. BUT like a previous reviewer pointed out, the book completely fell apart. Pages just kept falling out. It was very frustrating. And I did not abuse the book, it was just from normal reading. Also, I wish she would have included meanings/origins.I would have given it a 5+ if the book was made better and included meanings."
2,A must-have for all Syphon Filter enthusiasts!,This book does its job perfectly-and then some. Shows you everything you might have missed and points you in the right direction for all those tough levels! Much better than OPM's walkthru.
2,Great Case,"The knife case works wonders, but the locking mechanism is a little tricky to get a grip on. It is hard to tell when it is locked, and the keys are practically useless. Anything that can turn the mechanism will actually open the case, so the keys are not necessary. In that regard it was disappointing, but otherwise a great case."
2,More layers than an onion!,"I've watched this movie alone, and with friends. Every time I see it I find a new depth to it. The relationships and characters involved are so deep and multi-faceted that I imagine I'll still be finding new things about it in the future. I must-see!"
2,"Black, White, and Jewish","The title of this book caught my attention.Although I am not mixed,I very well may someday have a mixed child.I found this book very interesting,the times she was growing up were the same time period I was growing up.I knew all the songs she wroteabout and all the cool clicks of kids in Riverdale she hung with.I feel like Ms.Walker could very well be a good friend of mine.I too grow up in Westchester but as a Italian American.But I feel like the ending was a disapointment,like when did she meet her ""Partner""?I want to know more!!I hope Ms.Walker blesses us with more books!Maybe a second diary of her early 20's!!???"
2,Ultimate Hose Nozzle,"This is my second Bon-Aire nozzle, my first lasted a couple years until it mysteriously dissapeared, after searching I ordered another, they both are high quality nozzles, although I'm rating the new one four stars because it is hard to turn nozzle, never had an issue with my first one. I did take apart and applied some grease which did help a little, you won't appreciate how nice these are untill you buy one from like Home Depot, I think the Bon-Aire's are much better"
2,Williams Gets Better and Better,"This is an enjoyable, well thought out, well characterized disaster book. It starts out slow, as Williams introduces the twenty-some-odd characters and locales necessary for his slice of the great American disaster, but by the end, I couldn't stop reading."
2,"Fun and Interesting, But Needs Work","From the guy before me, that happened with me. All you need is to repair your hard drive. That's what I did, and the game works fine. Overall, though, it is a good game. It's not really that exciting like Nightlife, however."
2,The way in which this book helped me,"I got scrumped through the back door by my boyfriend becuase of this book- the pictures helped me to know how to make the neccesary facial expressions that turn him on for him to see in the adjacent mirror as suggested by the book. It was facinating to learn the names of all the different positions. It was really weird, but becuase of the experience of reading this book I have a better feeling of knowing what my partner wants sexually, and that gratification allows me to perform my sexual duties much better as well. I will never forget what this book has done for me and my partner- and I would suggest it to anyone looking for assistance. The only area which I found difficult to grasp was the self stimulation subjects- because I never have really found this practice near as stimulating as the author makes it out to be."
2,Household Gods,"The main character's animosity toward men wore me out. The beginning dragged with too many meaningless details. Once she found herself in Carnuntum, however, the book captivated me and didn't release me until the end. A sequel would be welcomed, particularly if the authors managed to start it better than they did this one."
2,A Must Read For Star Wars Fans,"This is by far my favorite book out of all star wars books written to date. Not only that but it is also the only book thus far to be written in first person. This book made the main Character, Corran Horn, my favorite in the Star Wars Universe and also made the Author, Stackpole, my favorite in the star wars writing community. I have read it 5 times now and it has gotten better each time. For these reasons and many more, I suggest you pick up this book."
2,Chaka's Powerhouse Vocals!,"When this Lp came out in 1982, a Billboard ad stated 'The Most Powerful Instrument in Music Returns'....and it did! This Chaka lp is one of her best and it shows how to use Power Vocals correctly! I think this Lp was ahead of it's time...a Great fusion of R&B;, Funk & Jazz..Arif Mardin KNEW what to do with Khan's voice! 8 powerful examples of why Chaka Khan is one of the Greatest Singers ever!!I have this on vinyl & CD!!! :)"
2,One Time Use Cameras are awesome,"I try to remember to keep a spare in the closet. One time use cameras are so convenient. You don't have to worry about damaging it (at least you don't lose an expensive camera) and you can put it in your pocket. I've actually had better pictures with a ""one time"" than with my $500 Nikon. Image that! Kodak or Fuji ... should be about the same. Fuji is usually a little cheaper. Both seem to be just as good. Great to put on tables at wedding receptions!"
2,GEORGE FOREMAN GV5 CONTACT COOKER,"I REALLY LIKE AND USE IT EVERY DAY. THE ONLY COMPLAINT THAT I HAVE IS THAT WHEN THE TIMER TIMES OUT IT DOES NOT SHUT OFF, I BOUGHT A DIGITAL HEAVY DUTY TIMER FROM HOME DEPOT AND NOW THE OVEN SHUTS OFF AFTER A PRESET TIME INTERVAL. IF YOU DON'T KEEP AN EYE ON THE COOKER IT WILL ALLOW THE FOOD TO OVER COOK. MY REMEDY TO THE PROBLEM COST TWENTY DOLLARS...NOW I LOVE THE COOKER."
2,great value,I purchased this after purchasing one for my son and his wife as a holiday gift. They use it 3-4 times a week and love it! I use this for steaming veggies and rice and it works great. No complaints.
2,a grand conclusion for a classic epic,yes I read others writing that they found it shallow or unrealistic unreasonable etc...but for me I found it thrilling exciting and nail biting.I switches back to Jarad as a focal character and his bonding with an eagle which portends war. Along with another mage from a rival league. Civil war breaks out as an evil ghost takes over the power stone of the mages. In the end a curse is broken that binds the dead mages to this realm.I love the combination of technology and magecraft. High tech verses an agrigarian society. I see the writers soap box platform on saving our old growth forest. I live in the pacific north west and have experienced it a lot and agree.I look forward to his next book. I find him a fascinating writer with thoughtful insight and three deminsional characters. A real flare for style.
2,Good product. Engaging for our kids.,"It's a pretty simple toy, and it's not much of a toy for imaginative play, but our boys enjoy playing with it. I think we got our money's worth from this toy.The older one (he has an ""engineer"" personality) especially likes to examine the gears and its geometric relationship as he spins the pieces manually. He has learned to attach gears in a chain, instead of just directly to the main hub.We have a very small apartment with a very small kitchen, so it was a little difficult having them in there to play with it (and magnetic letters) on the refrigerator - we now have them play with the toy on the washer which is in the little space between the living room and the 2nd bedroom - that works well for us."
2,One of the greatest trance albums ever!,"If you liked Robert Miles ""Dreamland"" ATB's ""Addicted to music"" and any album from BT you're gonna love this. It's a true classic. I first heard them in 96 when ""Seven days and one week"" was topping all charts in Europe. ""Flash"" and ""Desire"" were both simular songs. Not all songs are like that though ""Universal flash"" ""First & Second level"" sound like opera, they are instrumental like all other songs and beautiful just the way the are. ""Freetime"" is another favorite, it has a very diffrent sound then the rest. That's one reason why i liked this. You always get surprised by the diversity of this album. The fact that all songs are very artistic and wonderful to listen to, makes this album a real classic in trance music."
2,Cuts like butter,"""Female approved"". Easy cutting, long enough handles. Wish it had a larger cut width. I'd go with a 3 inch cutting capacity in hind site."
2,"More, please","Delightful! Powerful, evocative imagery (I truly loved the cemetery scene), well-defined human and supernatural characters, and a fabulously unique plot. I can't wait to read more by this author."
2,actionman,held my interest thanks Mr. Seagal & Austin I'll be looking for either one of your movies to come out.
2,AWESOME ALBUM,"Life for rent is another awesome album by Dido. It is a bit more laid back than ""No Angel"" but in my opinion, I think that makes it better. Her soft calming vocals really suit the music. Its just great to listen to it while your driving in your car or even while your sleeping or taking a nap. Highly recommended!! A must have album for both dido fans and non dido fans. Go buy one now! hehe."
2,Uncommonly easy reading,I saw the cover of this book and picked it up not knowing anything about who these sisters were. I don't get the Satellitesisters radio show in Denver but the cover intrigued me havinggrown up in a big family myself. What I found inside was an unexpected treasure-- stories from grown-up women who have fond memories of when they were not so grown-up. This is exactly the kind of reading I love as I'm going to sleep each night. Thanks Dolans.
2,Great way to pass time,"Just reading the description, I wasn't sure this was meant for the PPC, but I took a chance and bought anyway. Turns out it works for both Palm and Pocket PC. It is great fun, and with the rebate, it is a great price. My only complaint is that the difficulty between easy and medium is a pretty big jump."
2,"""Rock and Roll the Bones""","You know what? This CD proves 3 things to me: Rush is an awesome band. Neil Peart is the best rock and roll drummer this planet has ever seen. Neil is also one of the great lyricists in rock as well. When I heard ""Dream Line"", ""Ghost of a Chance"", and ""Roll the Bones"", I was dancing all over the place. This is a great CD, and I highly recommend it!"
2,pirate ship,"the seller had this toy to me in less than 4 days wow thank you, and my son loves it thats all he can talk about and play with at this time. I would order again from them."
2,Filter set 3 piece,Purchased the 3 piece filter set for this vacuum.Bissell 35766 CleanView II Plus Upright Bagless VacuumDelivery was super quick! parts fit well. Would buy from vender again.
2,Birkenstock review 44,Great shoe. Fast shipment. They were delivered undamaged and with the Birkenstock quality you would expect.These sandles are the most comfortable to wear and will last. They form fit to the individual.
2,Timeless Classic,"I've had this desk set on my office desk for about four years now and always receive positive compliments about the classic styling - beautiful walnut wood base, clean lines, traditional, and elegant.I like that this is both a Pen and Pencil set. It's great having a choice of writing instruments. I still prefer using a pencil when making rough notes and drafts because it allows me to make a correction by erasing instead of crossing out a word or sentence. The ink pen is more permanent, but very practical as well for signing documents, letters, correspondence, etc."
2,Good to read.,This philosophy is based on Plato's Republic. It is worth to read. The writer is impudent Islamic philosopher. Book is ex++++ and inside pages are clean. Thanks.
2,Best Capo Ever!,I'll never need to buy another capo! This works great on both of my guitars and it holds down my strings very effectively.
2,Dr. Seuss' education,"It's a good lesson learned. Kids can pick up some good ideas. The cast fits their roles, especially Danny DaVito!"
2,deep meditative music,"I first heard the Gundecha Brothers live on a recent trip to India. It was at the annual music festival for Swami Vivakanada's birthday in Kolkata jan 2007. I was amazed at their amazing technique, beautiful tone and incredible sound. This recording recreates the spirit of that concert. Although recorded at a live festival in 2001, the sound quality is excellent as is the performance of this wonderful jugalbandi or duet performance. Dhrupad is one of the most ancient vocal forms of India and has it's roots in Vedic chanting, a 2000 year old tradition. Given the time needed for appreciation, this music will captivate and reward the listener with it's deeply meditative quality."
2,3 thumbs up,"Airmania is not only a must see for Michael Jordan fans. It's a superb insight into the ""culture of celebrity"" that exists in our society. Funny, poignant, and in it's own way, uplifting to see these ""superfans"" finding faith in a higher being, Michael Jordan."
2,"great for oily skin, or combination skin in the summer.","It feels moisturizing and cool going on the skin. It is the perfect moisturizer for oily skin or combination skin in the summer. I have dryer combination skin and found it to be not moisturizing enough in the dry winter month.The best part is that it is gentle enough for sensitive skin. Normal moisturizers and some eye cream burns when applied to my eyes, but this one never does that (I have applied it all over my lid and close to my lashes with no discomfort)."
2,Lifechanging,"If ever I've read a life changing book, this is it. Easy to read, easy to understand, easy to implement in your life."
2,clutch kit,this kit is for the dual mass flywheel. it only includes the clutch disk pressure plate etc. the picture is not accurate
2,Excellent. The group gets better with each CD,"I DID NOT THINK THAT IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE TO TOP THEIR PREVIOUS CD, BUT THEY DID IT. FAVORITE CUTS ARE KITTY CAT AND VINTAGE REGGAE. THE CD RATES 5 STARS. HOPE TO SEE THEM ONE DAY IN CONCERT. FANTASTIC!"
2,"CD is rad, & its awesome driving music !!!!!!","When I first heard this cd, I just wanted to jump around. This IS rad driving music, (just pay attention to your speed &the speed limit!)and not only that, Reel Big Fish is rad live. I'll never get bored of listening to this CD, never"
2,Great to replace the cheap refill that comes standard in most tactical pens.,"I have an UZI pen I like to use as a daily writing instrument. The original refill that came with the pen was really bad. This refill writes smoothly, with no pressure needed and at a wide writing angle."
2,Delightfully Creepy.,"Being a FPS (first person shooter) fan, this is a refreshing break from the norm: quite literally. It's a twisted world perspective and I loved (and am loving) every minute of it. To the makers of the movie, ""Hostel"", eat your heart out (pun intended). Tap into your dark side and join the citizens of Rapture, the setting of the game, in an epic adventure that is sure to satisfy the beast in you. Weapon upgrades, mystical powers, disturbing clown music and deranged psychos; who could ask for more? This is a must-have and is perfect for any gamers arsenal."
2,3001: The Final Frontier for Mankind,"In 3001: The Final Odyssey, Arthur C. Clarke showsus the future potential of integrating the dreamsof man with the abilities of technology. 3001holds your attention with the return of HAL andDave Bowman one thousand years after the epic2001: A Space Odyssey. Clarke once again helps usto expand our ideas about mankind and its placein the universe. Also read Clarke's The Hammer ofGod for more thought-provoking yarn about thefuture of mankind."
2,Like it better than 600watt model,"I've had the 300 watt mixer for 13 years and love it. I like the ease of the tilt-back head. This model does a great job with everything from beating egg whites to mixing up a double batch of cookie dough. I recently received the 600 model. The 600 model makes a LOT more noise, doesn't seem to reach the bottom of the bowl so creaming and whipping aren't performed as well. AND, once you've gotten used to the tilt-back design, the lift-up design seems cumbersome. It's difficult toremove the beater and you can't remove the bowl without removing the beater. I use my 300 watt most of the time because it's more user friendly. Every cook/baker should have one."
2,Fun for everyone at the same time,"We bought the dices after playing with friends on Thanksgiving... all family had a lot of fun. It's easy to play, and suitable for playing with many players!"
2,Fast quick workout,This is a pretty good workout for time crunched people. It's also very good to help get you back on the weight training track. I would like it to start up a little faster (i.e.) a little less explanation how to proceed.
2,Caged Bird,"Buy this entire album for the track, Caged Bird. I guarantee that with each bird you see, whether free or caged, your thoughts will take flight and remember Ms. Lincoln's melodic phrasings."
2,COOL,"Awsome cd...almost evry song is worth listening to...prison song,pogo,and chop suey are all realy good."
2,It gets the job done,"I decided to buy an ice cream machine last summer when my favorite ice cream parlor closed, which was the only one for miles around that sold cinnamon ice cream. (I can live without a lot of things but cinnamon ice cream isn't one of them.) I went to the housewares stores looking for the Cuisinart but they were sold out, so I bought the Krups instead. Lucky me. I took it home, popped the bowl in the freezer according to directions (for good measure I put the beater in there too), and the next day I was downing a plate of the most scrumptious cinnamon ice cream I ever ate. The machine's design could do with some improvement; it isn't very easy to get the top situated just right; and the recipe book isn't all that great. But in terms of performance, this little machine came through just fine. I'm looking forward to another summer full of cinnamon ice cream!"
2,Love it..,"Its an awesome game, bought it back when it came out never got to finish it.. glad I was able to find it. Thank you!"
2,How Could he,How could snoop be so fly after so many years in the game.this cd is amazing and all the tracks proved it.and all those haters out there posting reviews with other nicks they just hate to love snoop cuz' snoop is one of the best rappers and this cd is awsome and they can't admit it.very good work snoop.a masterpiece
2,Excellent food for all dogs,"I have used Canidae products exclusively for my dogs for many years, with great results. They have healthy shiny coats, and are active and beautiful. However, my Sheltie-Chow mix had recurring ear problems all her life. The vet couldn't identify the problem--her ears weren't infected--but they always looked red and irritated. We tried everything, but nothing really helped. One day, on a whim, I bought the new grain-free Canidae, and to my surprise her ears cleared up almost immediately. All the time we had been looking for an elusive infection, but apparently she just had a wheat allergy. To test the theory, one day I fed her a piece of bread (wheat) and the next day she was tugging at her ears. Back to the grain free Canidae! The dogs love it, and the Sheltie mix just passed her 15th birthday and is going strong."
2,Another home run horse tale!,"Once again, Farmer gives her young readers an engrossing and informative tale about the show circuit. What I like about these books is how Ms. Farmer teaches her readers about the goings-on at these events, all without sounding too boring or ""lesson-like"". She takes her audience for a roller coaster ride, keeping them enthralled the whole way with a fantastic plot and a fabulous cast of characters."
2,A rousing romantic melodrama,"Someone could make a pretty good movie of this. Tragic bereavement, determined revenge (that fails), shady characters, disguises and at the end romance and happiness. Of course, Collins was writing in the mid-1800s, and it was a serial publication, so be prepared to wade through a style that maximizes word count (at a penny each!). Nevertheless the plotting is wonderful and the struggle to outwit the villain - or even to be sure who the villain is, which takes a while - is worth the trip. If the ending is a little pat, it's well foreshadowed, if you can catch it. It's a good read."
2,Gripping Reading,This book was very gripping. Some of the stories raised the hair on the back of my neck. We should never forget what happened that awful day. More of these books with survivor stories are needed.
2,Not one of his best books,"For me this lacks the spontaneity and originality of his other novels. By his standards it is quite a conventional narrative, seems a little too carefully planned and has too much detail. However it is a well written and often compelling book. If it had been written by an unknown I'd probably have liked it better, but from Chatwin I had hoped for a bit more. Perhaps I was spoilt by the genius of all his other fiction (and faction) and expected too much from this one. He draws some beautiful pictures of the landscape - which is an important character in the novel. As ever, he has a great sense of place."
2,How to REALLY learn Java ....,"Buy this book!I bought several copies for my staff, many of whom are mainframe/COBOL programmers. Even after Sun training, many of them were still struggling with Objects and the Java class libraries.This was the book that turned on the light for most of them."
2,Extremly Funny!!!!!!!!,"I like this one MUCH better than the remake! Although the remake was still good. It is MUCH closer to the book. It was also more funny and I thought that Jodie Foster did an excellent job as Annabel! MUCH better than Lindsey Lohan. I also thought that Barbara Harris did a great job as Ellen. The Remake is not close to the book at all. After you see the orginal one, you'll probaly think that the remake isn't as good!"
2,Bang for Your Buck,I've had these lamps for a few years now and they are holding up well. The look expensive and I get many compliments on them. If you like this style of lamp ... these are a great bargain.
2,My everyday scent,"I bought this blind after reading the reviews here and on basenotes. If I had tried this in a store I would never have bought it, the first whiff is almost unpleasantly herbal. In fact, for the first twenty minutes you will smell like something that crawled out of the spice cabinet. But it dries down to a nice, refreshing, clean springtime scent. Longevity is great, and over the course of the day as you get hot and work up a sweat you will get nice hits of vetiver wafting up to calm you down. This is not a scent that will bring the opposite sex trampling each other to get at you, this is something you will wear to smell good for yourself.The closest to a compliment I got from this cologne was from a customer who walked into my store. He looked around, sniffing, and said ""It smells good in here. (more sniffing) Like a good smoked gouda!"" Huh?"
2,In a classic really-English accent so un-Australian,"This romantic film is a visualized story of the greatest male dancer of the twentieth century, written by Waslaw Nijinsky about Waslaw Nijinsky. Gently touching different biographic aspects of a bi-sexual dancing genius, a feature is presented as a sexually-charged music-rich pantomime softly unveiling a context by both nude and specially-dressed-up characters deployed, a text reading in a classic really-English accent so un-Australian.It is a real both visual and vocal pleasure so rare for Australian produces."
2,THIS IS IT THE TRUELY GREAT THING!,"Another lovely album full of spunk. I can never say enough about the greatness of Sebadoh. Just when your ready to smash your head into the wall, a beautiful love song begins. Bravo!"
2,Nice for little ones,My daughter liked pulling out all of the surprises inside the elephant. Not very educational but fun and very durable.
2,Great British series,i HAVE HAVE WATCHED MANY VERSIONS OF NICHOLAS NICKLEBY AND THIS IS NEAR THE TOP.I DO PREFER THE JAMES D'ARCY VERSION.IF A FILM IS TAKEN FROM GREAT LITERATURE AND WELL DIRECTED-FILMED-AND COSTUMEDIS NICE TO MAKE COMPARISONS AND WATCH THEM ALL
2,Vital car safety equipment,"As seen tested on Mythbusters! This compact, inexpensive tool can save lives by helping you escape a car during a wreck if you can't release the seat belt latch or get the window down. It has a safety blade (cutting edge only on the inside of a hook)to cut seat belt webbing and a pointed hammerhead that will easily shatter a car window even when you can't break it without a tool. It's day-glow orange for easy visibility, is compact enough to fit in a glovebox or dash console and comes with a mounting bracket in case you want to put it somewhere else in your vehicle for easy access. I bought one for each of our vehicles."
2,Amazingly Catchy Indie Pop,"Sunday's Best is an excellent band that has been around for awhile but has gotten very little attention..until now that is. Their previous CDEP on Crank was mediocre (in my opinion), but with ""Poised to Break"" they guys have really struck a chord with me. The cd is ultra-catchy with more hooks then a pile of dead fish, and amazingly infectious melodies. When you get tired of a lot of the average boring indie/emo (for lack of a better term..I'm sorry..really I am) like the GUK and TPR make sure to pick up this little gem..I'm quite sure it will be glued in your cd player for a long time."
2,Great pants.,"Fantastic pants. I have three pairs and want more.Sizing: Order up a size, they run VERY small.Maintenance: A pair shrunk on me, so I line dry them now."
2,Everything Scrabble,"Everything ScrabbleI bought this as a gift. So the only rating I can give is that it was delivered expeditiously, and was in great condition. As for content, when the gift is opened I will tell you more."
2,Great Shape & Fast,The book was exactly how they described it. Its in great shape. It was sent quickly.
2,A Sharon Creech Review,"The book I'm reviewing is called Granny Torrelli Makes Soup by Sharon Creech. I gave this book four stars because it is sad. This is a good book, but not my favorite. The book is about a girl and her grandma having good times and bad times with friends. The grandma came to America and left her friend, Pardo, behind. Her friend's dog gets tied to the railroad track. Pardo tries to get the dog untied but gets run over by the train. I would recommend this book to some of my friends.

2,"Beware, this is not ""Godfather Trilogy""","This movie is great however do not confuse this DVD with the Godfather Trilogy. This film is not in chronological order as in the Godfather Trilogy. Trilogy is only available in VHS at this time.GodFather is great, the actors, storyline.I was thoroughly entertained however I will buy the chronological Trilogy version for it's completeness. Enjoy."
2,Small and convenient,"The size of the product make it convenient. The communication is clear. After a while, I have headache using it!"
2,Makes even men cry,"This movie is ones of those like White Christmas. A classic in its own way. The story is so involved with 2 people in the same place at a different time trying to get together when they already have in the past or is it the future? You decide! Guess you will just have to buy this one to find out. I Laughed, I cried, it touched my heart. A must have for the Holidays or any time you just want to sit down and watch a really really great movie. I actually have 2 copies just in case i wear one out!"
2,Extremely enjoyable,"The Bottom Line:Something of a cross between a standard sports film and The Road Warrior, The Blood of Heroes is a supremely entertaining little Australian film from the 80s; if that description sounds like it's up your alley, don't hestitate to rent it and learn about the awesome blood sport of jugging!3/4"
2,Tear jerker to the highest deegree!!,"I would very much like to thank you mr Hefler for waiting as long as you did. So that I and others like me could read your book! I went to the libray to get another book, got Modoc instead, and never looked back! Read this book if you never do again."
2,Tunes to Kickback To,"This CD is simply great. Jack Johnson is the most accomplished surfer/musician ever. If you like Ben Harper, get this album. Harper even makes an appearance on the album playing the slide guitar. This is a top-notch product."
2,DIY Adoption Guide,"This product met ALL of my expectations. At first, it was a little difficult to use, but that's my own fault. The examples were especially helpful, as were the readily filled out forms."
2,The best,"Exactly what you would expect from such a great and accomplished organist.Thankfully, the grand organ is my favourite instrument."
2,Roots of Fantasy Fiction,"This is more for those who are interested in the history and drama of the battles a lost people than magical rings or wizardry. Morris gives fantastic descriptions of his locales and the action in this novel and the prequel (The House of the Wolfings) is vibrant with energy. The two stories are basically about the cross purposes of love and loyalty. The novel can be confusing to keep track of the characters as at various points the same character will be referred to with a different name. Overall I think it is a thrilling adventure which stands on its own, not only as a foundation stone for further creations in the medium."
2,"Very, very sweet. Nice ears, too!","It's hard to get away with wearing bunny slippers when you're an adult, but on babies they sure are cute! This set is a good gift risk, in case the baby already has 6,000 copies of Goodnight Moon."
2,Walk on Water (2005),An outstanding film of gay interest. Definately in the high quality class. Some moments of tenderness are so wonderful as to bring tears to the eyes. A really classy film for those of us who are romantics!
2,Frances Parkinson-Keyes at Beauregard House,"We recently vacationed in New Orleans and upon reading about the Keyes-Beauregard House near Jackson Square, we went there for a tour. This house is where Mrs Keyes lived for many years and wrote many of her books in the former slave quarters behind the house. She has a very interesting life and we were impressed with this short book on her life written by one of her closest friends, Pen Hogan. It is a very easy read and even more interesting if you've been to this house where she lived on Chartres St in the French Quarter of New Orleans. Since reading this book, we've also purchased another of her works titled ""The River Road"" which is about Plantation life in Louisiana."
2,It doesn't get any better,"This is by far, the bible for segmented turning. I constantly refer to it to get ideas for new projects and hone my techniques. Even after several years of creating segmented bowls, I keep coming back to it for sound advice. Through experimentation, I developed a number of techniques for producing segmented bowls. But surprisingly, every single one of those techniques are described in this book. If I were to start over, this would be my single reference. Worth every penny."
2,Santa Ornament,"This was a gift from my sister for my all Santa Christmas tree. Packaging was great, item itself very nice. Very detailed."
2,Amazing!,Really loved it. The dialogues and action sequences and story. I hope they're making a second part for this series.
2,Magnificent!,"This is the classic, perfect presentation of scale, presenting both a realistic picture of the wide variations in the Universe and our own nearly random place in it. I first came across this film (actually it was the ""rough sketch"" version) at the Ontario Science Center in the 1970s. I must have sat through the film loop at OSC a dozen times. I never tire of it."
2,Works great,"For the price, this is the best ice cream scoop I've ever used. Cleans up great and slices through ice cream without any problems. Highly recommended"
2,Isn't This Cover Awesome?,"This is a collection of over thirty of Elton John's greatest hits from 1970-2002, including Tiny Dancer, Crocodile Rock, Bennie and the Jets, Candle in the Wind, and Circle of Life, which are my favorites. Actually, these are the only songs I know by him, so I may not be the most reliable source of information about this book. The sheet music is a bit awkward in my opinion, meaning it is difficult to pick up the ""feel"" of the song the way it is written. The chords seem to be accurate, though, so if you already know the song you can basically figure it out. And, as other reviewers have commented, the cover on this book is awesome!"
2,Very handy wipes for lazy me.,"These are the greatest for cleaning make-up off the face before bed. Not only do they clean well, getting off mascara and blush beautifully, but they also moisturize. And it's so much handier to use one of these wipes than it is to wash off the face in the sink, where I always manage to wet my hair when I don't want to. The only issue I have with the purchase online is that buying one packet here, you're paying almost as much again in shipping as the cost of the packet. Either buy from Target or Walmart, where the price is just under $6, or order the 3-pack setOlay Regenerist Micro-Exfoliating Wet Cleansing Cloths, 30 Count (Pack of 3). That's the better deal."
2,amazing product,Great product and color. I received many complements on this color form people I saw at work as well as when I was getting my nails done.
2,Even more scary after 9-11,How could we allow air rage to continue as it did before 9-11? Someone on the Independent Commission investigating 9-11 should read this book. That is the real outrage!!!
2,No problems.,I have had no problems with this camera even though I have Windows XP. The software loaded in 3 minutes and as soon as the batteries were charged I was off taking pictures.Printed excellent quality on 8 X 10 Kodak premium photo paper. I did have to read the manual set-up but everything went according to the book. I'm receiving a free battery and charger with case with promo deal.Excellent purchase for my first didgital experience.
2,Breathtaking,"I love the movie, it was wonderful. I deal alot with horses and think that alot of the things Robert Redford(Tom) was true. I hope that you enjoy it as much as I did."
2,Nothing like Montblanc,Don't waste money on generic refills for your Mont Blanc unless you don't mind having to change them all the time. These refills are the way to go.
2,love this show,Great show even if your not into fantasy ball. I am though so it is that much funnier. even the wife like it
2,1st Person Narrative Really Gets You In Evan's Head,"I really enjoyed the 1st person narrative that the author uses to tell his story. A ""coming of age"" novel in which gay men can relate. Evan longs for love while finding only sex. The sex satisfies his hormones, yet he wants more... he wants normalcy. There's a clear under current hear that his orientation has developed from his enstranged relationship with his father. The characters are well drawn. Some of Evan's fantasies are hard to grasp and relate with in context to the story line. All in all, beautifully written."
2,Good Tool,"My daughter was really into Dora when we started potty training so when she started to resist the potty we decided to order this andDora's Potty Book (Dora the Explorer). I really like that this chart breaks down all the steps in going potty so I could reward my daughter for accomplishing even one step. After she filled one area quickly we just focused on actually gong in the potty and flushing. It would be nice if the chart had more spaces, but I just doubled stickers or added some little stickers form the dollar store."
2,A Lorrie Moore book is a treasure,"Lorrie Moore has an unmatched ability to mix verbal jokes and funny moments with tragic ones. She makes it look easy, but the craftmanship inherent in her work is quite complicated. She makes her readers feel her characters with their hearts and their minds. You'll laugh out loud and you feel lingering sadness.My favorite story in the collection is ""Places to Look for your Mind."" I couldn't stop thinking about it, the characters were so real to me.This whole book is a pleasure."
2,Good intro to celtic music,"A pretty good book with some interesting songs. Songs range from simple to complex. Alot of the tunes are in 6/8 time. My only negative is the CD, the mandolin is played solo. Even tho there are guitar chords on the sheet music, I wish both instruments would have been recored, I think it would have made this a perfect book."
2,what i think of one flew over the cockoo's nest,well i think that one flew over the cockoo's nest is a great movie that points out the importance of abnormality in todays society
2,can't 'can't take my eyes off of you!',"I really like this soundtrack. Likely because i don't own a whole lot of this type of music [yet]. Like many i would have replaced clintons song with 'can't take my eyes off of you' sung by heath.....and i recall some other songs i really enjoyed in the movie that aren't on the soundtrack. I agree, they ought to put out another CD. I guarantee we would buy it if it had some joan jett, bnl, cant take my eyes off of you....and even better if it had stiles reciting her poem. Hmm...all this wishful thinking is making me sad. otherwise, and awesome soundtrack....definitely eclectic and interesting....."
2,Pleased Customer,I'm amazingly happy with this product. With the insanely high prices of textbooks on college campuses it is nice to be able to save money and also get the textbooks quickly. I'm completely satisfied with this seller.
2,a fascinating medieval life recreation,"This is the best book I have purchased on this site so far. It has in plenty what I appreciate most in historical novels - realism of depicting. The epoch - violent and passionate - comes to life so that you will be re-reading this book to savour every detail once more. The people look, talk and behave as they probably would have been in the 12th century. They are loving and caring, cruel and merciless, aspiring and constantly warring. The violence, filth, blind devotion or unacceptable, to ""modern"" times, customs and concepts, is what makes the book different. I have bought 2 more books of the same author afterwards."
2,Great collection,"This is a great collection of their songs. I don't own any other of their discs, so this one had a lot of their work that I liked on one disc."
2,Fun! Fun! Fun!,"This movie was nothing but pure fun! If you're looking for a zombie film of Romero's type, don't buy this one. This video looked like it was done by a bunch of amateurs who wanted to do nothing but have fun, and in that they succeeded. The actors were not professionals, but they played their parts with honesty and effort. Don't look for hidden agendas or social statements-they're not here. Just relax, put the video in, clear your mind and enjoy! I gave the movie 4 stars for honesty, sincerity, effort, and fun factor. Only a tiny bit of gore that you don't really see, but more gore wasn't needed to help the story. Not of the caliber of ""Independence Day"", or ""Day After Tomorrow"", but more entertaining because of its light tone. Definitely one to watch over again."
2,Great Bag,PROS:+ Sized for gym lockers.+ Fits everything.+ No gripes.+ Good-to-go.IMPROVEMENTS:~ Could have a couple more compartments on the sides.
2,Buffet buddy.,These Pyrex 'casserole caddies' are the best thing that ever happened to carry-out buffet dishes. After years of church dinners the wife's hot pack sprung a leak. It was great to find an OEM replacement available here at AMAZON at a reasonable price. We ordered two so she would have a backup.
2,Deliciously Dark,"This is truly one of the first masterful thrillers and an incredible psychological examination. Foiled before he can pull the trigger and bring down a vicious European dictator, the main character is captured, tortured, and exacts a harrowing escape. The description of his wounds and the calm demeanor he exacts to flee speak to his strength and commitment to a hidden motivation. Back in his home country he is forced to ""go to ground"" literally and figuratively. This sets up a fascinating part of the book dealing with his ""hide"" and a confrontation with enemy agents that makes the pages turn with speed. A very impressive novel that resolves itself with cunning like the hunter it portrays."
2,"Dora,Rhymes&RiddlesVHS",The vhs was way beyond what i expected it to be. I will recommened Amazon to everyone. I had looked other places & nothing compared to your prices & quality.
2,reply to user looking for run for the sun,Wasn't 'Run for the sun' the hit for Bucks Fizz and not The Rah Band?
2,Now I know more about Laura than I do about my own sister!,"I very much enjoyed this thoroughly researched biography. From her grandparents and parents through her youth and then through a intricate tour of each of her recordings, this journey through the life of the fascinating Laura Nyro was a very enjoyable read. I was a child of the 60's, but I had only a casual interest in Nyro's music. After starting the book, I bought a CD and played it as background music as I read. Now I have begun to appreciate the uniqueness of this woman and understand why she has become a worshipful figure to so many people. I have never read a biography of a musician was presented so clearly and so free of sensationalim. I would recommend this to anyone who seeks to understand one of the major influences on modern music."
2,A serious trader should reread this book every 3 months.,"The best book I've read on trading, and I've read a few. There's a lesson on every page. I started to highlight, with a yellow marker,the good points in this book, but the whole book would have been yellow when I finished. I reread it every three months!"
2,THIS IS BETTER THAT I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE,IVE LISTENED TO THIS CD AND IT REALLY SURPRISED ME. LYRICALLY HE IS UP THERE WITH A LOT OF 2nd AND 3rd ALBUM RAPPERS. HIS RHYMES WITH DRE'S BEATS ARE A TIGHT COMBO!!
2,One of the best comic books of all time.,"I keep coming back to this extraordinary story by Warren Ellis and John Cassaday. It's the ultimate post-modern comic -- basically a deconstruction of the great superhero mythology that came before it.The series starts out with solid, almost self-contained stories, but soon it becomes obvious that Ellis is building to some grander story arc. In later issues, he continually shocks the reader with scenarios that are just plain fun to read, but also speak to his overall goal (reexamining the conventions that make superhero comics work). Or something like that.Either way, Planetary is smart and hard-hitting. Too bad the final issue still hasn't come out after 2 years."
2,"genuine, hilarious, tragic, hopeful","real life american story of a lost child who was swept up in the compelling 1960's. dallas taylor's honest, revealing story tells what it was like to be a part of history - to experience the tragic/ comical reality of sex, drugs and rock 'n roll -- to suffer and battle his personal daemons and to survive drug addiction and an organ transplant. God Bless Dallas Taylor."
2,Well-crafted and disturbing movie...,"The Last House on the Left was not quite what I would classify as a horror movie, but it is quite interesting, nonetheless. There are a few graphically violent scenes, but they were comically balanced out by a pair of inept policemen tracking the attackers.The dialogue is fairly realistic, and Sandra Cassel and Lucy Grantham play a pair of engaging best friends on their way to a concert by their favorite band, Bloodlust. When they try to buy some marijuana from a guy on the street, they end up in a nightmare that ultimately leads back to the house of one of the girls.The scariest part of the movie is the simple fact that what goes on in this movie (the girls being attacked moreso than the revenge) could so easily happen in real life. This movie is not for anyone bothered by torture or brutality."
2,This is why Kelly Won,Awesome cd. Well worth the wait. Nice mix of ballads and rock. Great duet on rocking song with fellow Idol Tamyra Gray. This is one cd you will want to keep in rotation on your player
2,This is the correct adapeter for many ford applications: here's some cross reference info:,"I had quite a bit of trouble finding the exact information for what adapter would fit my 2002 Ford f-150 4.6 (Windsor) engine. According to Ford (and my VIN) my correct oil filter is a MOTORCRAFT FL-820S. Unless I am mistaken,this is the correct remote/bypass filter adapter which replaces/cross-references to Mopac part number FL-820S, with 22mm x 1.5mm threads, Height = 3.98"", Dia = 3.66""For further cross reference information for this filter adaptor, please see Fram's online cross-reference guide:[..]Good luck with your projects!"
2,Great TV - HORRIBLE SHIPPING!,"This is a really nice tv, great picture and I don't think the sound is bad like I've read in other reviews. BUT if you ship through EAGLE beware! They do not have their act together, they sent me the wrong tv and I had to go crazy to resolve the problem."
2,Great product for your creative child.,This is a wonderful product for kids and adults. I bought some for my son who is 6 to make. Thought they would be great keepsakes items for when Im old and grey. He is making one for his Dad for Fathers Day which is all about the things he does with Dad. I highly reccomend these as gifts or as keepsakes. What child wouldnt want to have a book he wrote and illustrated? Great price too. Dont forget grandma and grandpa. You can do them as a family project also. Be creative.
2,Thirst,"The stories are humbling and pure. At times, I whispered, "" No, he is not going there."", but before I knew it, he had already taken me."
2,Excellent,"This is a great overview of succession planning for family businesses. Not only did I enjoy reading it, I give copies to family business owners, their family members, and/or their employees who are struggling with this issue. I highly recommend it!!!"
2,Sweet & Simple,What a delightful book! My toddler can easily understand the importance of prayer as emphasized in this Bible story. Darling pictures.
2,"Very Challenging, Wonderful Workout",I am new at yoga so this was a real challenge for me. But it was the best low impact aerobic excercise routine I have ever done. I loved it and felt wonderful afterwords. I was actually relaxed. I highly reccomend this video for people that have a stressful day and need to unwind. I look forward to doing this video any time I have a chance.
2,Disturbing but not surpising.,Heard the author on radio broadcast (Coast to Coast)and knew I had to have it. Quite a conversation piece...and I am looking over my shoulder a lot.
2,harley valance,it complete the the certain package it would be nice if the offered it in a 42-by-15-inch so that you could use it an asmaller window
2,"Cute, catchy and great for tiring out energetic little ones","I checked this video out of the library for my six year step-son. He absolutely loved it and I got into it myself. He is really interested in being involved in my workouts and this was a neat way to involve him with risking major injuries. So we did it together and like the previous reviewer , the songs will linger in your head, but I have had worse. My only complaint was with the structure of the video. I just wish it were more structured. It bounced around to much for my taste. But who cares what I think anyway! My step son loved it enough that I am buying it."
2,A turntable of excellent value!,"I bought this turntable several years ago and this is a turntable of excellent value! Never had any problems with it whatsoever. The only thing that keeps this turntable a rating of 5 or more is the design....it is FULLY MANUAL and so when the record is finished playing you have to lift the needle up yourself;therefore, it would have been better if it were at least semi-automatic, huh? Following the instructions in the manual is satisfactory in termsof adjusting the correct tonearm weight via the counter weight device...I had to experiment awhile until I found the best weight...but, when I found it, it was HEAVEN!The cartridge or needle that went with the turntable is good - noticed a great projection is sound. My final thought is this: if you have a great receiver and great speakers, this turntable will be a great add-on feature.Also, the price is right and also...THIS IS A SONY - A GREAT NAME YOU CAN TRUST! -John, Southern California."
2,Perfect for storaging,"Does what it says. Compatible with the Medela pumps.I also have the 150ml ones, but I freeze breast milk in these, because it is suggested to freeze in smaller portion, so a) you can thaw smaller amount if only a small amount is needed; b) even if you need to thaw 4 oz, two 2-oz bottles thaw faster than one 4-oz bottle."
2,I LOVED IT!!!,"I am so glad that I didnt listen to some of the reviews of this book that said that Rachel Gibson's LOLA was not as good as her others . I was very impressed with the way the characters grew to love each other while going through some very scary situations. The heroine Lola was a very real and honest character. She had serious issues and had realistic emotions when it came to her life and her experiences. I found Max our hero to be one of the most real characters Ive seen in a romance book for a long time. He was funny, charismatic, sexy as hell and had hangups as well. The plot was fun and exciting, the relationship that both Lola and Max has with Lola's dog Baby Doll was funny.If you are in the mood for a funny, sexy and light read this book is for you..."
2,The dangers of loyalty,"Made just about twenty years after the end of WWII, this samurai drama is a provocative cautionary tale about the way a code of honor based on fealty to military leaders can be manipulated by the unscrupulous men at the top. Eager for reform, Gennosuke (Hira Mikijiro) , a rank and file samurai, is urged to assassinate a high-ranking minister, then forced to go on the run after his patron disavows knowledge of his actions. Pursued by the daughter of the slain man, he vows to live selfishly like a ""beast"" until he encounters another samurai, Yamane (Kato Go), who is working a secret gold mine with his young wife. Recognizing that this couple is also being used, he tries to make them aware of their peril.Gosha Hideo's brief drama is a solid film with good action, fine acting, and an interesting message that shows Japan struggling with its militaristic heritage."
2,loooove this mat!!,"Being a hard core yoga student, ( i practise for an hour everyday) I've had a number of yoga mats over the years but never one as good as this. Though the cost makes one pause before hitting the order button it simply blows you away once you start using it.Those who do ashtanga will enjoy the stability of the mat.It does not bunch up under you :)I have friends who have been using it for years now and swear by it! Yes, it does slip initially but a quick cleaning with mild soap and water took care of it before first using it. It gives you a sense of being firmly grounded, doesn't slip and best of all does not even leave indentations from your toes :))The length is comfortable for taller individuals.It comes with a lifetime warranty as well. I am definitely going to have many more hours of enjoyable practice on this mat.A note of caution, it's much heavier than the previous mats i've used so it would be a lot harder to carry it for several blocks to a class."
2,Great Customer Service,"I am new to saxophone and bought the LJ Hutchen Eb Alto Saxophone from the seller because I see all the reviews from previous customers are very good. So far I have very good experience with the seller and the instrument arrived on time as expected. If anyone decides to buy this sax, you might want to check it out on the ebay. The same seller(Hyson Music) has its store on ebay selling it at price of $369.95 with free shipping and free accessories. You will end up pay less and get more. I hope the seller will send me the accessories they offer at ebay."
2,WIsdom and Wit,"If you have ever wondered what is going on in mid-life, middle America, mid- USA, or even if you haven't you must read this.There is sociological, spiritual, psychological revelation going on.. THe author takes the reader on the Great Adventure with wisdom and wit.Dont miss this one."
2,Good for the price,"I purchased this because my laptop was overheating and shutting down on me. This cooling pad has enabled me to use the laptop for longer periods of time and no more surprise shut downs. It is more solid than other more expensive cooling pads that I have seen.The only issue that I have is that the flip out leg on the cooling pad doesn't lock into place, so it have folded up on me causing the laptop to suddenly drop down a little. It hasn't caused any damage, but it is startling and worrisome."
2,just give the girl a break!!,"she is a wonderful, talanted girl,and i love her!i am Englishmy name is VernaI live in Londonmy house adress is 4321 cappington street, if you want to come to visit me something!"
2,Easy to use book from a great seller,"Book is comprehensive without being overwhelming. It is easy to reference. Seller shipped product quickly, good condition."
2,Iron Sabbath?,"Well i just can say one thing! That is not a movie it is a documentary of the British Rock legend Spinal Tap. If you consider it as a movie it is not funny at all, but if you look at it as a rockumentary than it is the funniest thing i ve ever seen. It is full of satire of distinct metal bands such as Iron Maiden (I think it is the biggest influence for Tap) , Black Sabbath , Dio , Rolling Stones ... It is a must see for a rock or metal fan..."
2,Persistent questions ...,"How is it that all this material could just be published in a book? Are these not some of the biggest secrets in human history, and wasn't it all classified? Why would it be classified no longer, or, if not, why wouldn't the government have prevented publication? Is there an explanation of this in the book? I have looked and perhaps have missed it?It's an enjoyable read, but I can't help wondering."
2,Amazing artist!,"Amazing CD, Chris Brann has established himself as being one of a kind! I highly recommend buying any, and all, of his material (also found under Wamdue Kids)."
2,Best bedtime book!,"We received this book when my daughter was 13 months old and it has been part of our nightly routine ever since. The book has a wonderful, soothing rhythm and eye-catching graphics that keep my daughter's undivided attention. By now, I have it memorized and helps me read it even when the light is off. If my daughter wakes up in the middle of the night, I can recite this book and put her back down without problems. Also, this book has been a blessing when we are visiting out of town. (Makes her feel more comfortable before bed.) This book has my highest recommendation!"
2,Good beef jerky,"These are wonderful beef jerky. I love the sweet flavor of the beef but it is not as spicy as I thought it would be. When compared to Jack Link's Hot & Spicy Beef Sticks, these are not spicy at all. To me, they are a little bit mild. This is coming from someone who does not handle spicy food very well. Although not as spicy, there is a lot of flavors."
2,"Great book, but wrong author","Amazon lists Anthony Cirone as the author of this excellent little reference book. Actually, despite Cirone's valuable contributions, the principal author is Russ Girsberger, until early 2006 the ensemble librarian of the New England Conservatory in Boston.I own a lot of percussion reference books, but this is the one I always reach for first. It's hard to beat.David Daniels"
2,recommended it to all my friends,"It's a great product, sturdy and yet compact enough to carry around. My daughter loves this potty and this says it all... It's comfortable to use, and of course it doesn't compare with all the germy public toilets :)Everyone who saw it admired it, and I recommended it to all my friends with toddlers. we've had it for almost 3 months, and we usually keep it in the car. However, if you have to carry it around, no one will be the wisest because of the nice, sporty bag it comes with - only downside - bag could have some bigger pockets for whatever you may need to carry around (like spare clothes...)Oh, and I don't know why people would pay $[...] for the colored one, when the gray is only $[...]..."
2,Graphics and story make this a wonderful book!!!,"I purchased this book after working several puzzles depicting Christensen's graphics. My daughter grabbed this book and wouldn't close it until she finished it (get a 13-year old to do that on a frequent basis!!). I'm now addicted to Christensen and recommend this book for adults and kids alike. Christensen, Graeme Base & Daniel Merriam take you places you wish to be with whimsy, wit & a little tongue-in-cheek. You'll love this artist."
2,Rail Lines of Northern NewEngland,The Rail Lines of Northern New England by Robert M. Lindsell is part of a valuable set of three books published by Branch Line Press about the railroads of New England. I strongly suggest that you buy all of these. The other two books are the Rail Lines of Southern New England by Ronald Dale Karr (the owner of these publications) and Lost Railroads of New England by R. D. Karr. These three books are scholarly and thorough and a must for railroad enthusiasts of this region.
2,train lover,i bought this book for my sons 2ry birthday he just turned three and he still loves this book and its one of his favorites on our book shelf i am more than happy with this purchase.
2,Go Chris Santilli,"Fortunately, I am lucky enough to have Chris as my ENGLISH professor at Elmhurst College this semester!! The book is a must for traveling to Jamaica's famed resort. Chris is the best."
2,Good book,"Not as good as Elminster or Drizz't but The Rogues series is good. They do NOT, however, have any real relationship to each other, so do not need to be read in any particular order."
2,Axis and Allies PC Game Review,"Great game!Easy to play with many options for single play. Online play steps it up a notch to test your skills. A great classic for any age that enjoy's this type of game.Highly recommend!You will find thru various internet searches that this game has a huge following, not only on the PC version but on the board game."
2,Obscenely original,"I stumbled on this record because of the obscure and kind of brilliant operation called Rag and Bone Shop, and discovered another obscure and brilliant little nugget with this one. (I'm also pretty sure this is the guy who was the drummer on John Linnell's solo record, State Songs.) Donato's voice is a cross between Rick Danko and someone else from the sixties whose name escapes me now. The words are weird and heartbreaking. The melodies are kind of indescribable, but make me think a little of Elliott Smith and Elvis Costello. ""Biohazard"" is ridiculously catchy and if people actually had taste out there, would be an instant hit. Another song, ""My Purple Heart"" seems to be about impotence and is kind of hilarious and terrifying at the same time. I'm already waiting for this guy to come to Chapel Hill sometime soon, but I wonder if he has the money to tour."
2,The Runelords,"WOW....on a level of Terry Brooks and the Shannara series, and R.A.Salvatores Dark Elf. I loved this book. It mixes conventional fantasy with a little of the real day things. I loved introduction of a new world so new and real that you thought you were there. A keeper and one for the mantle."
2,the ultimate first wingbook out there,"bought this at the international wing festival, which adopted the book as its official festival book..has contest winner recipes in it, recipes from around the nation and some nice side dishes and dips...even endorsed by franks redhot.This is a fun book..i will buy some for christmas for my friends..ps...easy recipes."
2,I LOVE this machine!!!,After much research I choose this machine and could not be happier. I was initially concerned since it is a bottom priced pump maker but it is a giant step up from a steam espresso maker. I will never go back. I would recommend this maker to anyone.
2,Where's the next Clemente?,"If you take the time to sit and read this marvelous piece of work, you'll find out that yes, Roberto Clemente was a tremendous baseball player, an all-around athlete with superior skills.However, what stands out isn't his many and outstanding baseball accomplishments.Roberto Clemente will be remebered has a world-class human being.A person who went out of his way to give generously his time to sick childrens. An individual who cared more about happiness and well being than about money.A shining star who was willing to give his very life in support ofstrangers who needed help.Roberto Clemente was all that. Is the next Roberto Clemente born?"
2,2006 F-150,"I bought this for my 2006 F-150 XLT. It's very easy to change out, very easy to install and I mean come on people, I can't comment on an increase in horsepower or MPG because it's quite difficult to measure without actual DYNO machines. I won't have to buy another one for the time that I have my truck and that was my intention, sweet."
2,how could i resist?,"i've been a fan of Mamma Mia! since the first time i heard Siobhan McCarthy sing ""Slipping Through My Fingers"". this album never fails to cheer me up when i'm down, and with the dvd bonus, you can't ask for more.well actually, i could... i wish the DVD featured the original London cast, but hey, beggars can't be choosers can't they?"
2,Connolly at his usual morbid best,John Connolly pulls no punches when it comes to crimes that veer towards the dark side of humanity with a lightning rod in Charlie Parker. Always a great engaging read.
2,Absolute must read,"When I first heard of the 9/11 Commission Report, I thought it would be a long, dull read. I was completely wrong... This 567 page report is a fascinating piece of work that reads much like a novel. I couldn't put it down...I definitely recommend reading this bipartisan account of the facts, especially in these times where disinformation from both sides seems to be the norm."
2,Mini Cooper cover,"the mini cooper cover is very durable, easy to put on & take off. It fits perfectly & is very elegant."
2,Lots of laughs at a boys mischief while growing up.,My mother was given this book in the 1920's and she passed it on to my brothers and me. We read it many times while growing up. It was still in print about 15 years ago so I bought copies for my children. They also loved it even though it was from another era. What a fun read. You will laugh out loud.
2,Get your Afrique on freak!,"Serendipity! I thought this was Derek Smith British Jazz pianist! And I like the word ""montuno"" as it was the bridge section of mambo music developed by the great Lopez brothers in Cuba [Cachao the bassist and Israel the pianist]. Pan can mean ""bread"" or it can mean universal. My happy surprise is that this Derek Smith is a young, hip, multi-talented writer and musician in California. Usinf steel pans the equisite jazz players take you on a musical, hip shakin' tour from de reagge mahn in Jamaica my bro round bout Mozambique with stops in Cal Tjader mambo land of San Francisco bay people. World class world music keep me smilin' bro."
2,Not as delicious as some other Trollops',A humorous and wise exploration of human values and ethics with a jaundiced look at members of the Clergy in this nineteenth century novel.Some of the characters are memorable. Trollop's use of surnames is funny and telling -- as John Bold surely was!Always a delight to get into the world of this widely read and appreciated writer.
2,One of my favorites,"This is a fabulous book. If you like ""The House At Riverton Place"" or ""The Forgotten Garden"", you'll love this book."
2,The Good ol Boys have returned,"I saw this relased, and of course it is a must have if this was your favorite show. I will say this is worth every penny paid, even if it is filmed in southren California, but so what. The episodes are clean as can be, and the show itself is as funny as the first season was. I even enjoyed the extras that were put in the package, especailly the 25th anniversary Dukefest. Bring out the third season i say."
2,great stufff,"I originally ordered this from my dentist for $400 that included 4 tubes and my own tray that was made there. I used it for a week and the dentist recommended 2 hours for 1 week. I got great results and I would recommend this product. I do experience some sensitivity to the teeth while product is on teeth but its nothing major. Teeth are noticeably white! When I'm done with my tubes, I will definitely be ordering some more online. Also, dentist recommended doing the process over every 6 months. Good luck!!"
2,What a great book!,"this book is amazingly helpful. i was a new owner of a Mexican Redknee and had NO CLUE how to handle her! she was so sweet, but i was just too afraid to handle her. then i found this book. Princess now has 2 brothers and 1 sister: Paris, Ricky and Jake. they are very sweet animals and the breeding part was helpful as i am getting prepared for my spiderlings :-D"
