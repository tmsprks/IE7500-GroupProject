1,Cape Codder Review,"For the price they charge, this liner is a waste of money. Seven dollars for a liner at the bottom of the toaster oven. I got ripped off.Steve B"
1,Bad product,I was unable to even use it for a day. It just blew up as I plugged it in to the outlet.
1,Outdated,"This exam guide is a hot mess. The information in it is far too obscure for the FSOT, and the majority of it has a focus on the 70's--which makes it about 30+ years out of date in the focus. While it never hurts just to look over the material, it really isn't a good way to assess your knowledge base. Use it for grammar review, if nothing else."
1,It's just Ok,I have been using this shampoo for about a month now and have not noticed any difference yet. It's either that this is a fake product or just not an effective one.
1,Slow Flow and Leaky,"My wife and I bought the VentAires when our first child was born. They appeared to be top of the line. They certainly were marketed that way and priced that way. We found the nipple flow to be way too slow and they leaked! No one likes a leaky bottle at 3AM on a December night in New England. It is also difficult to tell if the infant/new born is actually taking the formula. We ended up donating the six VentAires that we bought to a local daycare center and bought EvenFlo bottles, which have been great (and less money). All-in-all, we give this product a POOR grade and state, in our opinion, that they are not worth the extra money."
1,"Good cast, poor film","When I saw the cast of this film, I hired it. It wasn't bad but I can't say that I was overwhelmed with enthusiasm. It was a bit slow although the surprising twist at the end makes you think how you make emotive assumptions based on the facts which are often quite erroneous. I won't say more so as not to spoil it for you but it wasn't up to my expectations."
1,Not worth it,"Just ordered this back in June and had to return it in July as the back strap is beginning to fray.. Basically, this is a backpack made by Targus for HP. If you open it, it is fairly basic and I am not 100% if it is waterproof. I returned it as I discovered the strap issue beginning to develop within 2 weeks and Amazon was efficient in processing my retun. I bought an Adidas Chapman bag as a replacement. Far more comfortable and convenient."
1,Kushies pre-fold diapers - not what I expected,"Planning to use cloth diapers vs. disposable, I ordered these pre-fold diapers. I am somewhat disappointed however, as when I follow the instructions to ""fold"" the diaper, it looks really, really small. I'm not sure how long I'll be able to use these and I don't see any size indication that would suggest I could order larger ones. I probably won't be using these for anything other than burp cloths or mop-up towels. Very disappointing."
1,WORTHLESS!!!!,This book and CD roms are worthless for modeling. I found maybe 1 percent useful models. You will have better luck on 3d Cafe or some other free site!
1,Is this a memoir or a history textbook?,"I'm not sure what kind of audience Sparks was attempting to capture with this memoir. It seemed about half a history textbook and half an actual memoir. Someone who picks up this book would probably be someone interested in brotherly bonding, not the history of Machu Picchu."
1,Remember the last time MTV did good? Me Neither.,"Music-wise, MTV used to deliver good videos and the like, then turned to reality shows (and the like). Based on what I heard from this CD (I was tricked; who would pay even 1/4 of its price for this drivel?), they have sunk to a new low. This bunch of imposters is geared for the group of snotty-nosed bumpy-faced kids who still laugh at potty jokes even as they long to be ""grown-ups"" with the attendant freedom. No, they apparently long to just grow more to be teenagers. This drivel is for the very immature and is rotting compost to nurture the minds of our ""leaders of tomorrow"". God help us. And a pox on the hellbound creators of this ""group"""
1,Big ol' waste of time,"Bad advice, though good intentioned. I think it sets up very unrealistic expectations for new parents, not to mention offering some unsafe advice."
1,This is NOT a novel!!!!,This is a COMIC BOOK. For those RR Martin fans please understand that this is a graphic novel. . aka comic book.
1,keep you money,"your money could be well spent on something other than this, not any better than a regular pair of gloves you can buy at wal-mart."
1,GEORGE FORMAN GRILL,"I have used my grill about five times. It makes excellent hamburgers - draining away most of the fat. The negative thing is as I was cleaning it, the ""non-stick"" surface wiped off - I was using a Handi-wipe which should not have caused this."
1,Garbage,"It looked funny but turned out to be lousy! A very disappointing film, the preview was actually the highlight of the entire movie!"
1,Dora,Dora's backpack adventure was too easy. My three and a half year old completed level 2 in about 15-20 minutes. The third level is only harder because it the activities are in Spanish. She loves Dora but was bored with it the second time around.
1,The rumor of a ghost writer will persist with this one!,"I'm afraid the ""Cat Who..."" series is on a downhill slide. Although a quick read, this 25th title was flat & unmysterious. We know the villain practically from the get-go, and the story lacks the usual subtle clues building up to the ultimate solving of the crime. Come to think of it, there wasn't even much of a story! Major events like the fund-raiser are given short shrift, & important details such as Polly's leaving the library are glossed over. The characters, whom we know so well from the previous books, are one-dimensional. For that matter, where ARE they all? Chief Brodie barely makes an appearance, & then only as a bagpiper, and his classy daughter, Fran, has suddenly become a snobby lush we don't recognize. This can no longer be considered a mystery series which leads me to ask ""Who wrote this book?"""
1,Written by an author unfamiliar with Law & Order the TV show,"Boy was this ever sad - Lennie Briscoe was somehow magically promoted to a Sergeant in Dead End and the DA was Adam Wentworth (and not Adam Schiff as in the show). The dialogue is stilted, there are few descriptions and the plot is weak...."
1,Blank Disc!,"I bought this as a gift and when we went to play the DVD it was blank! Worse yet, it would freeze up my DVD player every time I would try to access the menu. I'm not even sure if I'm allowed to return it for a full refund because the package has been opened.I don't think I'll ever buy a DVD from here again. Lousy product. Waste of money."
1,rippoff,"all of the gameboy's are a...lot of money for nothing and NOTHING EDUCATIONAL. I am sorry for this purchase. My son, of course, loves it. It would be nice if there were something smarter than [junk]. NO THANKS TO YOU ALL. IT WOULD BE JUST AS EASY TO OFFER EDUCATION AND PEACE... THANKS FOR THE RIPOFF. I also notice that the gameboy isNOT compatible with gameboy advance.. BEWARE BUYERS!!!!"
1,Very unorginal,This movie is very unoriginal. Its like that movie Pocahontas but with blue cats in it. It has cool graphics and the military tech stuff is cool. But I should of rented this instead of buying it.
1,not what I expected.,"This book, based on personal experience was a bit New Age for me and I was looking more for factual information instead of mystic thoughts."
1,A Very Bad Movie,"Bad acting, bad writing, incoherent plot and lots of inaccuracies. Don't even bother renting this one."
1,Cut-Off Tool,"The wrong tool was shipped to us, because the wrong picture was in the Amazon.com site. This was not the tool we wanted. We returned the tool and received notification of credit granted, but have not received any refund as yet."
1,What a mess,"I'm confused as to how anyone could possibly mistake this mass of garbage as being a decent film. Poor acting, lousy score, cheesy dialogue, weak special effects... I could go on. The ""coolest"" thing about this movie is the cover of the DVD case. If you're interested in foreign sci-fi try The Returner, Casshern or Steamboy. This waste of celluloid isn't even worth a rental let alone a purchase."
1,"Good sound quality, very poor construction","I purchased a pair of these earbuds this past December. I was very pleased with the sound quality- clear, deep bass and good overall balance. I was using them at my computer and walking to work. Last week, I was taking them out of my ears in a very standard fashion, and the right earbud broke into two pieces, leaving the wire hanging out. Naturally, I was surprised. With a price tag like this and a brand name like Monster, I expected more.I contacted Monster's customer support via email 5 days ago outlining the problem, and have yet to receive a response. Needless to say I am hesitant to recommend this product to others."
1,CAN'T REVIEW SOMETHING THAT NEVER ARRIVED.,"I ordered the Mr. Bill ""doll"" as a humorous gift for my daughter's birthday, but it never arrived."
1,image is deceiving,"picture is not clear on important detailsi.e. that there is a middle bridge support, or the rear lip.which is a design flaw as the lip cracks easily during shipping, as mine did!"
1,Too much loud music and not enough audio.,"I was very dissapointed when I played this CD as I was expecting information to be given in the author's voices. Instead, it's a woman's voice but the music drowns her out so that you really can't hear much of what she's saying."
1,not the right size,"O.K. So my pet rat Jelly Bean might be on the ""husky"" side, but he couldn't fit into this igloo even if I put him on a carb free diet! Even when i turned the igloo upside down and sat him in it, he filled the entire structure up completely! (There is even a picture of a rat on this sized igloo) The idea of the igloo sounds good so i am going to order the Large one because he does love his hammock!"
1,A Disappointing Follow-Up to Running with Scissors,"Fans of Augusten Burroughs's Running with Scissors might want to think twice before purchasing this shallow, cliche-ridden, overly novelistic recovery memoir. It lacks nearly every quality that made Running with Scissors such a funny and life-affirming read."
1,A Very Strange Rant,"For those who thought the Civil War was over more than a century ago, this author's diatribe - purportedly to set the record straight, but clearly to settle old scores - comes as a bit of a shock. Gilmore, at least, is apparently still mad as hell and still fighting for Missouri and The Confederacy, against Kansas, the Union, the federal government, historians, and Lord-knows-whatall. His theses could have been interesting to those who seek better understanding of this period of American history and this region of the country, but Gilmore's obvious, partisan bias wrecks his credibility. Other reviewers have pointed out specific factual problems with Gilmore's assertions. I do not recommend this book to anyone who is serious about sound regional or Civil War history."
1,Not as I have imagined,"I was a little disappointed with this shampoo. I expected more, because it is not a cheap one. The smell is good, but that's it."
1,Stinkingly Useless,"A collection of tepid ""story ideas"" seemingly culled from back issues of TV Guide, and inane snippets of ""dialogue."" Perfect for old divorcees in creative writing classes getting in touch with themselves... wait, nah, I was just trying to be mean--even they'd hate this nonsense. My apologies to old divorcees.Stay away! This is a con to take your money. If you need writing ideas, you're better off sticking your head underwater or looking around your cell--that's what these people did."
1,more techniques than you can shake a stick at!,"180 pages of more techniques than you could possibly use. The formulas are well explained, the strategies (series of 7, magic number of three, moving averages, exponential moving averages, stochastics, csi, rsi, regression analysis, etc) are also well explained. As somone who has searched for the ultimate formula, oscillator, technique or what ever for trading commodities, after reading this book, I've concluded that you can find a chart or group of charts to justify ANY idea. Given any market, depending on which combination of indicators one chooses, one could justify any decision. Now what good is that?"
1,I didn't receive this item yet. I have no idea what happened.,I didn't receive this item yet. I placed an order on August 12. I have no idea what happened in transition. I want to know whom I should contact.
1,Before you buy this Hoover,"Take the $68 you were going to spend on this Hoover product, and walk over to the toilet and flush it down the drain. This is by the far worst product I have ever bought on Amazon. I have had it repaired twice at Hoover store, no warranty coverage even though it was under warranty, fine print said it was not a warranty repair, each repair was $25, so now I am up over $100 for this piece of crap! The belt will not stay on it for over 5 minutes without slipping off. You then have to use a screwdriver to take off 4 screws to get the bottom cover off to put the belt back on, only to have it slip off again 5 minutes later. I finally got more pleasure out of taking it out to the driveway and smashing into as many pieces as I could to dispose it in the garbage can. Hoover is a joke and this vacuum is a joke! DO NOT BUY A HOOVER PRODUCT as they will not warranty it and it is junk! Sorry there were no zero stars for this product!!!"
1,Iron Man is 2 1/2 minutes shorter than the original,"As other people have pointed out, Iron Man is edited on this. On the Paranoid CD it's 5:58; here it's 3:29. A chunk of one solo is removed --poorly--in addition to the premature fade out. Bummer."
1,rides up - impossible to wear!,"I had to return this bra after trying to wear it for one day. It kept riding up so badly that I was afraid I was going to fall out of it every time I moved my arms. I don't know who thought up this product, but they obviously did not test it on real women in everyday activities."
1,Only useful for teaching children about selfish behavior,"A sing-song, fun enough book until the end. As other readers have clearly explained, Duck enlists the aid of passing animals to help him, then happily driving away, leaving the animals who helped him stuck in the mud themselves without so much as a shouted ""thank you"". As my daughter succinctly explained, ""That's not nice."" I'm sure some readers will love the colorful pictures and dismiss such negative reviews, but consider yourself forewarned."
1,Misguided to say the least,"Looking for a book full of misinformation? You've found it! Looking for a truly informative book to learn about witchcraft? Try Spiral Dance or, frankly, anything else. A respectable resource on learning true witchcraft would NEVER speak of witchcraft and satanism as if they were at all related. This makes them sound as if they were practically the same thing! Want to get a witch in a snit? Ask if she/he worships satan. Skip this poor excuse and get a book that was written by someone who actually understands witchcraft."
1,My cat would not even look at this toy.,"Your mileage may differ, but my cat was completely uninterested in the Cat Dancer. She literally would not even look at it.I think this would be best for very young kittens who will bat at anything that moves."
1,Skil cordless rachet,"okay for a short while, then switch started working only intermittantly. About the 7th or 8th time I used it...it wouldn't turn on at all...threw it in the garbage."
1,Quality Problems,"Ordered 2. Order process easy. Delivery when expected, but 1-was VERY poorly assembled and I have had to re-inforce it twice now."
1,Save Your Money,"I purchased this publication mainly to obtain information about how men might benefit from the use of natural progesterone. I was disappointed with what I received. Dr. John R. Lee just published a booklet about hormone balancing for men, and I recommend his publication as opposed to Dr. Shealy's. This booklet had some interesting information but, if you're interested in this subject, consider a book with more indepth information."
1,This is a SCAM!!,Product made me so sick I had to go to the hospital-its loaded with caffeine. I am so UNHAPPY!
1,Disappointed!,Awful service! I'm still waiting for the book to arrive! How can I follow-up to find out the status of my order?
1,Not this time,"I had been a big fan of Leslie Meier's other Lucy Stone books.They provided a light, lesurely read for cozy mystery fans.Unfortunately with The Birthday Party Murder, Meier abandonsher attention to the mystery and takes her audience on aheinous ride through her heroine's mind. Throughout the book,the reader is subjected to Lucy's trials and tribulations.Her plights with overeating, weight, husband, cranky boss,pre-teen daughter and lazy college son are so countless,the book starts to feel like a novel adaptation of TheJerry Springer Show. Meier needs to stick to her plot andhow her character's relate to the murder. In the past,Lucy was a warm, humorous character because of herinsecurities and knack for getting into trouble. Here,she comes off more like a complainer who can't stop whining.I really like Leslie Meier writing style and feel she'll writemore good books, The Birthday Party Murder simply isn't oneof them."
1,This book is racist.,"Although the first half of the book was easy and pleasant enough to hold my attention, the second half was horrible. I just finished the book and I have a raging headache. The plot arche is bad enough, the the racist sub-plot just made the whole thing intolerable."
1,this album is nothing but a bunch of blah!!!!,"This is anything but a tribute album. When I think of a tribute album, I think of the Depeche Mode, Music For The Masses. It has bands like The Cure, Smashing Pumpkins, God lives Under Water, and so on doing Depeche Mode covers. But the songs that the bands cover are in their own music's style. The Cure with their moody pop, Smashing Pumpkis with alternative rock, god lives underwater with industrial. The tribute bands preserved the original songs sound, while adding their own flavor.BUT, this ""tribute"" album for R.E.M. is complete garbgage!!! The band played the original R.E.M. music, with out any originality and they sound like a highschool garage band, while the singers tries way too hard to sound like Mike Stipes. In other words, this album misses the point of what a tribute album is (see the first paragraph to know what a tribute album is)"
1,Racist Against Santa Claus,"After 1,000 years of spreading Christmas cheer, Santa Claus turns evil and kills people at Christmastime. Lame! The only redeeming value of this film is its humor. The reason most people like it is that Santa kills people. Ooooh. Entertaining. I think the Chronicles of Narnia did a better job. They had Santa Claus in that film, but they didn't even need him to kill people. And since when is murder and killing regarded as funny?"
1,You can do better,"The hard drive on my iPod with video is shot and I didn't even drop it or anything. The Apple store said the warranty was voided because the case was scratched. So I think they are way too sensitive. Does Apple think people will buy these things and then set them on a shelf?Anyway, all ranting aside, you can get way more features, same capacity, better battery life, etc. for the same or lower price. I know iPods look cool and they are easy to use, but the product just isn't worth that much money. These days you can do so much better, especially if you have a windows PC, just do some more searching on Amazon! If you have a Mac, as I do, it might still be worth it to get an iPod because a lot of other mp3 players aren't compatible, but maybe just a Nano, unless you have money to burn. I'm done with Apple, though. Being fancy-looking just isn't enough."
1,Think Twice,"I purchased this for my new PSP, as I fly overseas often, and wanted the longer battery life. However, this does not fit my PSP. It seems to be for another, larger model (maybe an earlier version of the PSP?). The unit does not sit properly in the cradle, so the contact does not touch. So the battery power is not accessible. In short, it's useless. Buy something else."
1,If you think vol 4 is bad try vols 123,"The author, a distinguished psychologist, has written a definitive compendium of his magnum opus.Unfortunately his ability to write is not equal to his incisive intellect, and the prose is inaccessible to many. To understand his important work consult the books of Donald Nathanson."
1,DON'T BUY THIS CD!!!,This is 2CD's with 50 SHORTENED-TO-90-SECONDS SONGS of Raymond Lefevre per CD. To my opinion it's unethical to sell this CD's at such an high price AND without informing possible buyers of the facts. DON'T BUY IT!!
1,Superficial,You go through the book and do not find the meat. It is more like a coffee table book. Not useful to mi as structural engineer.
1,WARNING: Shipping box displays picture,"I ordered this item as a Christmas gift for my husband. Unfortunately, it was delivered with a picture of the product on the side. Since my husband got to the UPS delivery before I did, he already knows what his gift is. Don't order this as a surprise unless your gift recipient doesn't live with you!"
1,Call it something else - but it has nearly nothing to do with the Bourne series,Tried to like this - just couldn't make it work. Not even enough action for an action movie. Perhaps others will find it more interesting than I did?
1,"A HUGE insult to the whole ""Chainsaw"" series!","This movie has to be the biggest let down out of the whole ""Texas Chainsaw"" series. In this film, you can't get in more then five minutes before you want to shut it off. All the characters, especially Leatherface, are the biggest bunch of idiots in this film! It was supposed to be a re-make of the first film, but all it was, was an insult to the first film. If you've never seen the ""Chainsaw"" films, then I advise you to stick with the first two and maybe check out the third one if you want a good laugh. However, STAY AWAY from this one!! It's not even worth the one star I gave it!"
1,Oh my God!!!,"After listening to this whatever it is, music it ain't, I was struck by how much Newsom reminds me of Florence Foster Jenkins. Apparently FFJ has been reborn! Oh well, at least Bjork can sing! Now I have some more examples for my school and church choirs as to ""how not to sing""!"
1,Cooking is fun,My wife found this book at a thrift shop and we had to order one from youm to give as a present for our neighbors. My wife really used this book.
1,Water + Hanes = Shrinkage,"I really wanted to like these undershirts. I purchased a size based on their charts and (before washing) really enjoyed the shirts. Very breathable, long enough to tuck in my pants, etc. BUT after one wash these shirts have shrunk to a fraction of their original size. Now they are tight in my armpits, the sleeves have run up so much they are barely nonexistent, and my (once wonderful) shirt that tucked comfortably into my pants now hangs uncomfortably above my waist. These were advertised as pre-washed and therefore pre-shrunk, but I just can't believe it. So now I'm $30 bucks out and will have to replace my undershirts."
1,Waste of Money,"When I first decided to buy a digital camera I had a choice of two: Sony DSC F828 and Canon Digital Rebel. I chose Sony. The picture quality that Sony produces is excellent, but Canon gives you ability to change lenses. In order to extend the zoom on my Sony camera I went on to a massive search for something that would increase 7.1x zoom. I came across this Opteka add on lens. Couple of weeks ago it arrived and it was tested immediately with disappointing results. I followed Opteka's suggestion that comes on a little leaflet, but the pictures are very blury. After trying several combinations and realising that it doesn't work properly, I gave up. Right now I am looking to replace Sony camera with EOS 350D or probably even EOS 20D. My advice is not to bother with this add on. If anyone made there Opteka Lens working on DSC F828 please share it."
1,Nightmare Palm,"This was the first haldheld I ever got (September/05).It started to work fine but after I deleted a software itgot frozen. After navigating to the support site and spendinghours till I got a representative to talk to (you can do itfor free only in the first 90 days), I was able to doa proper re-set. It worked fine for a while but then itstopped turning on after you turned it off. The only wayto put it back on was by doing a hard reset all the timeyou wanted it to turn on. The warranty period expired (90 days),so to get it fixed I'd have to pay almost the price of a newhand-held."
1,Not as interesting.,I think of Caroline Myss' other two books as adding to my information and spiritual knowledge. This boook however does not have the same effect. It's main theme is to 'pay it forward'.
1,Failed like many others,"Like other reviews, the product worked great for about 2 years then stopped. It doesn't seem to sense that there is a current draw from the washing machine and therefore it won't open up the solenoid valves to allow water in. I took it off so we could do the laundry. Not sure what I'm going to do next."
1,The Constant Gardener,"We found this movie too long for the story line. It was a typical who done it. It was hard to hear what some of the actors were saying. Overall, boring."
1,piece of crap!!!!!!!,This movie was suppose to be the remake of one of the greatest movies ever.It turned out to the biggest pileof horse **** ever!!!!!!! If you would like to be scared get the first oneand the book
1,blue,"i never got the product. i got some kind of plastic valve, which i sent back. that valve must have cost 10 times the cost of the blue, which i had to buy which at auto zone."
1,Don't waste your money,"I'm a very dissatisfied customer. First of all, when the steamer arrived, the box looked as if it been handled by a gorilla. The product does not appear to be damaged, but when using it, it sprays large amounts of water all over the garments and the floor. It makes such a mess, it's not worth my time to use it. Good HouseKeeping screwed up when they put their seal on this product."
1,It truly is ABC. Very basic,"This book is VERY basic and just a guide to surface grandparenting. If you are past this and looking for solutions to issues, it is not very helpful. Becoming a Grandmother and Essential Grandparenting were much more helpful w/ offering solutions for me. I agree that it is a great gift for a first time grandmother before the baby is born, if given by a friend. If given by a daughter or in-law, it could require some real diplomacy in the presentation!"
1,Book was a gift - Glad I didn't spend my money,"For Block's reputation and slew of awards, I was disappointed.I read a lot of crime novels, and enjoy the masters -- Leonard, Parker, the MacDonalds, Westlake/Stark, Healy, McBain, Emerson, Kaminsky, Dobyns, Mayor, etc., and none of their novels I have read included the blunders made in this one.* * * Spoilers * * *Just for example:The bad guy is a forensics savant, capable of teaching the writers of the CSI programs new tricks about leaving a crime scene evidence-free, yet he kills 2 victims on crowded subways and the author doesn't mention blood once -- not even on the knife the killer takes with him. The climax reads like a made-for-TV movie, where the intended victim hasn't been left alone for weeks, and, yet, just after Scudder and the intended victim agree that the killer is still in town and still after her, he leaves her alone to get the newspaper! And guess who is just down the hall at that moment? Please!"
1,Sorry but this is a rehash of their old style,"I am sorry to say this because I like Coldplays earlier work. Unforutnatly this is exactly what X&Y; is -- a cold replay of their earlier work. Based on this album, the Band has not grown in terms of their music or the issues they deal with.I bought this album on the advice of a friend who said that they loved the band and this was the best yet. I guess they did love the band as they were -- because this is what we are getting. Unfortunatly, I was hoping to find a band that would grow and change as I have.If you want more of Parachutes and Rush of Blood, then go for it and revel. If you are looking for something more, then take a pass on this one."
1,Parenting a Child With Seneory Processing Disorder: A Family Guide to Understandiung & Supporting Your Sensory-sensitive Child,"I found some usefuly information in this book and have shared one chaper with my sons' Kindergarten teacher. In general I found this book very dry and hard to read, I kept falling asleep reading it no matter when I tried to read it. It just did not flow and keep my attention nor did it read like a text book, it just was not for me and I would not recommend it. I would like to offer I have read about 15 books on sensoery integration so I was knowledgable in this subject matter, maybe to a person just starting the sensory issues it would be better suited."
1,Deja vu (like a bad dream over and over again!),"Wow! Can you hear it?? Listen - listen very carefully! The music here is the same as Kelly Clarkson's album, only with different lyrics and Clay singing instead of Kelly! Can I sue somebody??"
1,bah!,"band starts off modestly; band gains attention; band gets really good; band attains well-deserved popularity; band gets great; band receives well-deserved respect......band spits on it.this album is a sham. a perfect example of a group of supremely talented musicians reaching the highest level of worldly fame, where they can do no wrong, and thereafter spending a few addled nights in a studio, eventually releasing to the world (as a sort of grand esoteric, private joke) and album most of our little brothers and sisters could have created. i speak in hyperbole, of course...but just barely."
1,Great! BUT defective...,"We received this item as a baby shower gift. Now that our baby is almost 5 months, She LOVES it! The problem is she is almost too tall for it. We have a standard size doorway so it should be fine but the strap is as high as it can go and she is still too low. We just contacted Graco about this problem so hopefully they can send a replacement."
1,NOT FOR RUNNING SHOES,"These laces are elastic. I read the other review where someone used them to replace their Salomon laces, which is what I needed done. I don't run in Salomon's anymore but did like the lacing system, so I have purchased Salomon replacement laces in the past and used them on other running shoes, so I thought I'd give this cheaper set a shot.My shoe size is 9.5 and these laces barely were able to fit the shoe. They are elastic so I am still able to slip the shoe on but I have no need to tighten the laces. In fact they are a little too snug. First run I did in them I had to stop to adjust the laces because they were cutting off circulation.If you are looking to use something for running spend the money and buy a Salomon pair."
1,Not Freestanding - Set Up Too Long AVOID,"The box DOES not say it requires all corners to be staked out. Not until you read the manual. Had to return. It looks free standing in the ad and on the box. So if you are in Sand, Snow, hard or wet ground You can not really set up. Also, It would take too long to setup if weather changed. This is NOT for serious fast packers or experienced backpackers (31 years now). Based upon prior use of Eureka products I expected better, they blew it. Other reviewers said the poles broke too easily. Equipment should be designed and tested by real world users, not cube slaves. ALWAYS test gear before you venture out."
1,Legendary bunch of SCHLOCK!!!,"I bought this thinking I was getting top quality digitally remastered or rerecorded excerpts from these great films. In fact what you get is poorly transfered snips of the original soundtracks. The sound is so poor that I couldn't stand listening to this disc on my high quality stereo, prefering to hear it on my small bookshelf system. Approximately 55 minutes of pure SCHLOCK! Do the math; 28 tracks in 55 mins. The selections are so short that the listener gets ""zero"" feel of the film and the music score that accompanies it. The only value is that the selections are arranged in chrono order according to the date of film release.Skimpy liner notes are provided. If I were a professor instructing the art of film noir and used this disc, it would sure send any student running. I advise checking out other titles of the genre, theres' some good ones out there. Be careful of bootleg import junk like this!"
1,*Sigh*,"What happened? Did I miss something? When did the Offspring become a pop-rock band? And after such albums as Smash, one of my all-time favorite albums.I liked that one because it was widely appealing to alternative fans of all sorts. Melodic, yet heavy. This one sounds just watered down. The music is weaker, and the lyrics lack meaning.Except ""The Kids Aren't All Right"" That song is true Offspring, not watered down pop. Please,do yourself a favor and pick up ""Smash"". I assure you that you won't be disappointed."
1,Purple prose does not make for good writing,"Perhaps this book, and the horrible predecessor KUSHIEL'S CHOSEN, would not have been so disappointing if the first one wasn't so unusual. The purple prose and self-aggrandizing style of narration set my teeth on edge, but I read and enjoyed DART because it was different. This book, however, shows that you can drag something out too long when it is built around a single, exploitative gimmick.I pray now that this truly is the end of this series, and that Ms. Carey will extend her talents elsewhere."
1,Stick with Conair,"The adjustable slider combs are horrible and I found the Conair where you had several combs to choose from worked better for me. I cannot get it to cut the hair on my husband who likes it very short, it would not even take any hair off. All it did was waste money and electricity to charge the battery. I thought this was the best brand out there, but Conair beats them by a mile. I think I will take it back and get a refund and go buy a Conair with the money."
1,Doesn't fit,"It wasn't one of those keyboard covers that completely fits around your keyboard where you can leave it on and type. I was looking for a keyboard cover that was like that. but the shipping was so expensive, it's not worth returning."
1,"Some parts are quite clever, but it gets old quickly","I bought this book on a whim, having seen an interview with the author on the Today Show when I was on vacation and on the lookout for a light read. There were some nice segments, but on the whole, it seemed somewhat self-indulgent on the author's part. My favorite part was the feeling in the beginning of the book that you were ""inside their heads"", but these explanations appeared to grow longer as we became more familiar with the characters rather than the reverse. It was like being with someone who loves the sound of their own voice--you may keep listening, but part of you tunes out.Having labored through the second half, with little additional (or unexpected) development, I wish I had skipped the last 200 pages and just read the last chapter. I didn't even give this one to the resale shop."
1,confusing and boring story,"I had really high hopes for this book when I bought it. Seemed like an interesting premise. I've read other books by this author and they were interesting, at least. This book was confusing and really quite boring. The first half of the book (200 pages) basically has the very forgettable characters doing not much of anything. When the ""action"" finally starts, the menacing artifact is about as scary as a ham sandwich. I have to be honest, I didn't even finish the book. I stopped about 50 pages from the ending because I just couldn't stand it anymore."
1,Simply does not work,"The little green thingies that are suppposed to trip the switch don't line up right, so they pass right by without causing the switch to go on. The design concept is good, but it simply does not work. I've had an identical Intermatic timer like this and used it for years and years...it was good. Intermatic usually makes good stuff, but this must have been made somewhere cheap and it does not work."
1,Pampers Swaddlers Size1/2 234 pack,"Nice size, good for the money for pampers diapers, but just did not work well with my daughter. Does not have band around the back of the diaper so with my daughter the poop goes right up the back. I just use up and up at target which do great with her and my money."
1,Nowhere near their best!,"OK, I admit, this CD does have some good cuts on it...damn good cuts, actually. But not even half this album is good. Only five songs on it are really good: ""Know Your Rights,"" ""Straight to Hell,"" ""Ghetto Defendant,"" and the two mega-hits...you see, the Clash were at least wiser than other bands to put their good songs out as singles. Still, so many of the songs are scattered and experimental that it's pitiful. You may get it for the good songs, but still...pay VERY little for it, like I did. And please get their first album and London Calling. Adios!"
1,"What a creative, original idea for a book!","NOT. Have you read ""The Hunt for Red October""? Have you seen ""Crimson Tide""? If so, then it won't take you long to see exactly where the story for Robin White's ""Typhoon"" came from. Mix equal parts ""Red October"" and ""Crimson Tide"" and you end up with this book. The book is well-executed, but it's just impossible to get past White's wholesale theft of ideas and concepts from other ""submarine"" books and movies. Very disappointing."
1,More like a VCD player than a DVD player,"This product serves me fine as a VCD player, which is what I was looking for. However, this is an inferior DVD player and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone looking to buy a real DVD player, especially since there are better ones out there for only approx $$$$$ dollars more. The reason I purchased this item was because my Sony PS2 couldn't play VCDs and there were a couple of movies out only on VCD format that I wanted to watch. To be fair, this bargain priced item serves its purpose but I was shocked about how tacky and cheap this player looks. Its performance is almost just as bad, for example, a simple remote controlled command literally takes this unit a full second or two to response. ......"
1,Beat Yourself Blind !,"If sugar coated vocals with slightly heavy guitar playing is your thing then this should be a must for you.Personally I was a bit disappointed;Radar Love,Broken Heart,When the Children Cry(good acoustic guitar),Cry for Freedom(very radio friendly),Lady of the Valley(Live! ),Farewell To You(One of the many ballads),are a few of the no.'s that save this album.White Lion is a great band to start with especially if you're graduating from Bryan Adams and looking for something your mama would approve of.Not everybody in leathers and long hair rocks!"
1,Terrible Sound Mix,I had to crank my sound way up to hear any dialog in the movie and I have a really good Harmon Kardon system.
1,not that good,runny and does not stick to any type of wire I tried it on even though I followed directoins. Stick with colored tape.
1,"shallow, manipulative, over-simplified","It's a mystery to me why this book is so well-respected. As far as I can tell, it has only one character-- Celie-- and the rest are just empty figures who are either ""good"" or ""bad"" based most of all on whether they're male (bad, threatening, violent) or female (good, nurturing, uplifting). The plot is overly simplistic and manipulative- there just isn't much of interest here. If you had an option for 0 stars, I'd have given it 0."
1,Too Much Repetition with this disc!,"I thought that this album was kind of a bummer because after the 3rd track it all sounded the same to me. Yes i admit that the tones are cool but they're songwriting is not anywhere as interesting as other bands of the genre - namely the Untamed Youth, Boss Martians, MOAM, and others. I feel that this album was not sincere in its attempt to do vocals like the aforementioned groups. More like they were forced to try and do them. I do like their album Savage Island a lot as it seems natural - this one does not. ronni"
1,"Not an RPG game, not much of a shooter, either.","When I bought this game for my Dreamcast, I was craving an RPG. I hoped that Armada would be able to tide me over untill a more traditional role-playing game came out. There is practically no RPG element to this game, however, and the shooter aspect gets boooooring fast. If you want a role-player, buy a role-player, if you want a shooter, buy a shooter. This game is not much of either. ...I'm going to the pawn shop."
1,"The Worst ""Book"" I Ever ""Read""","I found this ""book"" lying on a colleague's desk and I ""read"" it on my next bathroom break. Seriously, that's how much ""content"" it contains.My mother taught me if I can't say anything nice, don't say anything. Well, here goes... This might be passable for a grade 2 classroom. There, I did it.For anyone else who can read a newspaper and maintain a tenuous grasp on the outer world, it's an insulting, puerile, simplistic, undeveloped, nasty, de-motivating, cynical piece of hucksterism and apologia for anyone recklessly wielding power over another.Heed the advice to buy some ""real"" cheese instead of this book: That will definitely feed your brain better than this piece of mindless drivel."
1,NOT WHAT I THOUGHT,"I was disapointed, it was not what I thought it would be. It's rap and I expected it to be like what was featured in Kill Bill 2"
1,BORING.,"As a freshman nutrition major, this book was required for my English 101 class. I found it to be boring, unhelpful, and plodding. The author's instructions for activities leave you depressed and annoyed, and teachers have to jump around a lot to instruct properly.This might be a good reference book, and perhaps even a book for secondary/high schools, but not for a college English class."
1,"Short, but not sweet.","I hope no one pays for this. I got it free for my Kindle, and even then, it wasn't worth the trouble. I love Mark Twain, but this little thing (not even a story, really) was quite silly."
1,The con man,Never really could generate any interest in this book. Was tempted a few times to delete it from my kindle before i even finished the book. I hung in there but still not generate any interest. My first read of this author and my last.
1,"Buy cheap, get cheap","The Rogue Baritone Ukulele KC is made in China and is very inferior. One fret was too loose to fix, all frets had limits to how tight they could be turned, strings had poor support, strings would not hold tuning, even when good frets were tightened, sound quality is very poor. I have an old Martin that was always easy to tune, held its tuning, produced great sound, and had very good frets and supports. I recommend this Rogue ukulele to noone, and warn potential buyers to walk away from the item. I am sorry that Giardinelli ""Musicians' Friend"" carries such equipment, because it diminishes the company image. Jim Moore drjimmoore@harborside.com"
1,Two boys' review: A playset that plays more like an accessory,"Pleased with our first playset purchase --Mattel Matchbox 360 Pop-Up Pirate Island(see my review) -- we bought the Ratatouille Kitchen Chaos Playset.So, why the low ratings for Ratatouille?1. The playset doesn't offer much to do. There aren't many accessories, certainly not enough to pretend cooking, which we thought was the point of a kitchen playset. You get a couple pots and ladles but nothing to put inside the pots.2. The playset needs to include more characters. You get Remy the rat. That's it. So, you playtime consists of Remy wandering around an empty kitchen (no food) and nobody else around.A playset should include enough items to make it fun by itself. This is actually a Ratatoille accessory. If you own a lot of the other movie-related toys, you'll enjoy this toy more."
1,Has never worked properly,"I received this as a gift, and it actually will grind peppercorns for about 3 seconds before the mechanism stops working. It continues to try to turn the grinder, but the grinder itself stops moving. Total waste of money."
1,"least favorite arrangement of my ""most favorite"" piece","I LOVE pachalbel canon. I have several different arrangements. However I was dissapointed by this arrangement and by the accompanying baroque compositions on this CD. For those who have never heard the canon, or have only heard this arrangement -- you will still love it. It is, after all, an incredible piece of music. However, try another CD for an even more moving rendition."
1,dougv,"Interesting to see some Chinese scenery and culture.The movie is slow moving.My main concern is that the lines and characters are too sweet or sugary. Most of the Christians don't seem real: toomany smiles and they were overly nice.The main character, Jenna, was naive. A little research by her on the present day China would show they are totalitarian.I don't recommend you see this movie."
1,too little information,This book is used as a platform for the author to show off his celebrity friends and to promote his new line of make-ups. Only the first few pages contain some hints on make-up. The title is misleading and the book does not deliver on its promises.
1,Not for me....,"Well i had this thing for 5 weeks before it blew. upon waiting to long to return it, i cut it open and the voice coil was tiny and broke to hell and back.Just really not good. And this thing isnt pre-amplified just so you know. I would just got an 8 inch anything else in a normal box."
1,Offensive,"This has gotta be the worst script I've ever heard in a movie. Kevin Smith seems to be trying for a world record in tastelessness. His jokes aren't funny or clever, just vulgar. Like other overrated screenwriters like Matt Damon/Ben Affleck and Tarantino, Smith seems to think that there is merit in vulgarity. He doesn't realize that the is NO merit in such. Anyone can think of profanity; it requires niether creativity nor intelligence."
1,Motor Problem,"Not sure the first review went through so am sending a second one. After many years, my wife and I purchased this White Mountain Ice Cream Freezer. We were very pleased with the first effort to make ice cream. However, the second time we made ice cream we were not able to finish because the motor started making an extremely loud noise. We returned this freezer and requested a replacement and were pleased when we were sent another freezer. However, when we tried to make ice cream , we found we could not secure the motor because the left ""ear"" did not extend far enough for the latch to make contact with the ""ear"". We had to stand by the freezer while it was working to make sure the motor stayed secure. We are returning this one as well and requesting a replacement.Thanks."
1,weak,let it go is the best song on the disc.come the title track has a cool vamp and horn parts but this disc is lifeless and forgettable.
1,What's happened to Grisham?,"While ""The Brethren"" is not as didactic as ""Street Layer"", it seems that Grisham is trying to push his social agenda harder with his more recent novels. While I enjoyed ""The Testament"", most of his recent works have become tedious with the supposedly subtle core message of the book bludgeoning the reader while plot and character development disappear. I'm glad I borrowed this book to read, rather than purchasing."
1,I just love Rocky!!,"I can't get enough of Rocky and enjoy having the complete collection. This is the first time I veiwed ""Rocky Balboa"" which is the perfect completion of the saga. ""Yo Adrian"" Enjoy the ride!"
1,Had to fastforward through the boring and other parts....,"Please read the other reviews... I found them more interesting than watching the movie. The only reason I gave it 2 stars versus one is because the filmmaker does make interesting points about life and idiotic relationships. He does touch on real human weaknesses and expose them, and maybe that was why it was painful for me to watch some of it? I really disliked the main male protagonist... the Director. Yes, he was damaged, but why inflict it on other damaged souls? I feel he was using the women to cure his writers block. I wished the women would've turned around and run from him.. immediately... and kept their dignity. The ending was also unexpected... unpredictable... abrupt, but gave me some hope. OK, so you can get stuck in life, but with a little help you can get out. Maybe this film is a cautionary tale?"
1,"New cover, same bad movie.","This always was a bad movie. I was hoping the DVD would have interviews or behind the scenes (They must have been hilarious). Sadly it does not. Unsuspecting viewers will be fooled by the photoshopy cover on the DVD and the words ""Gold edition"" (which by the way is the same as the VHS edition only this time it says ""Gold Edition""). Don't judge a book by it's cover: this one's a stinker."
1,didn't work for us,We bought 2 of these heaters and they will not go above 56F degrees We have another heater as well that works very well and can heat up a whole room. The rest of our rooms with these heaters are EXTREMELY cold!I don't know why though because there has been no recalls and all the other reviews are positive. We are using these as our sole heat for our 650sq ft home and we are freezing. We have a total of 4 heaters 1 per room.
1,In A Simple Word: Yuck,"Ew, I don't own it, luckily, but heard it at a friend's house. To be honest, I didn't even listen to the whole thing. That would have been impossible. I heard one song in it's entirety and took a minute or so to listen to some of the others. No matter how wrong it was to name them anything associated with The Monkees, because Lord knows we have to ride on the coat tails of another band that did establish themselves, the music is horrible. It sounds like a bad version/rip-off of other 80s songs. I can't believe people actually bought this thing."
1,More of the same - only worse,"The original ""Bat Out of Hell"" held a certain perverse fascination to it. Overblown. Overwrought. Amazingly pretentious and totally devoid of any trace of humor or spontaneity. Listening to it was sort of like watching an accident that you can't prevent. You know it is going to happen, you know it is going to be awful, yet you can't stop yourself from taking part.So when Meat Loaf's career nose-dived after the album exploded in 1978, it was fairly inevitable we would get the sequel, and in 1993 we did. The problem is that by then the whole gimmick had gone from being bizarrely fascinating to being downright unpleasant. This is almost a note for note remake of the first ""Bat"" except for the fact that it is even more unpleasant, and doesn't hold that horrific appeal. The songs are bad (understatement) the arrangements bombastic and the whole project is lacking a trace of charm. Forget it."
1,Cheap wiring,"This cooler worked great - at first. The cooler itself did a fine job. However, the USB cord that connected it to my laptop pulled apart at two different places and exposed the inner electrical wires. After a week of the wires being exposed the cooler stopped working completely.If you don't mind spending [...] bucks every few months, go ahead and get this - because a few months is as long as it's going to last you."
1,I have never hated a device more,"I'm on the verge of turning this thing into a pile of smoking rubble. I've had countless problems with this printer, from print quality to the paper feed. This thing is a disaster. Heed my warning, DO NOT GET NEAR THIS THING."
1,Beware this is a Mono release,"I loved this Lp & wanted it on CD because The Past Masters (which has all of this) also has some crap on it & I love the cover. However upon inserting it into my computer I found that it is a Mono versions & bonus tracks, which are also MONO. Says so under Album column in I-tunes. Also comparing them side by side to the Past Masters versions you can hear the inferior recording. They don't sound bad exactly just not as clear & not in stereo. The packaging is another issue. Its' a cardboard sleeve (JUst like the LP). It is a beautifuly produced package with a high gloss cover , but for some reason they decided to make it bigger than the Jewell box. It will sit on a shelf next to your other CD's but will not fit in your traveler."
1,Legs Won't Stay Still,This dryer is great and gets super hot which makes for quick drying time however the mobility of the dryer is NOT AT ALL FUNCTIONAL! The dryer has roller wheels that are detachable so after which falls apart on you so easily. I would not purchase this dryer only for that purpose but if you think you can get around that issue then go for it. Also that little issue is not kid friendly so BEWARE!
1,"Crude, Despicable Film","The definition of obscene...no redeeming value. That a film like this can be made is deeply disturbing. I do not pay to watch actors pretend to kill animals in American films (with the statement that ""no animal is harmed,"" whether or not that is actually true...I pray it is), and I certainly do not pay to watch animals being literally savaged before my eyes. While I abstain from meat, I understand that animals eat other animals and I feel that to respectfully take the life of anything for the purpose of survival has its place in the world. However these animals in this film are being driven to a studio or location setting and killed for the purpose of entertainment. This film and its creators and actors are engaging in a shameful act here, and I hope they pay for it somewhere, someday."
1,I was disappointed,"I have some of Ehlert's other books and have found them to be wonderful, however, I found that this book was so very negative and had some very terrible concepts in it. Although the author portrayed activities that cats do, I was shocked to see them so boldly described in a children's book. I teach preschoolers and would not want to read this book to my class."
1,Do Not Buy this Book!,"Ugh! This book is only useful for those parents who want to buy into the ""attachment parenting"" theory hook, line and sinker. There is no objective advice to be had here-- everything is another example of the ""dont let bad advice stand in the way of a good theory."" There are many theories of parenting, and this book has picked a particularly cultish one. You will be a slave to your infant if you subscribe to these views. The first 100 pages are about ""bonding"" (the B word!) before the book gets down to any useful information about jaundice, cradle cap, bathing... etc.For opposing theories, see On Becoming Babywise or Secrets of the Baby Whisperer."
1,Clumsy and smells bad!!,Its a huge piece of heavy material which you cant really tuck in too much. And it smells horrible! The odour still remains after 2 machine washes!
1,Pointless,"This is actually a well put together movie, but, the whole thing winds up being pointless when all the build-up over approximately an hour and a half comes to an anticlimactic ending with no reason as to why any of it happened and certainly no closure on any of the questions you will have. If you have seen this movie, you already know. If you watch this movie, you will feel empty when you see the ending."
1,No De Young- No STYX-no Hits,I would have given this review 1/2 a star or was it an 1/8th Without Dennis this group is terrible!This album is all about sticking to the man who wrote most of of STYX hits! You can see why they are angry...they could not write a good or hit song. The new guy?? Please..NEXT!
1,Utter Tripe,"This book is utter crud. It is not helpful and did not shed much light on my job search. I was expecting a wealth of diversity in cover letters and resumes, instead the book offered one framework for cover letters and that makes me mad."
1,Super Tool 300 does not fit,I'm sure this is a fine case for some models but the new Super Tool 300 does not fit right as advertised. The tool is difficult to get in and out and the velcro barley latches and I doubt it will remain able to close for very long.
1,"Well, At Least She's Got A Beautiful Mind.","Miss Duff is the most phenomenal musical deity since Mozart...wait a minute, she's even greater than that lame little eighteenth-century Viennese pissant! Such towering musical magnificence comes along but once in the entire history of our pitiful species, so cherish it while you can!It's a shame, though, that she's so ghastly to look at. (Hillary, dear, you might want to consider a little plastic surgery.)"
1,"Might be a scholar of Balkans, but definitely not their son","It is simply bothersome to read something so willfully manipulated through a lens of Western superiority...the book aims to impress, rather than to convey any real historical progression. Unfortunately, many readers' opinions about the Balkans become shaped by sadly misguided pretenders, who will probably remain outsiders, no matter how long they live in a foreign place. The Balkans are quite diverse and the poor writer assumes that extrapolating from their common past under Ottoman rule he can really know them. Oh well."
1,Couldn't Finish,"The title of the book drew me as I had been on Edisto Island for a time. I am sorry to say, however, that I could not maintain interest in the book. Using a mouthful of words, the book was fluff. Did it ever go anywhere? Was this just a vignette of life? I am confused. I would read a couple of pages and follow the descriptions and then a couple of pages more, I had drifted off and could not recall what was happening. I guess I expected more. I would recommended that readers save their time and go to some other island."
1,This film belongs down the rabbit hole as far as it can go!,"I have always loved to watch anything I could find on Quantum theories or space. I was shocked how horrible this film was, I got passed a fellow saying how he planned he day and decides with his mere thoughts how his day was going to unfold, the movie was only getting an F at this point, but by the time the second person at a wedding started to engage in sex that's when my finger hit the eject button. I think that was about 30 or so mins. into the film. That's as far as I got on this film. Perhaps the film got better after where I stopped watching it. On the positive side of this film the case it came in was very attractive. Reviewed by me ray"
1,Disappointment.,"I purchased this book because I needed a grammar workbook for an 8th grade student I'm tutoring. Looking at the title of the book, the table of contents, and the brief description about the book, I figured this book would have good practice questions. It does have quite a few practice questions, but they lack variety. For examples, under ""Noun"" section it only has ""Underline all nouns in the following sentences"" questions. No student is going to enjoy doing 80 questions in that format. It's supposed to be for grades 6-10, but I don't think this goes beyond 6th grade. Spend your money elsewhere and don't waste it on this book."
1,"No Customer Service, false advertising",I did not purchase this item through Amazon. I got a postcard in the mail trying to solicit for the magazine. It advertised a price of 2.98 for a year and seemed like a great gift for my daughter. I filled out the postcard and mailed it in to start our subscription. Next thing I know I have a bill in the mail for 20 dollars and no customer service number to call. I go online and fill out the form for contact customer service (as they have no phone number to contact) and have been waiting 4 days now for someone to contact me back. I sent in a second request and I'm frustrated by not only the false price but the inability to interact with anyone about my service issue. I am sure the magazine would be loved by my daughter-but customer service is important and this magazine has NONE. Not worth the headache-no matter how great the magazine might have been.
1,Too Short!,"I can't say too much about it, but my first few impressions ruined the rest of it. The curtain was covered in powder, which I assume was to keep it from sticking to itself in the packaging, but when I put it up, it was 6 inches too short. I took the measuring tape out and sure enough, the curtain is only 90"" tall, not 96"". Beware if you needed that full height."

1,Dissapointed,I've found that wires easily come out of the plugs. The smooth slug used to compress the wires have poor grip. For some reason it seems the cap that is used to screw down onto the internal slug also easily becomes loose. I'm really disappointed and would not purchase again.
1,Disappointed with this kit,"Shipping was slower than other orders I made.The 3 in 1 Audio Video Cable passes sound OK but sending NTSC signal to a NTSC television comes up with a scrambled picture.The Travel Charger connector does not fit into the Zune, useless.The Car Charger is OK and the connector fits.This kit is not a good value at all. Recommend don't buy."
1,BAD DVD,"Well, ya get what you pay for! And ten bucks ain't gonna get ya much! Not in this case anyway. Watchable print but faded color and really BAD sound with loud buzz. But if your a West fan you better grab it. It is doubtful that this film will ever be re-stored."
1,cracks after 1 week of use,"nice set with 3 different sizes. However, these are very thin, about 1/4 inch. And sure enough, the one that I've used in the past week already cracked into half. and I only used for chopping vegetables, no heavy bangs. I knew these are cheap when I bought them, but I was hoping to be able to use them for longer than 1 week."
1,Trying to be too cool,"While watching the series I was struck by the realization that the creators were trying to be hip. Perhaps I didn't get it, but I was hoping for much more from the series."
1,Disappointed,"Recieved the item slightly before expected which was nice. However I was extremely disapointed with the kit. The ""8 gauge"" wire that came with it was very thin. I ended up using a different wire for my 1000 watt kenwood amp. Honestly an extension cord would be a better choice than this ""8 gauge"" wire. If you want a quality kit, stay away from this one."
1,A Windy Disappointment,"A very long book, that's really a medium-sized book that's been relentlessly padded to outlandish lengths. Despite his massive success, Michener's writing also suffers from an unpleasant clunkishness -- his prose is anything but elegant. Frankly, halfway through, I threw the book into the ocean."
1,Only 4 eps?,"I have really enjoyed catching bits and pieces of this series on Cartoon Network (after the excellent Home Movies) and while I'm not an animation nut (...) I think it would be very cool to have some of this because I was a huge fan of Aeon Flux when it was on Liquid Television and this series seems pretty good.But what is with only having 4 eps on a DVD?...Basically, this is the worst value I have seen since Farscape started releasing their DVDs. Disgusting, and I can see why a black market for this programming over file sharing serives has sprung up.5 stars for Reign The Conqueror. 0 stars for value. Total rating: 2 stars. 2 instead of one *only* because I'll probably still buy the first DVD so I must think it has some value."
1,"Great Plot, But ended up in the dark..........","The plot of Darkness was great, but they somehow screwed it all up. It was never scary, and it never made sence. The acting was very bad as well. I wouldn't recommend seeing this in the theater, or on VHS/DVD. The only time that would be a good time to see this movie would be on a 10 hour flight to England."
1,not as clear Pictures as my pc-cam600,"Well i just got the pc-cam880 and it should be better then the 600 but that's not so, the picture's i took with this cam notas good and clear as the pc-cam600 so i'm thinking about returning this pc-cam880."
1,Negative Stars! Avoid like flesh eating bacteria!,"""Lets jiggel the camera to show that the ground is shakeing!""Special effects; haloween leftovers.Acting; Well, the cast managed to repeat memorized lines.Casting apears to have been done in a trailer park.Script; I know nine year olds who write better stories.Cinimatography; Someones home cam.Conclusion: Anoyingly boreing and essentially unwatchable waist of time and money."
1,HOW ARE THEY FAMOUS! 0 STARS,"SERIOUSLY!- if anyone knows why is this band famous? They're got awful they are probably the most untalented band I have ever heard in my life! The guitar riffs seem as though they were written by a four year old. And the music is as creative as ""when your happy and you know it clap your hands"". There is no complexity at all to this. And I mean sometimes simplicity is great! But in this case NO! The vocals are atrocious too! I SWEAR THEY'RE CHILDREN! Okay I get it POP-PUNK is great! Just bury me in a hole until this fade dies and maturity once again is somewhere lyrically in our music.AH..."
1,Piece of crap.,"Why is Nokia still producing ""high end"" camera phones without built-in bluetooth? Because people who don't know better continue to buy them anyway. Can you imagine buying a plasma television without a remote control? This phone is lacking in memory and UI design as well. I guess the clear scrapbooking arts & craft window in the back cover is supposed to make up for all the shortcomings? Come on, Nokia. No wonder you guys are losing market share to Samsung."
1,mixed feelings,"I am not sure about the effectiveness of this book... I realize the points the authors made about how to approach the problems, what to consider and what not to consider, etc. are true. But my point is there simply isn't enough time in the real test to ""think"" like the book suggests you do. I get so bogged down trying to analyze the questions that I don't have time to finish the exam.Instead, I found that working on practice exams one after another the most effective method. In retrospect, the book wasn't a help to me."
1,WUSB54GS Poor Product,"I read the reviews and trusted them on the Linksys products. The Wireless-G Router with speed booster, the USB Network adapter with Speed booster and the internal card with speed booster do not work as they were intended. They are great if you are 10 feet away. Any further and they do not have any signal. I've called Linksys support and they tried to help but cannot help. I even invested in antenna boosters and they do not work. I was told that I have interference. I want you to know that is a crock. I feel the products are inferior and I am sorry I ever trusted them. Do not waste your hard earned money on this JUNK!!!!!!!"
1,Ridiculous,"I am giving this book 2 stars because I finished it and because it is easy to read. However, 3/4's of this ""memoir"" is fantasy and fiction. The characters are so extreme and only become more unbelievable as the book progresses. That's the only thing that'll keep your attention.The book is coarse, vulgar and disgusting."
1,Stinker,When this came out it was the first Yes album released that I didn't/wouldn't buy! I listened to it over at a buddies place and I'm almost certain the reason he bought it was to get rid of people he didn't like. This album is a chore!! Tales is just soooooo introverted and pretentious that it is the definition of self-indulgent wankery.We wrote a review of Tales for the school newspaper when it came out and it was the only time we couldn't bring ourselves to listen to the album as we were writing. Painfully boring boring boring! I honestly can't understand why anyone would like this album. Tales is without doubt as tedious as any political filibuster and to be forced to listen to this never ending album (CD) would have to be considered cruel and unusual punishment for even the most heinous crimes against society.I like Yes but this one's a real stinker!
1,Disturbing novel about being above moral law,"Have you ever done something wrong but justified it so that you wouldn't feel bad? Have you ever seen someone else do the exact same wrong thing and condemn him? In this story, the main character seems to believe that even when he does bad things he's still a ""good guy"" because ""good guys"" don't do bad things. Dizzing logic, huh? Throughout the novel, you review his senior year of high school with him. It starts out with the story of how he got the nickname ""Killer"" to why it's okay for him to take illegal drugs or break a public statue. The flashbacks of the past year are woven within the present day drama of him trying to convince a scared and angry young woman that he didn't rape her. He won't let her leave the room until she believes it. The ending is less than satisfactory for me. I would much rather the main character have received retribution and the girl receive justice."
1,Disappointment,I was excited to see all the fun music so I got suckered into buying it. What a let down! It breaks my heart because it had so much potential. I wish I could find this collection of songs only well done by the original musicians or even a good cover band.
1,Steak Knives are bogus,"Quality of everything except the steak knives is about what I would expect for a $30 set, reasonable but certainly not nice. The steak knives on the other hand do not meet even those exceedingly low expectations.The steak knives are horrible and do not match the set. Rather than matching stainless handles they have cheap badly made black plastic handles (soft easily dented plastic -- vaguely reminds me of recycled tires) and the blades are flimsy. Same construction you find in supermarket paring knives (the $1.99 for a set of 6 type).I'd sooner use the butter knives for steak."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!!!,"I purchased one of these minimotos as a birthday gift for my son and he enjoyed it so much that I went back and bought another one for my other son. After 3 months they BOTH stopped working. After purchasing a battery, troubleshooting on the phone for hours, and becoming very frustrated, I was told that I would have to replace the MOTORS MYSELF before I could get any kind of reimbursement. THIS IS A JOKE - I had to saw off a screw to even get to the battery!!! I even purchased two Toys R Us Protection Plans for $50.00 - all together a HUGE waste of $$ - 3 months of use for $199.00 is not worth it!!!!!!!!!!"
1,not worth its price,"These straw cuffs are cheap and rugged. As advertised for costume use, they should of used a material better suited for skin contact as this will annoy and irritate someone if worn for more than 10 minutes. It's better left for use as decorations on your front porch or something. If given a second chance, I wouldn't pay half price what I paid for them."
1,Smell,I bought this to keep fleas off but the smell is horrible. It smells like old person or hippies. Yuck.
1,I had no idea I was dealing with thirld world conceptions of time,"I am a new Amazon customer.Here is my history purchasing textbooks with Amazon---book 1 - normal shippingbook 2 - express shipping (at extra cost)book 2 arrived just a day before book 1, almost a week after shipping.I logically concludd that, for Amazon, shipping dates are unreliable and fluid.Therefore, for book 3, I opted for the ""free"" shipping, understanding it may takea day or two longer. Apparently, I was quite foolsih. Though I purchased it fourdays ago, it hasn't even shipped yet. Only God knows when it wil arrive.Am I supposed to believe that's acceptable?Does it really take a week just to get the thing in the mail?Amazon is looking pretty sad to me right now. Considering the priceof the textbook I bought is only inimally better than the one at my schoolbookstore, why should I deal with Amazon?I think the answer is, I will not deal with Amazon"
1,Sounds like EM put together a BAD MIXTAPE,you wouldn't want to listen to any song more than once...whole album one disappointing chuckle...and I AM AN EMINEM FAN...BUT DONT BUY THIS ALBUM...dont alow em to go PLATIUM off this trash...MAKE EM STEP HIS GAME UP FOR THE NEXT...this is wasted plastic....I THINK EMINEM RAN OUT OF IDEAS...I think he should go LIVE IN THE CONGO for 6 months or so THEN COME BACK AND DO SOME POSITIVE RAP...lol
1,Weird Clicking... then drive failed,"Had this HD for about a month now and then it started making some clicking noises and my computer locked up. Tried to reboot system and some files needed for windows to start were not found. Turned it off for a couple of days while I did some research and then tried starting it up.. It came up, so I ran ScanDisk and there were tons of errors. Drive continues to make weird clicking noises. I was able to copy my important data off of it. Will return it for another. I have had HUGE success with Western Digital in the past, so this will not make me switch to another brand, but I will not get this model again."
1,Tepid barley flavor disappointed,"I really enjoy the natural decaf property of barley tea. I normally use whole barley at home but needed bags for the office. I had brought some back from China on my last trip that I could not find in the US, so I tried this brand. These large bags are actually for a teapot, not a cup as I expected. As mentioned, the flavor was not full-bodied and so I will keep searching."
1,american theory of forgetting,"from all indications, mr tolle makes money with his vacuous pronouncements: far be it from me to put him down. however... as with infomercials promising the secret of effortless millions, there's no way around the paradox of first premises, eg, if you really know the secret of effortless money, why are you working so hard to convince me to send $19.95 right now? or, in tolles's case, if you've achieved selflessness, why are you so discordantly singing this song of yourself?historically, spiritual masters don't say much. christ, if you believe the gospels, said very little. alternatively, people most exquisitely burdened by self tend to publish prolifically. after all, you can't spell 'creativity' without 'e,' 'g,' and 'o.' (although, really, 'g' and 'o' are superfluous; still, of what use is it to remark here that you cannot spell 'boogie' without 'e,' 'g,' and 'o?')"
1,It's a 2.5 hour GM commercial!,"So let me get this straight... i just spent two and a half hour watching a GM commercial with mediocre actors, unrealistic 'transformations' of robots (although the digital effects are superb but once you've seen the first one it gets old).... and I had to pay for this.The acting was horrible -- the cars not much to look at and the robots all look the same to me. The story predictable. Again, this was about the first few robot transformation... don't waste your time/money on this!"
1,Mac OS X,After doing about 4 hours of research in trying to manually set this up for Mac OS X - I finally threw in the towel and got rid of this thing. There was a long string of blog posts that people had been working on for years. I decided that the headache was not worth the cost. Sorry Linksys but big fail on this one.
1,Beware the Haunted Mansion,"The game is actually a pretty good concept and kind of fun. Plus, it has the bonus of going pretty quickly. Unfortunately, it is made so cheaply (overpriced!) that at times it is almost impossible to play. First off, the game board is small, so it is even hard for smaller hands to move the pieces on the back of the lower lever. Then the snakey stairs fall off continually. Plus, they are so shaky that the characters fall off almost every move which is a complete pain. Once you make it above the snakey stairs, the rest of the game is OK. Assembly is very easy. Our ghost didn't pop up properly at first, but now works fine. Beware - your kids will want to press down the ghost all the time. I don't see this game lasting long without breaking."
1,pedometer,ACCUSPLIT Eagle AE1640M4 Step and Distance Pedometerthis is the first product i have brought from amazon that i did not like the description of product did not say how fragile the product is only reference was made on how small the buttons were i could have dealt with the small buttons if the product would have not fallen apart so easily the only good thing about this product was the little loop to attach to your belt loops i will have to buy another pedometer but will buy a much more sturdier one i would suggest that this product be overhauled and upgraded the
1,Doesn't Get Anywhere,"This movie doesn't really get anywhere. There is no pivotal moments or climaxes. It has a few funny scenes, but overall I kept waiting for something significant to happen and it never did."
1,WARNING: You get what you pay for,"I was very skeptical about this cable given the low price, but most of th reviews were favorable. It does not work with my brand new Pioneer 1080 upconvert DVD player. I went to best buy ang fot one for $20, that works just fine. It tried it with my friend's player, still no signal. There is no return label and I will probably end up paying more in return that it was worth in the first place. Stick to known brands that this low quality stuff!!"
1,Toxic and biased.,"This book only shows the dark side of John Belushi. A good alternative to this book is SAMURAI WINDOW by John's widow, someone who actually KNEW Belushi, not a journalist such as Mr. Woodward. Woodward saw Belushi only as a get drunk do drugs sort of guy, but he had a very soft and tender side to him that only his true friends and family could tell about."
1,Too big,"I had a bad experience with this product but that is due to the vendor. When the product arrived, it smelled and was super dusty. I could not stand it!! I also thought it was too wide for my taste!"
1,Too small,"Unless you have wrists like a small child, these are crap. I would not recommend these to friends. TOO SMALL!"
1,"Lots of info, but who is this book for?","If you don't know your mouse from an iptable, I wouldn't recommend buying this book. While it is chock full of info, the majority of it seems geared to more hardcore power users. The book starts off slow and easy, but then suddenly everything is in command-land. I still find it handy as a reference, but it isn't really isn't a good book for beginner or intermediate users."
1,A piece of felt and a wrapping paper roll,This was by far the worst item I've ever purchased on the internet. This was literally just a piece of green felt and a cardboard roll with a strap. The box that contained these items was all torn up when it arrived and looked like it had been opened 100 times. Please save your money and do not purchase this item.
1,Zircon circuit finder makes no sound,"This is the second one I have gotten with the same problem. I sent the first one back, and it was exchanged very quickly by Amazon, because when it would find the right breaker, it would light up, but not make a sound. Now I have gotten the second one and it does the same thing. I have emailed Zircon and asked them about it, but they seem to ignore my emails. I don't know what to do, it works with the light, but it does not make a sound like all the literature says it should. That includes the paperwork I got with the unit. Not a problem with Amazon, who gave me splendid service but with Zircon, who won't even answer my inquiries about the unit."
1,DOES NOT LIVE UP TO HARVEY'S OTHER WORK!,"By Reason of Insanity and Mental Case were fast paced and held your interest, but Dead Game was to drawn out and boring. I really liked the Ben Tolliver character and couldn't wait to read this book, however I was greatly disappointed. The story line was weak and the ending was totally unbelievable!"
1,BORING,"This would have to rate as one of the most boring songs of the 80's. Just about every CD that would classifies as 'retro' has this sorry excuse for a riff on it. Its the sort of song that could be easily replicated by any 4 year old on a speak-and-spell. This is not a song for listening to, it should be avoided and forgotten."
1,Garbage,"Pros:1. Anybody that can complete a 100 mile run has my respect whether he can write or not.2. When he chooses to actually write about running every 25 pages or so, it is pretty good.3. This one cracks me up - when he goes from the garbage stuff to the running stuff, he changes type faces. It's more of a bold font. His writing is still pathetic, but at least he tells me where the better stuff is.Cons1. This book isn't about running, its about some sort of religion thing. Running is just his means of talking about his religion thing.2. I just finished reading Dean Karnazes book, Ultra Marathon Man. What a terrific book: short sweet and to the point. Then I pick up this piece of trash. How depressing ! Dean's book just made this ""book"" appear that much worse"
1,Believe the Reviews,We usually enjoy the jokes and sense of humor of George Lopez but not this time. We were not offended by any part of it but did not have the gut-busting laughs he usually provides.
1,SHAMELESS: THE COMPLETE SECOND SEASON,i'm STILL waiting to receive it since Xmas!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I can't seem to track it and don't know who to send an email to????????????can you help track this down????????????
1,MISTAKE! Do NOT Buy This Product!!,"This router worked for just over a year; I just spent almost an hour troubleshooting with them on the phone, only for them to tell me that it has ""gone bad"" and there is nothing they can do about it!!! I asked to speak to a supervisor, and they still refused to help. They acknowledged that their product went bad but said because it had been more than a year (2 months over a year), they are not liable.I will never buy another Netgear product again, and I am filing a claim with my credit card company (GO AMERICAN EXPRESS! At least THEY were sympathetic and are going to refund my money)."
1,"Film didn't pass, really flunked.","This film had every chance in the world to make a meaningful statement about racial prejudice and threw each one away. Sonja Wilde's part, where she is obviously white or pale, is not very believable when she tells an employer she is part black so she can't get a job. James Franciscus overacts as her racist husband, but his script is at fault. The story needed some compelling event where she could admit she was part black and he could try to accept it (ex. the baby lived and resembled him as the real father) but instead he only rants and raves that she shouldn't socialize with black people. A bit too long where our bride must lie about her black father with no DVD extras to relieve the tedium."
1,Battery Eaters,"RiteLite Wireless Twelve LED Under Cabinet Light #LPL700This product's description was pretty sketchy but I went ahead and ordered three of them, hoping they would work out for a display case project I was working on. To get an idea of how long the batteries would last, I set up a test using a photographic light meter. I opened one light and and inserted 6 fresh AAA batteries. After only three hours on high, the light output had dropped by 75%! At that light level this unit would have been useless for my needs, not to mention the number of batteries I would go through. Product returned."
1,Supertooth II microphone volume too low,I was thrilled when I first received this Bluetooth Speakerphone. I had no problems pairing it with my Cingular RAZR V3. It worked as expected the first couple of weeks I had it except after about 1 week the bright metal speaker cover dropped off. I superglued it back in place. Then after another week or so I received complaints that I could hardly be heard. I can find no mention in the manual of a way to increase the microphone sensitivity.I've been through reseting the phone and re-pairing it withthe cellphone but I still can't be heard.What a disappointment... I guess it's back to my old Motorola HS-850 Headset!Jack MacBlueAnt Bluetooth Portable Handsfree Supertooth II Handsfree Speakerphone
1,Auto-renewal bug,"Ordered Time in March 2011 with auto-renewal. In December 2011 received an e-mail notifying me that my subscription would be automatically renewed. That was fine so I did nothing. Today I received 2 copies of Time, one with a subscription ending March 2012 and one with a subscription ending December 2012. OBVIOUSLY AUTO-RENEWAL DOES NOT WORK CORRECTLY!!!"
1,"Second time I was sent a ""Blue-Ray"" copy that I can't watch","I saw this film on the airplane on way to Canada. I thought it would be great to share with friends in my village home in France. It is a great look at the diversity of Canada. I ordered it when I was in Canada in March. Unfortunately it arrived in Blue-Ray version. I didn't know I ordered it that way. I don't have that system. I returned the video. When I got back to France I ordered it once again and once again it came in ""Blue-Ray"" version. Totally useless. It sits on the shelf beside me because I got frustrated and didn't return it. So....how to get what you want and not what the system thinks you should have. I do not want to buy a new DVD player."
1,Bad disc,"Discs # 1,2,5,6 are not working.My DVD player is region free.Also tried from my computer with several different programs...some said there was an issue with the disc copyright."
1,Poor execution of an interesting concept,"Sable Island is undoubtably a fascinating subject, and so it must take an exceptional talent to write such a uniformly dull book about it. I bought this book on a whim hoping it would live up to the mild acclaim paraded on the cover, but I've had to force myself to finish it over the last few days. The previous reviewer is spot-on regarding the topics covered, but he fails to mention that De Villiers managed to leach almost every ounce of interest from them. The only spark of vitality comes from other writers who De Villiers quotes extensively and to his own detriment. The book also lacks any sense of organization and I found myself repeatedly puzzled over how the chapters, not to mention the contents of the chapters, were supposed to be tied together."
1,You Mean To Tell Me This Isnt A Live Album???,"I was excited about getting this CD because I thought it was a live recording and I haven't heard much of Europe live before. The disappointment when I found out it wasn't live, just yet ANOTHER!!!! compilation by this band. Don't get me wrong I love Europe to bits and they have written many great albums and amazing songs over the years, buy why, why, why all of the compilations?? Just get Rock The Night or 1982 - 1992, they are better compilations than this cheap waste of a CD."
1,Rapidly sinking,"This is the second in a series by Jan Needle. I bought the first three books together, since I've exhausted the Alexander Kent series, and wanted some more sea-faring adventure. The first book was sort of poor, but I forged on to this, the second. This one is so bad that I'm not going to bother with the third book, just pack it off to the used book store.There is plenty of angst and misery in this tale, not to mention a number of characters that are quite unbelievable. But the plot, and the writing, are a lot closer to Barbara Cartland than they are to C.S. Forester. I wasted my money - don't waste yours."
1,Not worth the money,"This product isn't any better than the 10 year old curling brush I have under my bathroom sink. The kind girls used to feather their hair. It's a hairbrush that blows hot hair. Not at all what I thought it was going to be. You are better off going to the drugstore and getting a hot air styler ,some with changeable brushes for 10 to 15 dollars."
1,Just another hateful film against the a Catholic Saint,"Anyone who has read 'the Story of a Soul' knows that St. Therese was not a neurotic 'basketcase', as this film would have you beleive. This film is just another cheap shot at Catholic bigotry and I think 1 star is far too generous a rating for it.Read and reread the book but don't waste your money on a film like this."
1,"OK for filters, doesn't explain extensions","On the positive side, the book does describe how ISAPI filters work.On the negative side, it doesn't explain at all how ISAPI extensions work (and most will write far more extensions than filters). ALL of the stuff on ISAPI extensions is built on MFC or Delphi code, which aim to hide the mechanics from the programmer. The issue of how ISAPI extensions work is waved off by the author as drudgery. Drudgery it may be, but it is the topic the book claims to address but doesn't.I would give the book one star rating out of sheer frustration with the extensions material, but some would find the filter stuff useful, so I'm forgoing a completely negative review."
1,Disappointed will not buy another.,"I purchased this Keurig B60 Special Edition Brewing System in May 2010. It functioned as expected for the first 12 months. (Only used on weekends about 5 cups per week). After about twelve months of use (using only filtered or bottled water)and following the manufacturer's cleaning maintenance suggestions it started to malfunction. At first it started to regurgitate the water back into the resevoir and would shut itself off or not come on at all. The display would dim and the set-up menu would appear and freeze up. After following the trouble shooting guide and on-line trouble shooting suggestions it's performance did not improve. Needless to say after reviewing many of the negitive comments (which sound a lot like mine) it is obvious, that to this company it is better business to build and promote an inferior product than to invest in research and development to create a longer lived product. So in a nutshell...they want your money not your satisfaction."
1,"BAD DVD, OVERRATED MOVIE","For some reasons I have never been able to get into this film. I find it's madcap antics way too over the top for my taste. Roz Russell and Cary Grant are fine but I have found it impossible to follow the rapid-fire story. Perhaps if we were given a decent DVD transfer, fully restored, I would change my mind. The DVD is so bad its almost unwatchable. This may be the reason I have never been able to get into this movie because the film quality is so poor. This is a film in dire need of restoration because it cannot be fully appreciated. (Just a warning......any time you see a classic film in the bargain bin without the ""Turner"", ""Warner"", ""UNIVERSAL"" or ""20th Century Fox"" trademark, it is a generic DVD and the quality will be poor. A few others like this......""Penny Serenade, Meet John Doe, A Farewell to Arms""), etc."
1,No 800 Phone support,"The other reviews did not mention these problems.There is no 800 Phone support from HP. After being left on hold for over 30 minutes it became obvious that HP was not going to support help me on the instalation problem I was having, the Ink Carriage would not center for loading of ink. Three hours to install a printer!There was no documentation that stated that you cannot write to the Memory Card. To get high quality scans you must run a seperatre program. Both were key reasons for buying this product. Also, to network this printer or to use parallal cable requires very expesive attachment.Still looking at the other features work, but will probably return this by the end of the week."
1,Don't judge Crais by this effort,"Robert Crais has written several Elvis Cole novels, which I have read and immensely enjoyed. He has always mixed a good measure of humor with the serious elements of his plots and his characters and made it work. Elvis Cole and Joe Pike are the best detective duo since Spenser and Hawk were created. Maybe better. This book is something else altogether. It has a dark plot and even darker characters. The bombers, bombing victims and bomb squad detectives that people this novel are collectively a sad bunch of misfits, cretins, liars and losers. They are all basically unlikable and the distinction between the good guys and the bad guys is blurred. I managed to struggle through Demolition Angel, but if this were the first novel by Robert Crais I doubt that I would ever read another. Fortunately, I know for a fact that Crais is one of the very top fiction writers out there, and I will no-less-eagerly await his next effort."
1,There must be other ways to do this,"Looking at Hugh Wilson (the show's creator) and Fox's comments, it seems like they missed an important point to the show - that the music is one of the characters and is integral to the show. They also seem to feel that they can only sell the show at $30.It's unfortunate that they didn't pass the rights onto Rhino or Shout and let them work through the licensing issues and release it under their brand titles.My guess is that they may look at this option in the future, so vote with your wallet and send a message to Fox."
1,Not universal for Joovy strollers!,"I bought this for our Joovy Ergo Caboose and it doesn't fit--perhaps there's fine print in the literature stating as much, but wish I had known before I went to the trouble of ordering it. Looks like a nice organizer--too bad it is going back to Amazon, and I'm going back to the drawing board."
1,soy and fructose,"i have used this protein powder in the past because it was made from whey not soy. now soy is listed as well which, if not organic, is almost definitely genetically engineered-a cheap protein source. whey to go is not cheap and solgar should get rid of the GE soy and use only whey. in addition fructose is the second ingredient. i am now looking for a quality whey protein powder with less sugar."
1,Confusion?,"All I read in the reviews is how this is a great cd, but I listened to it and heard the same music thats been played on the radio for the lastg 3 years! ORIGINALITY...... thats what they need.. I can't stand listening to the way this cd reminds me of the last song or song on another cd. Its disappointing to think that this cd is popular due to the fact that all the girls like them and they have 2 singers who can actually sing. They wont always be young and if they plan on staying around they need to find talent or come original because they are doing little of each right now"
1,An unauthorized book of Oprah Winfrey quotes.,"Bill Adler has taken past interviews, articles, and speeches of Oprah Winfrey and complied _his list_ of her best quotations. It's an unauthorized book - meaning Oprah didn't write it nor was she involved in the production. Some quotations show the source of information with a date and some don't -- which makes it a bit disappointing not to have the history or context pertaining to the quote. If you have an extensive Oprah collection, you'll want this book just to say you have everything, otherwise there are many other good Oprah biographies available."
1,This book sucks!,"I bought this book on the basis of the author's name. I've been reading Larry Niven for 20 years and have come to expect quality hard science fiction with interesting plot lines. This book was a real disappointment. Against my better judgement, I kept reading hoping for the story to develop. It never happened. The plot in this book is a series of barely connected vignettes written solely to stroke the egos of some superweirdos that attend science fiction conventions. The atrocious writing made me doubt that the book was even written by Larry Niven. Money spent on this book might as well have been dropped into a black hole"
1,"Good book, Bad Publisher","Publishers who turn off text to speech should be boycotted. Customers who have bought the text should be able to process however they choose. Those with visual impairment are being persecuted. This is a good book, whose quality is tarnished by the publisher."
1,its been said perfectly before...,"Squash 'n squeek a couple of guys behind me has said it the best, this album is the most overrated of all time. I think that the reason that it is popular is because Guns 'N Roses made a genre like Metal more tangible in the public eye, when there where many more talented metal artists out at the time, before, as well as after. I do not think that they have enough talent as musicians to be considered so great. They made songs with some good aspects that I feel are way overclouded with the bad ones (and there are a lot!). They are just drug addicts with no substance to theie musc, and they have maybe one or two decent songs. I'm sorry but this gets a one star review in my book."
1,Where's Brad?,"Sorry, Tom, you weren't Boston all by yourself. It's like going to your hometown and not seeing Fenway, the Museum of Fine Arts, Cheers, the Ducklings, or the public market."
1,Dreadful,"This film is the mirror image/evil twin of the clasic, inspired, brilliant ""Young Frankenstein"" - deadly unfunny and dull, with Leslie Nielsen completely miscast. I laughed one time during the entire film. A sad latter-day film by the brilliant Mel Brooks, and a far cry from ""Young Frankenstein"", ""Blazing Saddles"", ""History of the World Part I"" and ""High Anxiety"". Avoid at all costs."
1,Painful experience,"Muddled and painful to watch. Actors self indulgent orgy of experimentation into shock, without any redeeming value. Wish I could get the time back."
1,Went from Good To Bad,"I had high hopes for this fairly priced box fan. Although, when I turned it on the fan fell forward, plastic blade hit front grill and broke. Contacted Amazon, they directed me to maker of the fan, emailed them, no response since. Its been weeks. So now I have a box fan with a broken blade. Not a happy Amazon customer."
1,GARBAGE,"I had listed to Dio since he was with black sabbath. I liked his strong voice and beleived that Dio has the best voice among the hard rock bands. Dio during 80's was my best. What happened to the man and his band with this album? No music, no voice. Has he listed to it befor releasing it? Is this really Dio? I believe he is unable to produce any good material for this album is the wosrt that I ever heard in my life. Ronnie, it is the time for you to retire."
1,General Chemistry 7th ed,I bought the book titled General Chemistry 7th ed by whitten(sp?)peck and stanley yet I was shipped the study guide to text instead>make sure you use the isbn(cant go wrong with that).
1,Husain is a coward,"Husain depicts Hindu icons in the nude. I don't really have a problem with nudity or sex depictions per se, but he also shows Seetha on Ravana's thigh, naked, gods having sex with animals and other strange stuff. But the key thing is that his family members are shown fully clothed, as is Muhammad's (the prophet's) wife. He probably knows that if he dared to show Amina or whoever naked, there would be an immediate fatwa on him!"
1,PIECE of JUNK !,"Junk, junk, junk.Thank heavens Amazon has such wonderful customer service.Myself as well as one of my friends purchased this so called food processor. We felt we researched it well BUT.......on the second use (shredding cheese) it fused together, forever.This seems to be a constant problem, which Kitchen Aid will not admit. They refused to take it back! Look at customer reviews on the KitchenAid website.We purchased Cuisinart, works great."
1,What I received is NOTHING like the picture!!,"I feel totally ripped off by these people. I ordered this tea set, but when I opened up the box, what I got was actually a different Princess tea set (the pink one with Princess Aurora on it). Not only was it NOT the set I ordered for my daughters birthday, but I was charged for this one ($35.99) and the one I have has a price tag hanging on it with a retail price of $14.50 (2 and 1/2 times the retail price!!). I could have bought the one I received for $14.50 at Walmart and not paid for shipping. Shame on BLACK SHEEP DEALS."
1,GWTW sequel does not measure up.,"I enjoyed reading the book, but was disappointed by the mini-series. I found the cast lackluster, failing to inspire the passion of GWTW. The terrible attempts to imitate Irish and Southern accents were distracting."
1,this cd is a scam,"Although he is pictuted on the cover and with the same picture on the disc, James Taylor does not appear on this CD. There are no liner notes whatsoever in this CD. Only the list of Song titles and times. This CD is a complete fake and a total rip-off. DO NOT BUY IT!!!!!"
1,Two thumbs down - way down!,"This book was in one word - boring. It talks about the first academy awards...blah, blah, blah...and then the latest. The book is filled with usless babble that isn't even worth knowing! Listen people - DO NOT waste your money buying this book and/or your time reading this book! What a wasteful piece of crap..."
1,"Bad documentation, ok product.","Let me first point out that [...], whom I bought this from, is a great company. I bought this product, it shipped very quickly, and when I couldn't get it to work (see below), they were very quick and courteous to issue a fully pre-paid RMA shipping label. I highly recommend[...]; excellent support, very quick turnaround.Now the print server itself appeared to be ready to work out of the box. However, it just failed to recognize my HP LaserJet 1020. Also, the software packaged with the device was flat out broken. It was impossible to assign a static IP to the device, and I had to search Buffalo's website to find a ""new"" package. The package finally allowed me to assign a static IP. However, the printer was still offline. The Buffalo tech support was fairly quick to respond to my issue (within 24 hours), but they weren't terribly helpful. I ended up having to return the product."
1,Yet another product designed by the accounting and marketing department,"This product is not as described. It is not mid-length (it's somewhere between low rise and mid-rise) and the elastic in the legs is thin and weak--it most certanly rides up your legs into your crotch. Moreover the waistband is a thick material that will add girth to your waist and make your pants fit tighter, and the fabric itself is too thick/fuzzy and uncomfortably hot (it retains moisture) in a normal office environment. Another pair of underwear that does not perform. Do the executives at these companies actually wear their products? I guess not. I gave it two stars because it makes a decent, if somewhat expensive, rag."
1,ILLEGAL,This appears to be an illegal dub from China. The simpsons have not released more than 10 seasons on DVD yet. Do not support this pirate by buying this garbage.update: it seems like the seller has changed this product. My review was made when it was a bootlegged simpsons dvd set.
1,Wait for paperback if you have to have it,"It defintely is a change from the previous posleen books. They were all action and violence, while this one is more subtle and delves into the main character's psyche a lot more. The major problem i have with it is the cost. It's just not long enough to justify spending 25 or even 16 dollars on it. And I just couldnt get into this idea of having a spy take the role and the body of another person. Its too convient."
1,Problems reading the different cards,"Daughter received this as a gift. The concept is nice since she loves to touch my grown up laptop, but the laptop does not effectively ""read"" the different cards that are included. Disappointing to me, but she'll still love using the one card that it does read!"
1,Stopped working within 18 months,Everything about this radio is solid for the price but it has relatively lousy reception. I live in FL so I will keep it for the next hurricane. (handcrank feature) If I needed it daily i would have had to return it. Adddendum: It stopped working 18 months later.
1,Arthur's Eyes by Justina,"Arthur's Eyes was a good example of how your treated when you look different from others. Although everyone is the same and equal, and thats how the teacher treated Arthur,equally."
1,IR blaster port doesn't work.,"After carefully reading theinstructions and setting the unitup, I was unable to get it tocontrol my Echostar (dish network)reciever via the IR port.Further troubleshooting witha highly infrared sensitive camerashows NOTHING ever comes out of theinfrared blaster LED's.Since I never got an answer backfrom my email request to their(offshore) tech support, I'm returningthe unit for a refund."
1,"Contrived, deliberate, and just tries too hard.........","You dont really need to listen to this album to know what to expect. You have a retro-seventies album cover and a wanna-be throwback. I admire Donavon as a surfer, but just because you surf doesnt mean you can be just as creative musically.Most of these tracks have one single common denominator, they are contrived, deliberate and boring. Musically, they have been done before and you can name a band from the 60's or 70's that influenced that song. Why not do a Scott Walker song cover? That may break up the boredom on this album. It may be mellow- but it has no soul. The music sounds forced and the lyrics dont flow well. I think being star struck is what has given him great reviews. Keep surfing Donavon and tell your sponsors it just a side gig. Look for this one in your favorite used CD section."
1,"Worthless junk, won't install drivers","Don't bother with this junk. I tried this on both a Win 7 Pro 64 bit and Vista Home Premium 32 bit machine. Neither would install the drivers, so this device never showed up under My Computer. Therefore, it's worthless as you can't access anything on your hard drive. There is no manufacturer listed on the package, and since no name is given the drive under device manager, you can't even go search for a driver anywhere. I even tried to manually install it as a generic USB mass storage device and that also failed. Oh well, it's only $5 wasted. Don't waste your $5 and buy this garbage. I'd give it zero stars if that were an option."
1,I simply don't like this case at all. Go for case logic instead.,"I have a case logic with my canon sd600 and I like that case a lot as it looks nice, padded, easy access, holds battery and sd card, etc. It was the perfect case. I got this canon case for free with my canon sd1200. It's terrible. First, I have to take off my belt to put it through the case. Second, it doesn't hold anything but the camera. No battery or extra sd card. Third, it doesn't seem as protective as other cases. Lastly and my biggest problem is that it is way too tight. The camera is like jammed in there and I have tightly squeeze my thumb and fingers to pull it of the case. That means I am getting thumb prints on the screen and accidently pressing buttons. I love cannon products but this is their first bad review from me. The camera is much better then the case."
1,Lasted about Three Months,"I bought this vacuum in November. At first it seemed to work really well, then yesterday, suddenly, the sound of the motor became quieter, and it no longer would suck up anything!I thought I must have been too rough on it, then I read here that others have had a similar problem!The machine had gotten very hot to the touch, although I had only used it for 3 or 4 minutes.Very disappointing! I won't buy this again.I'm surprised-I thought Hoover was a good brand."
1,dismal,"I finished this at 11 pm and almost got up to write a review to warn others. Absolutely dismal. It's unfortunate, though, because this writer does seem to have talent but the characters are stagnant, the plot is drawn out far too long and the ending! I actually kept turning pages to see if where the rest of it was! It's like she ran out of enthusiasm for the story and just decided to kill off the storyline.That being said, if the author worked a storyline with more ease and CONCLUDED the story instead of abandoning it, I think there is potential - just not this book. Shudder. Can't wait to return the book to the library. (Donnette and Ellis are so unlikable!!! - NO GROWTH!)"
1,Boring,"I read on average 4-5 novels a month however, this book I couldn't get thru the first few chapters. It was like trying to get out of quick sand to force myself to continue on HOPING it would become interesting. I just couldn't do it!"
1,I can SEE that the water isn't clean...,"I really should've read these reviews first, but I just bought this model from Walmart. Our water well developed a leak today, so I bought this filter pitcher to use until its fixed. The water from the faucet is pretty reddish/brown from rust leaking into the tank, but the water in the filtered part of the Brita is still at least 50% as reddish/brown. So apparently the Brita is great at removing miniscule microscopic elements from water, but it can't remove rust and/or dirt? What a waste, going right back to Walmart."
1,Low Battery- DEFECT!?!!,"I am not the only one. After using this camera for maybe 6 months, and being annoyed by the delay between pictures, now the darn thing won't even power up! I've replaced battery after battery, and wondered, are ALL the batteries in my house dead (taken from remotes, CD players, MP3 players, you name it)? But now I see, it's some sort of defect. Is there any remedy? I didn't purchase a warranty. Even if I had it would have expired. It seems that this problem occurs after a certain amount of usage. I would recommend against this camera, if not for the delay in pictures, then for the fact that after 6 months it is useless. What a waste of money. NO MORE NIKON for me!"
1,THE WORST FILM!,This is absolutely by far the worse film I have ever watched (endured is more like it).
1,Broken Latch -- Lousy Service,"We had this camera for a few weeks, it took mediocre pictures. Then the flimsey plastic latch to the battery compartment broke. This is an amazingly cheap flaw for a (supposedly) good brand. Anyway, we mailed it in to be fixed to an Olympus repair center in NY and are still waiting to get it back (3 weeks later). At this point I'm not sure I care if I get it back or not. I'm already looking at other cameras. Update: I got a letter from Olympus informing me that the problem is not under warranty and it will cost $100.70 to fix what is probably a $0.10 plastic latch. No thank you. Guess whose products I am never going to buy again? I am also going to plaster this review on any consumer website I can find. Smart move Olympus!"
1,Not received,"I believe it is a good recording, but I am still waiting for it to arrive.Looking forward to it."
1,It's a good way to make money! Write a book like this!!!,"...I like this book! I thing it is just a PRETTY BOOK to add to your library shelves or to place it on your coffee table to show that (yes I got this book!) which is highly publitized, and it is in your face whenever you log to any book selling websites or in every major bookstore. A brief history of time is definitly a better book to read and Mr. Hawking shoud stick to that type of science and writing . I'd describe this book as fancy magazine you'd look at the pictures and you'd read some interesting titles or few paragraghes- waiting in doctor's office and when your name is called you'd just put it down and forget about it..."
1,Something to watch,"So I got this due to the ratings and reviews. I made alot of sense, but is not a movie. It has scenes in it and then people comment on it the scene. I could of done without alot of comments, just some here and there would of been better. Overall the scenes were good."
1,wizard scalp massager,"this particular scalp massager doesn't do what i thought it would. you cant seem to bend the forks the way you want them. i'm sure there are better ones out there, but i didn't really like this one."
1,Mouse worked only for a short period,"This was a really nice mouse....everything I expected! However, its lifespan left me with a lot to be desired....not even 2 months past before this item just quit working. Now I am forced to purchase something new once again. Perhaps this item is still under its warranty, but prior experience with those situations led me to write this review instead. ""Word of mouth"" is a very powerful tool for consumers to alert others of inferior and defective products!"
1,Not Bound Correctly,"I just received this book I ordered for my Grandson. It is not bound correctly as the pages are 1/4 of an inch above the book cover. It is also a small book, not the big full sized book I expected. This is the first time I am really disappointed in the Quality of this product.Hop on Pop"
1,not good,I bought this thinking that it doesn't come with the purchase of Kindle. now I have 2 and absolutely useless. Kindle keeps on coming out from it as it doesn't have corners on all four sides. I have dropped it once already but now I have purchased another case by M.Edge.
1,Buyer beware,"This review is not regarding the actual film itself, but rather the poor quality of this DVD release.The transfer used on this ""25th Anniversary Edition"" DVD is of VHS quality. The colors are extremely dull and washed out, and it's clear that the print did not come from a film source.This is quite surprising considering the transfer used on the Trimark DVD released way back in 1998 did come from a good looking film print! That is still the version to get if you're seeking the best looking transfer available on DVD.The 5.1 audio mix used is also quite generic. It has no extra depth over the original 2.0 mix, and even sounds ""tinny"" in a fake sort of way.They've also shoved all of the bonus material onto a single-layer disc, and thus compression artifacts are often very noticeable.The bonus features on the disc are interesting, but nothing to scream home about. And you can find all of these features on the previous ""Collector's Edition"" that this same DVD studio released in 2005."
1,"A good resource, impossible read","This book was a required textbook for a Germanic linguistics class I had just recently. Forget about any sort of enjoyable reading, like some textbooks. No, this one does not qualify as ""engrossing."" Rather, though chock-full of linguistical information including an interesting chapter on German spelling reforms, the book is written in a scientific, flat, shall I say ""boring?"" and distincly British fashion. It has the feeling it was written in the 1940s or 1950s, and I was surprised to find it was written in 1994.If you have a short, or even medium-length, attention span, I'd recommend finding backup tutoring, because you will have trouble reading this one cover-to-cover. Its unfortunate, because the information contained therein has potential to fascinate, but written about in such style has little potential to motivate one to puruse further into the world of linguistics. In a word: awful!"
1,JUNK!,"Other than being poorly constructed, the product's packaging was little more than a paper cover which was the cause for it being broken in three places when I received it."
1,AWFUL!!!!!!!!!!!,"I have one of these new made in China Cobra 148 GTLs and it is NOTHING like the older ones made back in the early 1990s and late 1980s. Mine quit less than 24 hours after obtaining it. No transmit and no receive... Nothing. Now i have to get it fixed... What a joke! Cobra used to be a top name in CB circles and now they have made a bad name for themselves. Of course Uniden no longer makes anything for Cobra anymore... I hate to say it but Cobra better get thier act together or they will go the way of Robyn, Teaberry, Lafayette, and a few others into the dustbin of CB history... I wouldnt touch one of these loser radios with a 10 foot pole!!! STAY AS FAR AWAY FROM THIS LEMON AS POSSIBLE!!!!!!"
1,Indistinct indie,2 1/2This quality of output will impress only if low expectations are a starting point.
1,You'll be sorry,Uninstalled this peice of garbage today. This game definately does not live up to the hype. Is it better than Thunder 04? maybe. Is it a realistic Nascar sim? NO. If your looking for a Sim Nascar Game buy anything made by Papyrus Racing Games. From Nascar 4 to Nascar 2003. They are not perfect but they are way closer than this. I really had my hopes up that EA would get it right this time but once again they fell way short. EA has exclusive rights to Nascar Sims now and since there is no competition they don't have to worry about making anything better. I've been racing online for 4 years and playing racing games for several years before that. If your looking for a new racing game even if it's not a Nascar game for the PC look elsewhere GTR and R Factor come to mind as games that show way more promise than this one.
1,"Very comfy for first few minutes, then not so much","I have been having foot pain and bought these to wear around the house so I don't have to walk on bare tile/wood floors. My hope was that the memory foam would provide good support for my feet - but it did not. I felt like a thin layer on top of the soles of the slippers and there was no arch support at all. After wearing the slippers for an hour, my feet hurt more than when I before I put them on. Your mileage may vary."
1,it is very small,Everything has been excellent. But I have been dismiss the watch's dimensions. It is pretty too much but my wife has been like big case.therefore we have disappointed...
1,NOT THE BEST,"Parts of the movie were okay, but there were parts that were so mind-numbingly dumb I couldn't believe it. Take for instance all of the dumb cops standing in front of an all glass elevator, holding pictures of the intended victim and they are looking every which way but their gaze seems to bypass the glass elevator that the victim is standing in looking right at them....duh. Also, hi could they make Marisa Tomei look worse??? She is a pretty woman and they have her looking terrible. James Spader was very good. I'd never watch it again."
1,Fragile,"This racquet was absolutely amazing for the 10 weeks that I was able to use it. After playing about once a week for 10 weeks it started to splinter just above the handle on one side. I taped the fracture and played one more time before it finally cracked all the way through. I consider myself an intermediate squash player, and I take good care of my equipment. I payed about $120, and I got about 12 plays out of it. $10/play = unacceptable. I gave this racquet 2 stars because it was an amazing racquet while it lasted. I am going to contact customer service to see if I can get a replacement. Take a look at my photos, and you will see what I mean."
1,DOA,"Not working on receipt. Returned to sender. Replacement not available: alternate watch suggested.Very disappointed: there are no other alarm, analogue watches with this elegant design, that I can find."
1,How to make 81 minutes seem like a lifetime.,"This film may only last 81 minutes but it will challenge your whole idea of perception. It seems at least twice as long, as dreary and repetitive scenes follow endlessly. Poorly directed with no linear development and poorly focussed dingy interiors.More like reality TV from the E channel than a movie.Sorry, I know the major players should command more respect..."
1,I wish I could recommend this one but I can't,"I put this DVD on and within the first 15 minutes I said huh?! Wait a minute...who are these people and what's going on here? This is low budget, thrown together, amateur stuff. Story continuity is somewhat missing; in fact the story is somewhat missing. It has It's cute moments that the kids may get a charge out of. There are some attempts at comedy. You'll see some familiar places that will amuse you if you have ever been to Tweetsie Railroad and the North Carolina mountains. Would I get it again?... No way unless the kids just begged for it."
1,Headband not fastened well,Tiara looked nice but the band that keeps it on broke the first time my daughter tried to wear it.
1,Not appropriate for an Office,"I bought 6 of these cameras for our various offices and they are very noisy. They move alot, but due to the noise they make one would not be able to use them in an office environment. When they move back and forth they don't really focus at the person who activated the motion sensor, so that appeared to be very unrealistic. Their appearance from a distance might fool some, but they look very much like a toy."
1,Would not recommend ...,These shirts are a great price. My husband is a 4xlt and with one wash they shrunk drastically. Mostly shrunk in length. While they were a great deal - with only wearing them one time .. they have now become too short for him. I followed the instructions for washing also...
1,DONT Bother,"If you're buying this for the hands free headset - DONT Bother. The speaker quality is so poor, I had to push the speaker to my ear with my hand just to hear. I might as well have held my phone. And the phone would still have been louder!"
1,oh midori,"after listening to this cd at a friend's house I have finalized my opinion on Midori being a over-hyped,non-emotional and mechanical violinst; back when she was 13 wearing sailor dresses, she was impressive for her age... unfortunately,since then, neither her palying ability nor her wardrobe have improved."
1,Cracked and buckled,The cabinet arrived from Amazon in a sad condition. The very large package was left on my front door step without a packing slip. The very bottom of the cabinet was cracked close to the right front corner and the front left door was damaged (it buckled). The cabinet is much too large to return so I had to glue together the cracked part and live with the repair and the buckled front door.
1,Don't buy!!,"I thought that we just got a bad batch, but after reading the reviews I can see that that is not the case. We purchased a full set two years ago not based on price but because we loved the design. As others have stated, the first to go were the mugs. I think within 6 months all 8 mugs were gone. It was crazy - the handles would just fall off for no apparent reason. Then the bowls started showing spider cracks and broke apart. So now that the herd has been culled of the weak, we are left with 8 full size dishes, 5 mediums, no mugs and 4 bowls (we had bought two sets). Its really sad because dishes do have sentimental value. My parents had all the various sets of dishes from when they were first married - the old ones just got boxed up and saved for the cabin or large gathering. And eventually us kids when we were in college. Oh well. Hunt begins for a quality set."
1,Ramones It's Alive?,"Wikipedia claims the guitar, voice and bass were actually recorded in the studio, citing an interview with Marky Ramone. If this is true(and there is a conformation from Wiki comparing the DVD to the CD),then it is probably unfair to compare this to other ""live"" albums. This is disappointing as I have just purchased this bogus album. The truth is an elusive and practically unattainable commodity in the world. But I guess I should have known that."
1,could'nt be an chessier than dog,when i saw this film i was a little dispointed for instance they the writers did not give the film enough comic depth & things for actors to do so it was drag for me to watch cute maybe for kids but for single moviegoing adults this may bore you although david arquette gives an amazing proformance despite the awful script he was given better save your money & rent this dog if you dare .
1,Is this the best they could do?,"Jesus, I love the Stooges and I love Iggy. I even listen to some of Iggy's weaker stuff because he does try new things but this album is a real cop-out. Nothing new, just a tired rehash of a sound that's a pale imitation of their first two albums. None of the songs truly rock and Iggy's voice is just plain bad on this. Where's the Down on the Street? Raw Power? Not one of those caliber songs on this album. You can see it on the reviews on this board--everyone's making excuses. I wanted to like it too but they simply didn't deliver. I'm going to see them next month and hope they don't focus on this poor material."
1,shsmeless,"This movie is completely shameless in its distortions, misrepresentations and outright lies. Could only be embraced by conservative christian fundamentalists."
1,Marketing trick,"If you are going to do these exercises , make sure you warm up and warm down otherwise you'll have very stiff muscles . The exercise are not very grounding and you Definately don't get the results like what it says . I had better results doing real yoga DVD exercises . I actually started feeling worse doing these exercises because they leave your chakras very open without grounding exercises , therefore you end up absorbing loads of negative energy from other people . That's my experience with this."
1,"Great receiver, but...","I purchased 2 Onkyo TX-SR805's from Amazon and had to return both of them. The first would shut off every time the I turned the volume about half way up; the second worked great for about 10 days until my wife went to turn it on one day and sparks flew and scared the s... out of her; needless to say, I no longer own an Onkyo. The sound was great, the price was right, the build quality was missing. Both of them also ran hotter than any other electrical device I have short of a space heater. I had a fan on top of the unit to help with cooling and it did lower the temp by about 20 degrees F. I now own a Pioneer Elite, cost more but I am very happy with it and it has worked for 3 weeks now.Amazon's customer service during these problems was 5 stars except for the times I was obviously hooked up overseas and there was a definite language problem; but even so the people I spoke with could not have been nicer - just had to call back during the day to get my issue resolved."
1,Dont waste your time,"If I could give this book 0 stars, I would do it in a heartbeat. And just as the title of this review suggests, please do not waste your time on this book. It is possibly the worst book that has ever been written. William Souder wasted his time writing this book, and my time reading this book.This book is 304 pages of the exact same thing. The only way that this book could be classified as ""Horrifying"" is for the fact that it was actually written and published. I found it in no way enlightening or enjoyable, all this book could be considered as is a major waste of time and money."
1,I really couldn 't get into it ; It didn 't mine attention,I have read a lot of your books you are one of mine favorite author i just had a difficut time reading this; it wasn;t like your other books'
1,Very soft metal,Dont buy these blades as they are cheap quality steel and don't hold up. Save your money and buy a heavy duty heat treated blade from another supplier.
1,Slow read!!,"I had to stop reading this book because it was boring and too slow for me. I like to read books that grab you at the first page and will not let you go til the end. Something you don't want to put down for any reason. Hate to say it but I was thinking of things to do so I would not have to read this book!! I kept trying to read it but finally I gave up and started reading the Resident Evil series which I could not put down now that's better. You want a romance book you don't want to put down try Skye O' malley, Sheik, Eternity by Maggie Shayne, The Last Mermaid by Shana Abe, Bewitching by Jill Barnett, so many others to pass the time by !! Plus the tutors were named Alpha, Gamma, Beta come on!!! Let's get original!"
1,Terribly silly,"Come on, the Chairman of the European Union is the Antechrist? Only an American could have come up with such a silly idea."
1,Don't buy if you want a long lasting lock,"Ok so the first couple weeks the bike lock worked fine. Slowly it was getting harder and harder to unlock. Finally, today I was trying to unlock for at least an hour until it finally came unlocked. That was about the time I threw the thing as far as I could and bought a better lock else where."
1,"Typical 2012 ""comedy"" - unfunny, lame, boring, drug & toilet humor","Not at all fast moving. Too far over the top with the drugs, sex and toilet gags. Who's writing this crap these days. I gave it the full 15 minute opportunity then turned it off and read a marketing book. The book was funnier!----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Rob"
1,Nice try,"Like the othert Delta products I have purchased.. I was excited when my new sander arrived. It assembled well, and looked impressive. Until I snapped the power switch and the motor would not turn. Smoke came out of the motor. I shut the unit down, and double checked everything, again! The motor turned freely by hand, but turn it on. and it would lock. Called support, 30 days later recieved a new motor and installed it. This motor started right up and as I almost got excited, it slowed and stopped. Then did the same thing as the first! I boxed it up, and sent it back. 2 failed motors, over 30 days, and I was still not able to use it! No thank you! Hope this helps!"
1,"Good idea, poor execution","I really like the raised edges of these boards when working with wet ingredients, like cutting tomatoes. However, the thin material of the boards warps/cups, making the board rock on its center on the counter. This combined with the slippery nature of the material itself makes for a very frustrating if not dangerous situation while chopping. The only solution I have found is to put a folded damp kitchen towel under the board to stabilize it. Frankly, that's more trouble than it's worth. For now, I am just using them for holding ingredients after I have prepped them on a better cutting board."
1,Just not good,"Most importantly, the iron doesn't get that hot. I want to see smoke after a minute because that's what 400F should do! The stand gets way too hot because it rests on the iron. The on off switch is poorly located so you inadvertently end up turning off the iron or lowering the heat setting while trying to load your hair. Whack!"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. BUYER BEWARE,"I bought this product, in the hopes of stopping my player getting more scratched than it is now. there are no good points too this product. The cover does not fit the player properly. The cover covers the earplug hole partly restricting usage of this port. The hinges of the plastic screen protector won't fit into the holes as the case won't stretch far enough.I tried to turn on my player while the case was on it, but the player wouldn't turn on due too all the buttons being pressed down at the same time, by the tightness of the case.If I could give this negative rating or even a zero I would do this without hesitation."
1,A Complete Mishmosh,"In 1985 Bob Geldoff got a bunch of really good artists and a bunch of really bad artists together for a concert to help Africas starving, a good cause but the concert has too many bad performances from the always bad recording artists like Phil Collins, Alison Moyet, Wham, Sade and Ultravox and not enough good performances from the always good ones like Sting, Queen, The Who and David Bowie. The result is that this (too pop) music concert is not worth owning unlike better concerts of multiple artists like Festival Express, Rock And Roll Circus and The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert. Its too much like Dead Aid then Live Aid."
1,Liars Poker: There are 23496 characters in this book?,"Knowing the reputation Michael Lewis has, I had high hopes about his first book and how enlighting it could be. However, after hitting the midway point all I wanted was for it to end (never leave a book unfinished).Honestly, I struggle to find what all the hub bub was about with this book. His writing style is very drab and he introduces way to many characters in the book to the point you begin to just gloss over names as you realize no one matters, as there is no point to any of his stories.I cant describe other feelings as this book has left no impression on me what so ever and a better read if your looking for a bit of history and insight upon the inner workings of Wall Street tycoons is ""When Genuis Failed: The Rise and Fall of Long Term Capital Management"" by Roger Lowenstein."
1,Did Not Receive What Is In The Picture,"The slip pictured here is a full slip, mid calf The slip I received is just a bit longer than a camiWhat happenedWhat is in this picture is not what I received"
1,I Just Didn't Find This Film Interesting,"Perhaps I am a sad product of the modern, Hollywood, special-effects horror movie. I watched this movie with an open mind, hoping to be chilled and intrigued. Instead, I found the movie long and tedious. The acting was, in my opinion, overdone (think about how Shirley Temple overacted her roles in the old black and white movies). The plot was interesting but predictable. The set was beautiful, the soundtrack was great... other than that, there wasn't much to keep me interested. This movie is, however, better than the ridiculous, color remake. For a good B&W haunted house movie, watch ""House on Haunted Hill"" with Vincent Price."
1,Gross dont buy!!,These taste gross and I would not eat them. They are going in the trash!!! Dont waste your money. You are better off just eating something else. I was very disappointed that the reviews said they were tasty because they are anything but. My dog wont even eat them.
1,From prejudice on prejudice,This book is written from the point of view of a fundamentalist Christian who believes that Abraham's eldest son Ishmael was jealous of his younger brother Isaac. This is seen as sinful because it was God's will that Isaac should be the heir. So to this day the descendants of Ishmael hate the descendants of Isaac. Really there is nothing new in this book. And it says the bombing of London in World War Two was Britain's punishment for betraying the Jews. This is a little illogical because the Jewish people suffered more than any other nation in that war. Not a nice book.
1,The worst book I have ever read!,"This is such a big disappointment after all of her other books. I usually can't wait to read a new Sandra Brown book, but this time I could hardly finish it because it was so boring. Sandra Brown can do better than this."
1,PRETTY BAD,HORRIBLE CGI AND AWFUL SCRIPT AND ACTING COMBINE TO MAKE THIS A REAL HOWLER. MARC SINGER USES A WICKED SNARL AND SPOUTS RIDICULOUS PLATITUDES AND HAS ONE OF THE WORST DEATH SCENES EVER. VILLAIN BRIAN THOMPSON HIDES WISELY BEHIND A HOODED ROBE AND LOOKS EMBARRASSED. THE DRAGON EFFECTS AND THE BATTLE SCENES ARE ATROCIOUS. AVOID.
1,Okay for grownups - not great for kids,"I read this book to my five-year-old. I was expecting a wonderful adventure story and was disappointed - so was he. It started out fine - with descriptions of Stuart's family situation and the struggles he had with being ""like a mouse."" But the story quickly went south as Stuart went north to look for his bird friend. He simply leaves his family and doesn't seem to miss them because he is so obsessed with this bird. Some of the situations were funny to me as an adult but were totally lost on my child. Therefore, I think this would be a good book for adults but not a good story for kids. We rented the movie this weekend and it was much better than the book (I don't think I've ever thought that before!)"
1,Boring!!!,I wish I had seen some of these reviews before purchasing this DVD I could have saved myself some time and money. This has got to be without a doubt the biggest load of rubbish I have ever had the displeasure of watching.The acting was amateurish the storyline was uninspiring all in all this rates as one of the worst movies ever. I wish I could give this film zero stars but unfortunately this is not an option so I am stuck giving it 1 star which is way too generous.There is not much else to say except don't bother with this film it's not worth the effort.
1,sharp but...,"The nail cutter is sharper than other kinds I bought before & it's cuter too. However, I might be unlucky as right on the first use, the cutter was broken! I returned it & got full refund from Amazon. I'm happy though!"
1,Kangaroo Court more like it!,"""The Hague"" was created as a means to justify the US/UK's bombing of the Serbian population - they bombed them in Croatia, Bosnia and Serbia. The court is anti-Serbian and is seen as a Kangaroo Court, not an international court of justice! If it were after justice it would also deal with the issue of the illegal bombing of Serbia by the US/UK - no not interested in that. Therefore don't be interested in this book as the title and contents is hypocritical!"
1,Poor fit,"Bought these in medium, which is my glove size for all gloves ever used, but these were way too small. I gave them to my wife and bought a pair in large. Still awfully tight but I can get them on. Only problem now is that the fingertips are a quarter inch too long. Not impressed. Buy at your own risk."
1,It was really BAD!,"I love the products Logitech make, but this was a terrible one. When I first bought it, it lasted less than a month. Also, it can easily fall off, it doesn't feel comfortable, and it hurts my ear after a while. SO I highly recommend NOT to buy this product, but another one from Logitech."
1,Not for cystic acne,"You hear a lot of mixed reviews regarding zeno, and personally, it did was not effective for my skin condition. The product's insert DOES disclaim that it is not effective for severe acne in the form of cystic acne so I can't exactly be surprised by the outcome. Still, since a lot of ppl claim that it worked for them, I tried it for a month. I used the device right whenever I felt a zit forming, but to my disappointment I'd still get the breakout."
1,Just a friendly word of warning:,"L & H filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in December 2000.Their products are usually good, and their people do their best to support them. The algorithms are sound."
1,GO BACK TO iTUNES...,"brilliant show and my favorite on tv, season 4 is terrific as well. BUT, NBC needs to go back to iTunes; its had to have lost money; wanting to charge so much for an episode 4.99? its not fair when NBC leaves iTunes for this idiotic service. its not even compatible with mac, or I would purchase it. instead, i may do like many others and illegally download it. thanks but no thanks."
1,"Don't let the rating fool you. I love this show, but...",I absolutely love this show and so do my two five year olds and eight year old. The problem is that this is only five of the shows and some extras and there are a LOT more that have been shown-probably around 23...I know because they are all on my DVR. The one star is for this not being a Season 1 Box set. I don't want Disney to suck me in to this small selection and not put out (or worse put out once I buy this) a full season box set. Come on Disney. Don't rip off your fans of this show...put out the whole box set. This show rocks! And that's from a 47 year old!
1,"Disappointing, except for one song","George Harrison absolutely LOVED ukulele/Hawaiian music in the last years of his life. It is a shame that he didn't do an entire album of covers as he has the exuberant, buoyant spirit of that genre down perfectly in his cover here of ""Devil and the deep blue sea"". It is the one irresistably charming element in an otherwise hum-drum set. Most of this album is uninspired and lacks melodic hooks to draw you in. Songs begin, progress, and then end with hardly anything musically noteworthy occurring. Some seem as if they were slapped together quickly and beg for reworking. Yes, I know that George was very ill when he made this. An album should not be given high ratings merely because it is a memento of a dying legend, though."
1,THE CAT DIED,"I PICKED THIS C D UP IN THE USED BIN....I PUT IT ON AND MY CAT HOWLED AT THE SOUND OF THE VOICE AND KEELED OVER DEAD!!!! ""ENOUGH WRITTEN""-I BURIED THE C D WITH THE CAT....."
1,Surprised by negative tone throughout...,"Everyone told me to get this book. Once I did, I was very dissapointed by its negative tone. Could have used some more humor, less bitterness."
1,No chemistry between Wright-Penn or Costner,"The two stars had about as much chemistry as flat Coke and water.If you want to see a love story that positively smolders, don't watch this one. I found myself wishing it would get over. The only saving grace was Paul Newman. Read the book. Let's hope Nicholas Sparks' book THE NOTEBOOK gets more credibility than this one..The bottom line here is: HO HUM"
1,Absent seller - total rip-off,"I ordered the product, then never heard from the seller. No shipment, no response to e-mail ... BUT, the charge showed up on my credit card. I managed to get a credit, but Amazon told me there was nothing I could do to cancel the sale until after the last possible shipment date, which was a month out. So, I had to wait a month before I could order it from someone else, just in case the seller decided to honor their agreement. Bad experience all around. I wouldn't order anything else from this seller."
1,Seattles Loch Mess,"Corny acting. Silly plot deviations showing the human side of the monster search (your wives yell at you a lot.)Production suffers when you can't hear what is being said one second, then it's too loud. Overbearingly loud music.Not even worthy of the title mockumentary. The Indian connection was pretty much contrived, and themonster itself a standard Plesiosaur that travels to and fro the ocean via secret tunnels. Check out ""Incident at Loch Ness"" if youwant to be entertained by a Lake Monster. That movie is hilarious. This is garbage."
1,clothesed-minded,"Out of curiosity I wanted to see what was available for our youth.I was compelled to say how dissapointed I am at the segregated racist world we live in.Each cover shows a white, blond girl. They're pretty and covered in make-up. What is it this magazine is trying to convey?The United States is a multi-cultural country of beautiful girls from various ethnicities.Let us foster that beautiful unity in diversity & continue to inculcate this into our girls that beauty on the inside certainly makes one even more beautiful on the outside."
1,A total waste of money,"I have not been able to measure the temperature with this device. I tried it on myself, my spouse, and my baby. Each time the temperature reading was different and completely off from a normal temperature when all three of us were healthy. I can't imagine using it when the baby is actually sick."
1,It wasn't what I ordered,It has only the red laser but no blue beam. The reason this thing is named 2 in 1 was because of an additional Heart Shape Hanger Light (it blinks in shades when it detects vibration) for your pets.
1,Poor recorder and player.,"This thing was a hundred dollars' worth of a headache. DVD-R formatting was always an issue, with the crash at 98% completion that others experienced. Recording wasn't reliable. I ended up using it just as a DVD player, but even that degraded over time. Now it'll play maybe about half the discs I try.Junk, utter junk. And zero recourse: Cyberhome went out of business last year."
1,Instant Garden Trash,"I guess that it's no worse and probably a little better than a garden gnome. Sadly, it won't scare away birds any better than a garden gnome, either. While I haven't seen a bird sit on it, they have walked over to it to inspect it. I have tried multiple locations and the only way it will scare birds is if you throw it at them.Which may be it's best use."
1,Trance:Curse of the Gods,Please save yourselves from buying this CD or any related material. Easily mixed by DJ's with no imagination to fill the void for eleventeen year old noodles on too much mdma. Please do the world a favor and un-hype overpaid club dj's that play nothing but anthem after mind wrenching anthem.
1,Worthless,"No need for details, this movie is total garbage. Lousy plot line if any. Unattractive actors. Terrible film to DVD transfer.Spotty audio. A total waste of time and money"
1,Adobe FrameMaker 7.0,"The book that I received has a property mark: DENVER PUBLIC LIBRARY.I want to know if is legal to sell this book, I don't want to have a problem in the future."
1,Very old book,"This book is a 'xerox' copy of the version that was published in 1920. The copy looks grainy.I never find words that I am looking for in the book because biology uses many modern technical terms. Perhaps it is valuable historically, but make sure that you understand that this is the purpose of the current publisher."
1,"works, properly","works, is exactly as advertised, but it's just way too expensive, found one at a LFS 2 days after receiving for 4 bucks."
1,If you want to be ripped off buy this,This product is garbage. I've used disc resurfacers that cost less and worked much better. The memorex Opti-fix is worthless. It doesnt even touch the smallest of scratches. poor product... very very poor. DO NOT BUY ONE OF THESE!!!
1,Easy Jack,A good product but didn't serve the purpose I bought it for. I was disappointed because I was getting an annoying static hissing sound in the background when I used the telephone. I had to return it for refund.
1,Not very good,First off the broadcasters did not know that they were talking about. there was no john mccarthy as ref the royce gracie shamrock match was very boring. ufc 1 was not as good as i thought it would be
1,Way to LOUD!,"I tried this toy at it's lowest volume, and it's still lound enough to damage young eardrums. Remember that this toy is much closer to their ears than yours."
1,does not play!,The dvd is bogus...won't play...I'd like to send it back to the garage it was made in.
1,Digital Thermometer,I ordered 2 of these thermometers with remote sensors. I put the 2 remotesensors together outside. alsong with a mecury thermometer. The 2 sensors were 6.3 degrees different from one another and neither one matched the mecury thermometer. The inside temperature was 2.5 degrees off from one unit to anotherVery dissapointed.
1,Item NOT as described!!! Very upsetting..,It was NOT stated that this movie was a different region- it did not work in my US DVD player - the movie was only viewable for UK and Ireland- NOWHERE was this stated on the post on Amazon.
1,Defective and Small,"The one I received was defective - it is always hot as long as it's plugged in, which makes the on/off switch and the programming completely useless. I should also note that the ""4 cups"" it makes are pretty small - for me, it's about 2 mugs of coffee. My last 4-cup coffee maker made more."
1,Not for me,I started this and could not get interested. But it may be fine for others. I will try to get into it again.
1,Almost a great light.,"This light seems perfect in everyway, the amount of light, LED, adapter, fits book well, but after 6 months the lights started flickering and going out. It is useless now. I see another buyer had a defective light. It could be problematic of this model."
1,"Too quick, too short","I found that by the time I was in the pose being taught, Mr. Yee was already moving on to the next pose. I usually find yoga relaxing, but this video made me feel rushed and out of sync. Also, the routine was over very quickly, and seemed shorter than 30 minutes. In my opinion, this video was a waste of time and money."
1,Not exactly what i thought it would be,"OK, admittedly, I didn't take a lot of time to review before I purchased. I speak a little Spanish and was in Panama with extremely limited access to internet. I decided I should download a quick phrase book, but after trying to find something new in it for about half hour, I put it aside. I doubt I'll ever open it again."
1,Too small,"The machine is too small and I'm unsure if the ""no bag"" feature is good. You can hardly judge it size by picture and it becomes a problem when you get it."
1,Boring,"I don't see what's a big deal. This is first D. Steel's book I've read and it was average and shallow. I think this is the first and last of Mrs Steel books I'll read. Trust me, don't buy it!"
1,Lets kill the Original with a resounding NOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!,They did not learn from the big mistake in Revenge of the Sith with how Darth Vader ruined the movie with his NOOOOOOOOOO!!!! Now they put it in Return of the Jedi as Vader picks up the Emperor and tosses him down the reactor core. Yea I will stick to my Original VHS that I bought back in the 80's. Sorry George your time is now past. Step down as CEO and let someone with a sense of stability and leave the movies alone.
1,It Rusts,"I figured out how to stack more dishes by angling the glasses, and I love the drainer, BUT it rusts! Stainless steel, my foot!"
1,Broke on my first try,"The geared center column broke the first time I took it out and gave it a test set-up. For warranty service they want a receipt (which I don't have because it was a gift), then they want you to send it to them on your own dime as well as paying $7.50 for them to ship it back to you. So I'd be paying a third the cost of the tripod to get a repaired/refurbished unit back and hope that one lasts. With a 1:1 failure rate that doesn't seem like a good bet.Seemed slick at first (for all of five minutes) but the plastic parts feel flimsy, and given my experience I expect they are.The carry handle is cute, but if you go to the next tier in tripod price/quality they generally throw in a carry bag which you can sling over your shoulder. That would be much handier if you want to carry the tripod any significant distance, or take freehand shots with your camera along the way."
1,what is this?,"I'm an old meshuggah fan, I love all their works and I only was a bit disappointed with _nothing_. But after listening to catch33 Nothing seems like a masterpiece.. Catch 33 is even worse, I don't like it. I hope they change their sound in the next release."
1,Absolutely Terrible!!,"I bought the entire set (corner, table and bench) and had nonstop problems with the whole thing. First was the bench. It had a big crack down the middle, not enough to split it, just enough to look terrible. Next I attempted to put the table together. The wood on one of the legs was split down the middle making it unusable. I was directed to the manufacturer, and I could not speak to anyone directly, I was only able leave a message. After 6 tries, I actually spoke to someone who was rude and reluctant to replace the piece. When I finally got the new piece, it was the wrong one. I wanted a refund but was persuaded to try a replacement table. I then opened the corner unit and discovered it was filled with nicks, chips and cracks. This time I wanted my money back! The time I wasted was very frustrating. I strongly recommend not buying this piece of garbage."
1,Shaved off nothing but my skin.,"I've tried everything on this razor. I bought a water sharpening stone to hone it, and I have a strop. However, no matter how much I sharpen it or hone it, it remains dull. I go over my face over and over again, and very little hair is removed. I do manage to cut my self 22 times, but little hair is removed. If you want to shave with a straight razor you should either buy a DOVO or buy a vintage one from the 30's made by a good american company such as:1.) Waterville2.) Genco3.) Geneva4.) Case (W.R. Case & Sons)5.) Winchester6.) Sta-Sharp7.) Craftsman (There is also a German version that is superlative)You can find these razors in fine shape on ebay for under $20"
1,Waste of time!,"Reader from Oklahoma, we know you are Matthew Lesko! You make so many references to yourself. Shame on you for writing your own review! If you are upset about your book getting bad reviews then trying writing a book with substance!"
1,I have nothing to Say because this Book has nothing to Tell,this is the worst book i've ever read. wasted my money and time. the author has no ORIGINAL thoughts and stole all the ideas and comments. TERRIBLE BOOK.
1,Better heard than read.,"I bought Angela's Ashes after hearing Frank McCourt read from it on the radio. Over the radio, it was like the bedtime story you hoped would never end. This is because McCourt is the consummate Irish story teller.Unfortunately, in print, the same story is bleak and largely devoid of the magic Frank McCourt brings to it in the telling. So, if you haven't read Angela's Ashes yet, see if it is available on tape. If so, buy it and save yourself the unpleasantness of encountering this trying story without Frank McCourt as your personal guide. It's like the difference between canned asparagus and fresh."
1,"Doesn't have ""Kiss From A Rose music video""","I love Seal, so why no music video. There's everything else. I'm very dissapointed. other extras are ok I guess."
1,Sadly Sung,"Had a hard time getting thru even one listening. The ""gala"" should have been called an old folks outing. Only John Barrowman was young enough to still be singing, and his performance is sadly lackluster. The rest of the voices are well past sell-by date."
1,Shakespears's An Age of Kings,"I was delighted that this was now available on DVD. Alas, I was bitterly disappointed by the product. The discs start and stop or stop altogether. Two messages to Amazon have failed to elicit a reply. I am thoroughly disgusted and would obviously warn against buying it."
1,Really?,"Ok, I have all the respect in the world for Shawn Michaels, but do we really need another DVD on his career? Where is Christian's DVD? That is one I would love to see! Sure he hasn't been in the business as long as Shawn, but if Morrison and Hardy get their own DVDs, I think Christian is LOOOONG overdue. Not to mention Lita for that matter. I think lately these WWE DVDs have really dropped the ball. I loved some of the earlier ones with a documentary on the stars career as well as the matches. BIG disappointment that neither the Edge or Randy Savage DVDs included documentaries on their careers."
1,Coby 224 DVD Player,"We purchased the Coby 224 DVD Player from Amazon and have found it to be unsatisfactory. It refuses to play many DVD's. We have owned it for 60 days and at first, we thought it was bad DVD's from the rental store. We now believe it the Player that is the source of the problem. Unfortunately, we confirmed this too late and Amazon now refuses to allow a return."
1,SUFFOCATION RISK,"I BOUGHT THIS ITEM B/C BABIES DO LOVE THE TAGS ON THINGS BUT THIS EVENING MY 4 MONTH OLD ALMOST SUFFOCATED BECAUSE OF IT! I LOOKED OVER TO HER SITTING ON THE HER BOUNCY SEAT TO FIND THE 12 X 12 BLANKET COMPLETELY OVER HER FACE AND HEARD HER GASPING FOR AIR! I RUSHED OVER TO HER AND THANK GOD SHE WAS AND IS OK! I JUST WENT ON THE TAGGIES WEBSITE TO FIND THE BLANKET IS RECOMMENDED FOR ALL AGES AND IS APPROVED BY JMPA, TIA AND ICPHSO. I AM SURE MY BABY IS NOT THE FIRST TO HAVE THIS HAPPEN AND I WOULD THINK TWICE ABOUT BUYING THIS ITEM FOR A BABY DESPITE IT BEING RECOMMENDED FOR ALL AGES. THIS ALSO GOES TO SHOW THAT EVEN THOUGH AN ITEM IS APPROVED BY VARIOUS SAFETY ORGANIZATIONS, THAT MAY NOT MEAN THE ITEM IS IN FACT SAFE."
1,A complete waste of time!,Don't waste your money on this video tape. The TV director had no concept of directing this type of a program. He thought it was more important to show a closeup of Erroll sweating than how he was creating his style on the keyboard. I watched this video once and that was enough.
1,worked great...for a day,"I purchased this based on the recommendation from Amazon about what a great add-on this product is. It was great - the one time it worked. Unfortunately, I needed to leave the country (on vacation) so I didn't get a chance to return it the time limit. I'm glad it was less than $10 but I guess I got what I paid for. Maybe I got a reject from the factory because the other customer reviews were good."
1,Why did I bother?,"I have never had much luck with Huggies in the past, but I thought I'd give them a try again, since I could save a bit on the Subscribe shipments.I have two little ones in diapers, a six month old (16lb) and a two and half year old (27lb). Both of my boys leak through these thin diapers in about 6 hours. Which means almost every night.I have had better luck with generic store brand diapers than these. The strength of the velcro tabs is pretty weak on these diapers too.Always try a small pack of diapers before you go buy a big box or two. I learned that lesson again."
1,"Wonderful book, but where are my cards?","The book is very easy to follow and informative. However, it did not come with cards as described. I had to go out and buy a separate deck."
1,Mostly great but felt cheated with the ending,"I liked this book. I liked the hard scifi, military action and creative alien enemies. Author had me engrossed through most of the book with a very creative plot and colorful narration. First chapter had me hooked and I invested in the book and enjoyed the read until the end. There isnt and ending really and no payoff for the reading investment. It strikes the me author had to make a deadline and wrote a 5 page ending to wrap up the prior 300 pages. I was so invested and wanted to know where things were going I felt cheated and angry after reading the conclusion and can only give it 2 stars. Investment in a couple of chapters to provide a comprehensive and satisfying conclusion would have made this a 5 star book."
1,"Great Product but not ""Plasma Proof""","This is the best IR receiver I've tried;it's ""plasma resistant"" but a long way from ""plasma proof"". The design is good and the unit is useful (used daily).However the feeedback LED flashes constantly with our NEC 42mp3 even when placed 8-12"" above and 12"" behind the screen. We've tried using ferrites on the cord and filters at the IR repeater but without any noticable improvement.The remote commands seem to get through about 80% of the time but the constant flashing is annoying.If you want an excellent value in an IR recevier buy this one just don't expect it to work miracles with a plasma screen."
1,DO NOT BUY,This product produced a U61 error barely a year after we purchased it therefore the 1 year warranty was up and Panasonic was going to charge us $140 to service a machine that we originally bought new for less than that price. Throughout the year for every 2 DVDs we were able to burn successfully there was one that did not work properly. I'll never buy another panasonic!!
1,bad quality,"I am very dissatisfied with the paint quality of the product. It looks like the paint did not dry out before the pieces were put together so once separated the paint simply peeled off. For the price, one could expect a better quality."
1,"Misleading, sloppy, incomplete manual","If I did not already understand wireless networking and security, I never would have been able to get it working. Yes, it works fine, but I cannot recommend the unit. How expensive or how difficult can it be to write a concise and accurate manual? I came close to returning the unit, but found nothing better."
1,Very Overrated,The music is good but I've heard lounge singers and next door neighbors that have better voices. I love this genre of music and thought I would give him a try. Never again. This was a joke. You can't even compare him to the rich vocals of Michael Buble. Matt Dusk isn't in the same league. Save your money!
1,Can't get past the odor,"I purchased this to use on my face for pre cancerous lesions ( per a guest on Dr Oz). I applied it to my face, but could not stand the smell so I rinsed it off. It did leave my skin much softer and might have been okay for another area of the body."
1,Phrasebook?,"This is much more a dictionary than a phrasebook. I found it quite useless for my purposes. I subsequently bought a Barron's phrasebook, which was much more useful."
1,"Terrible radio, Terrible Service","I bought this after christmas because I did not recive one and was so excited. I have always wanted a radio in my kitchen, one that did not take up too much space. After the two hour installation I plugged the unit in expecting it to work and low and behold, the CD player would not open. I read that there were similar problems with this happining from the other reviews but bought this product anyway. (stupidity on my part) I called sony and they only pay for shipping out a new replacment not for you to send it to them, even though this is a brand new product and I am a brand new customer. Sony sucks and this crappy radio sucks. I hope sony reads these reviews and will start to make better products. I will never buy anything from sony again!!! Oh, the only reason for a 1 star is because there are no 0's"
1,Never got it!,"I ordered 2 items, they were shipped about a week apart and I only got 1 item. This order was placed back in October."
1,Good idea...boring presentation,I was really excited about reading this book but it was SO BORING!! I never finished it because it ended up so predictable and there was no excitement!
1,What A Waste Of Money,I do not rate this book very highly. I think that Dr David Holden totaly wrong about his views and should go back to school
1,Excellent Concert - Poor quality CD,"I had this concert on cassette tape years ago and wanted to buy the CD. As mentioned by others, the music and on-stage entertainment from this ""album"" is top-notch. However, the CD I received sounded like a boot-leg recording of a scratched LP."
1,Doesn't live up to the NPR hype,"I heard about this album on NPR, and from the blurbs they played on air, it seemed like something I might like. But when I played the album, all the songs sounded pretty much the same, and nothing cought my ear as I had hoped it would. I may give it a few more listens, and who knows, maybe it will grow on me."
1,DOES NOT WORK,I don't suggest you buy this. Our house has at least 50 fruit flies swarming in the kitchen (with no exaggeration) and this has only caught 3 and probably out of pure bad luck for the fly. (It has been on the outlet for three days). Definitely not worth the money; don't buy it!
1,Terfel's voice and manner not well suited to this repertoire,"I expected more satisfaction, delight from this CD than I received. Terfel is undoubtedly a major operatic talent, but his voice and style are too violent, brusque, lacking in variety for many of these selections. He alternates between a crude shout and a pianissimo. The lyrical, liquid mezzo voce that, say, Fischer-Dieskau commands is missing. To my ears he seems out of his element here."
1,The Roadgear Hi-Tec Digital Tire Gauge isn't,"I thought this new Roadgear talking tire gauge would be a good replacement for the Roadgear all black digital gauge I've carried on all my bikes since 1996 or so,(I bought it from Roadgear at a rally in Oregon). It Isn't. The voice feature is nice and it works but the gauge is both inaccurate and hard to use. When I checked the pressure in a tire it was 45psi on 3 different gauges, this gauge read 43psi. It is always 2psi low. Sealing the tip on my 90 degree valve stems is almost impossible. The head of the tire gauge needs to be angled for the new 90 degree valve stems, more like a car tire gauge. Overall, it 'sorta' works but I expected more.The return process with Amazon is truly amazing. Easy, fast and efficient. I have never before returned anything to Amazon and this experience reinforces my shopping here."
1,Old Music Book,"Condition of book was not very good, but music is still able to be read. Nice easy Xmas music for young learners."
1,Poor quality control,"I've been a Riedel user for many years, including a set of the Sommelier series. These Ouverture Magnums have been our everyday wine glasses, and when some break I order more. The most recent set was very disappointing, with visible striations on the rim edges from substandard ""polishing"" on all four glasses, and you can feel the roughness when you run your fingernail along it. So think twice or three times before you buy, and recognize that you get what you pay for."
1,Too small,This product probably works fine at larger levels but at the small the bottle neck is too narrow to allow anything but crumbs to come through. With this sized rope and the storage available in the bottle the product would work perfectly if it had a larger opening to allow dog to pull out treats. Sadly this is not the case.I'm hesitant to purchase a larger one as I worry the bottle neck-rope width issue will be just as present as it is in the small.
1,Cheep,"On amazon, I consistently find great deals that blow other prices out of the water. Occasionally you find a deal that's too good to be true - thats the case with these cables... not worth the $ saved - they're cheaply made - you have to jam them into the receptacles - They fit so snug I wonder if i'm ever going to get them out... or sound guy gently encouraged ""lets not buy these again..."""
1,Poor Abridgement?,"I heard the audio book version. It was a poor job of condensation. I cannot tell whether I'd like the underlying book, but the audio version fails to link the events, skips through things that are apparently important to the story line, and glosses over much of the character definition. The features of the book that are lauded in the reviews are not present in the audio version."
1,Inside cover and opening easy to trap dirt,I bought this set of two at local Houston Costco. The two get dirty and muddy inside the cover and the opening. I can't clean it and it smells badly.I emailed Contigo customer care and their reply is give me some regular cleaning instruction and how to keep it clean this and that. I'll never buy this product again.
1,Outdated Software & non-existent tech support,"I bought this book in preparation for the GRE. I bought it online, so I based my decision on the claims made by Research & Education Association. They claim to be ""The Very Best Coaching & Studying Course"". The other reason why I chose this book was because it offered 6 Full-Length Practice Exams. I got the book and I wasn't too impressed with the set up or the explanations, but I thought it would be redeemed with the tests. I tried for hours to get the CD to load correctly. It was written for ancient machines and the patches provided for Windows Vistas do NOT work. I have tried for 2 weeks to get someone in their tech dept. to help me resolve the issues, but I have not heard back. I also wrote to the main office to express my disenchantment, and they also didn't respond. It is the worse $40.00 (I didn't buy it on Amazon) I have spent on a book!!! The only reason why I give it two stars is because it does a respectable job with some written exercises."
1,Cost is TOO MUCH for a DVD!!!,"This is a great movie, I remember watching it when I was younger and wanted to buy it for my daughter. I don't understand why this DVD cost what it does. I have bought movies that are better and more popular for much less. Even Wizard of Oz, which is a classic, is under $20. I will never pay this much for a single DVD... this is CRAZY pricing. Brian Bloom is super sexy in this movie but still not sexy enough to make me want to pay more than $25 for a DVD. $25 is even too high but doable."
1,Somewhere over the Rainbow,"Is sung by Israel Kamakawiwo`ole, now deceased. But Amazon does carry his CD's.And yes I was disappointed that it was not included on the soundtrack. I hate it when they do that."
1,another crappy nu metal band,Let me just say this i hate nu metal its crap its uninspired its just a way to cash in on all the other pointless music todaythe songs on here dont have guitar solos they have stupid lyrics and the members of the band look like wierdosMy cousin likes these retards for some odd reason I wish these guys and the rest of these nu metal bands would stop putting out these crappy albums now cause its getting oldso in coclusion i give this group and this album 0 stars for lack of origanality and pointand i hope someone will come along and shut these nu metal morons up and put them in there place
1,Sensitive/Inaccurate step count,"I bought three of these for Christmas, and we are all having a difficult time getting them to work correctly. There is a button on the back of the item that allows you to control the sensitivity if the machine is counting too little or too many steps. If you push it too far to the left, it doesn't count enough, and if you push it too far to the right, then it counts a ton of steps. Unfortunately, becuase it is so sensitive and often quite inaccurate, we aren't using them like I hoped we would. Also, the button to ""clear"" the amount of steps is too easy to accidentally knock and clear the data for the day/workout. I wouldn't recommend this product."
1,Doesn't fly well,"The kite goes up very easily but unfortunately comes down very easily even in a strong wind. For no apparent reason, this kite simply drifts downward to the left or right and often doesn't stop until it hits the ground. Id' say it's pretty useless. UPDATE: The flew very straight and high yesterday in a 7 MPH wind. Unfortunately, the kite handle was dropped and the kite continued flying upwards and straight until the handle snagged at the top of a tree. The kite continued to fly well, but we had to leave and the kite was lost. So it's not clear to me that the kite has a problem after all. I won't buy another though -- too many single string kites lost in trees."
1,brdhouse not as ez as adertised,"Product was not fabricated well. but well designed. the holes for the string were much too small. they could have used a bigger diamteter drill. also, i had to redrill some holes as some of them were not drill all the way thru.the delivery was not prompt and they didn't charge me for the spider that was enclosed in the box yuck. i had to look up manufacturer to let them know that some screws were missing. they said they would ship out replacements. still waiting. i wouldn't buy from this manufacturer again."
1,Really bad,I bought the 3d Blu ray version of this movie....it was SO boring...I forced myself to make it past the first 20 minutes....I never got what the story was about....nothing interesting ever happens...the two krills are stupid to say the least....the music was annoying....the 3D was the worst I've seen...so much ghosting it made me dizzy....I couldn't wait for it to end....I will use the disc as a coaster for drinks....don't buy this...caca.
1,"Would have been good, maybe...","I one I received was not drilled through the center of the pin. This caused a wobble effect on one of the handles. I think being from a seller other than Amazon but shipped through Amazon, I could not do an exchange, only return. I also took a good look at the parts. The rod doesn't appear to be stainless so eventually it will corrode. There are nylon bushings on each side. If anyone is interested, I would suggest the rod be replaced with stainless, aluminum or maybe even carbon fiber. The diameter of the rod is approximately 0.250"", measured with calipers. This would increase the cost of the pin but the result is no rust, flaking from the rod, etc. Of course, I still recommend hand wash only.I wish a company would care to produce a centered drilled marble pin with nylon bushing and non-corroding rod.update: After ordering several other ""brands"", I think the marble all come from the same place in Taiwan and the QC is just not there."
1,False alarms,"Less than a year ago, I replaced all the smoke detectors in my home with the Kidde i12060. They go off for no reason- we dont smoke, and cooking doesnt set them off. They just go bad. I checked the batteries- they are still good. I am so tired of the false alarms that I am going to replace them all with a different brand. I see that these have good ratings from others, but I just wanted to share my bad experiance so that you are forewarned."
1,horrible headphones,worst pair of headphones i ever bought. dont listen to the other commentes because its terrible. the bass is off tune. im not lying i got these today and they suck. im dissapointed in skullcandy. the bass isnt even that good and you can barely hear the music. im getting rid of these and getting sony headphones
1,"Too small for 60"" table","I ordered this for my 60"" diameter patio table. Assumed 61""x61""x2"" would cover it easily. However, the cover is 61"" in diameter when fully stretched. No way it will cover a 60"" diameter table.The plastic is actually pretty heavy duty, sort of plasticized fabric. Could be a decent cover for a 54"" diameter table (or smaller). I returned it and got full credit."
1,Don't buy these!,"I registered for these because Henckels has a good reputation, but i am really disappointed. The knives are not recommended for the dishwasher and I have hand washed them all. Despite this after one time of using the chopping knife and hand washing it, it has begun to rust. I wish I would have registered for the more expensive knives. In the long run it would have saved me money!"
1,"Horrible movie, great soundtrack","As a child of the 80s, I have heard how awesome ""Valley Girl"" is. I had never seen it so I bought it thinking that it would probably go into my permanent 80s DVD collection. Well, it was a HORRIBLE movie. Poorly written, poorly acted, and it seems to drag on forever. Half way through I was wondering when the plot was going to begin. The shining ""star"" is Nicholas Cage who could not act and still can't. He should have won a razzie for this performance. Rippin' soundtrack though. Very reflective of the early 80s musical climate."
1,Great - if you own stock in superglue!!,"I too did not read the reviews before I bought it, and we can't even get it put together, much less get it to STAY together!! I'm seriously close to breaking out the soldering iron!! My son loves the trains and the tracks, but they barely stay together on the floor, much less suspended by flimsy plastic. Great toy for hardwood floors, very careful kids, and a lot of superglue. Other than that...you might wanna skip this one and get some of the other Thomas train sets that are a little more durable."
1,Been there done that,"Eh..I've read and watched other mangas/animes that have better storylines. This story is not that original, and the fact that the main character has no backbone gets kind of old and annoying. I also couldn't stand the artwork. The characters are not cute at all. It seemed like the author tried to change her drawing style around volume 4 or 5, to try and give the characters more emotion/depth (with the humorous expressions with buggy eyes, dropping jaws, etc.) but it didn't work for me. If you want a better story with blackmail and with better artwork, I highly suggest Peach Girl."
1,Quiet and perfectly made but...,"I have read reviews elsewhere on this album and they praise the emotion and delivery. But for me every word seems drawn out and laboured and after a while I get bored. Be warned, I always prefer my Jazz uptempo - so its probably just my bias talking.The liner notes say ""Jimmy Scott"" vocals (a man) but the cover is a woman (surely?) and the vocals certainly sound very feminine. Whats the story? Who is singing?To conclude - if you find Norah Jones a bit noisy and want something to smooth along in the background (while you mix martinis) then this may be a 4 out 5 album.But for me its just too dull - so only gets 2 out 5."
1,"re-cased, same shows","While this DVD has a new name, all but one of the 6 episodes are reruns, seen in the other Kipper DVDs and VHS. While this DVD is 109 minutes long, over 60 minutes of that are clips from other HIT shows, or trailers. ""The little Ghost"" is the only ""new"" Kipper episode there. Unfortunately, this website does not show that this DVD is full of reruns, so there is no way to know if you are buying something new. The same problem exists with the Kipper show ""Water Play"", it has all used episodes except for one."
1,slow,The real Bernie may have been very interesting but the movie about his life wasn't. There were several good performances and I like how they worked interviews with people who knew the real Bernie but I kept expecting more and nothing really happens in this movie.I would recommendnot spending your money or time on this one.
1,Totally boring films of Kenneth Anger,I tried to get interested in these films but was only able to watch two.Total garbage.
1,Written with a bias...Pre-implantation genetic screening is not baby engineering!,"1 Star only because this book is well written. The plot is manipulated (to the point of being completely unrealistic) to make a case against pre-implantation genetic screening. If you know the story of the Denver-based family this book was inspired by, this book will upset you. Facts are twisted. This results in the spread of misinformation and is hurtful to those unfortunate enough to be in a similar situation. Genetic screening is not baby engineering. Why would someone want to turn something that was so helpful to a family into something so awful?"
1,What garbage!,"Could I please have that 2 hours of my life back? I am one of the world's biggest SCI-FI fans, and I thought this was utter (insert profanity of your choice here). Dark (as in impossible to see), unintelligible, and frustrating as hell."
1,WJ Journal on Kindle,"I was very satisfied with the Journal on the Kindle, although I was unhappy with the New York Area inclusion since I live in Long Beach, CA. However, when I was informed that the price was going up to $15.00 without any rational explanation, I immediately cancelled. I have read the Journal for over twenty years but I believe you can get better information and even better editorial information off the internet for free. I wonder who thought up the price increase and if there are others like me who simply decided to move on with the times."
1,Historical interpretaion at its worst,This film may possibly be the worst about this topic ever made. The performances are terrible. Particularly Lance Henrikson as Lincoln. He appears to be doing an impersonation of Gregory Peck playing Lincoln and a very bad one at that. The portrayal of Booth seems to come about from the makers of this film watching too many 90s serial killer shockers. I particaularly like the scene where Morrow is wearing granny sunglasses that make him look like a reject from Strawberry Alarm Clock. His portrayal of Booth as the crazed maniac is laughable. The sets however are very credible and appealing. Overall a terrible film. Avoid it unless you are in the mood for a good laugh.
1,Read the articles on the web and save $$$,"I have nothing against the content of the book, except that it's just a slight expansion of the articles you can find on the web. The chess vision exercises are okay, but if you search for Dan Heisman's articles you'll find better. I wonder about a chess program that takes 1500 hours to jump to 2 grades. Perhaps a bit more insight and less drilling might cut this in half. If your looking for insight skip this book the author has none. So if you want the book in a nut shell practice simple chess positions lots and lots of times. His training method does work, I make fewer dumb mistakes against Fritz 8.0, but why pay for it.The author recomends CT_ART 3.0 instead of chess book problems. For my money Polgar's 5334 Problems is far better than program."
1,Totally useless product,"This item had mixed reviews on Amazon, but I decided to give it a try as I thought it might be an easy answer to capturing the ""stink bugs"" as they walked across the ceiling. I assembled it per instructions, charged it overnight and then went on a mission to catch bugs. Not only doesn't it pick up bugs, it doesn't even scare them. This product couldn't pick up a flea. The reason that I gave it one star is that I couldn't figure out how to give it no stars.The good news is that it was purchased from Amazon. Their return policy is excellent and the process is very easy. A good reason to buy from Amazon!"
1,Waste of Money,Very disappointed in this rug - collects a very small amount of litter and the rest goes on the floor. A regular rug with a higher nap does a much better job
1,Don't Waste Your Cash,"Lasted 15 minutes at most. Although I have to say she enjoyed that first 15 minutes. After that we tried everything to patch and repair, after about an hour we had more tape then actual toy left. Wish they would come up with stronger material and keep the basic concept of the toy... just make it durable for kids."
1,Not recommended,"These are yet again not durable at all. As they say ""one size fits all"" is a lie. These are sized for probably a 8 year old or older. I'm glad that I bought them when they were only 3 dollars instead of 7 or $11.99. I would NOT have purchased these for anymore than 3 dollars. They should be a simple dollar because that's how cheap they are. They are pretty much useless for our almost three year old daughter. They do not fit her at all but she will still try to wear them. I can wear them very tightly it's pretty sad and I'm 18 years old a size 7 1/2 in womens. DO NOT buy these. waste of money."
1,"No QC Here - pump did not work, and shavings found inside.","I thought of the Gilmour 2000P potentially as a high-end, quality product, and made in USA to boot. Boy, was I disappointed:It came with green plastic shavings from manufacturing filling much of the pump cylinder, sticking to the grease they spread in there. Once I cleaned that mess out, I discovered the pump itself had a distorted and damaged pump plunger head, so without a full seal, you could not pressure it up at all. I guess it would have worked fine as a green plastic wastebasket.All in all, a total disappointment, so selected refund vs replacement."
1,Don't buy this product!!!,"The only good thing about this product is that it doubles up as a portable hard drive. Other than that, I received Disk errors right away and reformatted it at least twice. The Tech support and Customer Service was just horrendous. I had an email thread (because there is no 800 number either) trying to work it out with tech support spanning over 3 months.Forget about running with this thing on the trail. Even while i was on the treadmill at the gym wasn't even holding it (it was stationary on a holder), the hard disk flaked.The user interface is a beast, and to scan through only 3 GB of music was a time investment.On top of that, the $50 rebate never came either. Boooooooooooooooooooo!!!"
1,"So, Amazon allows bootlegs to be sold now...?!?!","This program has not been released on DVD, so this is definitely a pirated, illegally made copy. These are easily found through Ebay sellers in the $20-$30 range."
1,Huge Disappointment!!,"I can't agree with the previous comparisons more. What an insulting flop! While I did enjoy the production value and the concept of the film, it's all wrong!! Give me Aliens Vs. Predator in space! The whole thing should have happened on another planet and in the future. And to think they continue to ruin this story again in AVP2!Another point astray from the original scripts...In the first two Predator films, the Predator comes to hunt in very warm hot climates. This tells me that these reptilian-like creatures wouldn't fair well in sub-zero temperatures.New script please!!"
1,Shuts off after a few seconds,This microwave stopped working after 6 weeks. Now it shuts off after a few seconds now matter what. Very cheaply built. You have to be careful not to damage the piece of paper that is used to diffuse the microwaves.
1,11 ozs does not = a pound,tarp not close to 8x10 almost a foot short all around went local bought one that really was 8x10 was heavier came with bungee tie downs and 1/2 price. Cheaper then return shipping would not recommend
1,What's so funny?,"Ugh.. worst book ever. I wanted sensible, practical advice on how to begin toilet training my 2-year-old daughter. Instead, I got a book that belongs in the ""humor"" section! I think Dave Barry could have given better advice!"
1,tiny,"Although it lists how tall this toy is at 13"", it still looked very small to me, especially for the price of 19.99 plus shipping. I was a bit disappointed. The toy is very soft however, which is nice for cuddling."
1,Not happy with this product,"I am not very pleased with this product. I couldn't understand why my cat kept getting sick. Now I know why after searching online and reading other reviews. Other cats have been getting sick on these too! My cat really loved the Greenies, but they certainly didn't love him back. I will never purchase this again and I have found Whisker Lickins in the grocery store that my finicky feline has decided are worth his effort :o) I wish I could give this a positive review, but I can't . . ."
1,"Super convenient, but couldn't hold up to ""solid food"" smells","I've used the Diaper Dekor since the birth of my now 7-month-old daughter and I loved it to begin with. Very easy one-hand use--step on the pedal, drop the diaper through the flap, very easy to tie off a bag when it became full. In the beginning, it handled odors well too; even smelly diapers didn't cause problems. But as soon as I started feeding solid foods, things changed. It proved completely incapable of containing the ghastly stench of those diapers. My daughter's room is at the top of our stairs, and the stench didn't just fill the room, it flowed out her door and down the stairwell, so we were treated to a powerful whiff every time we walked upstairs. I took to leaving her window open and the fan on to air out the room during the day and emptying the pail before bedtime at night in order to prevent it from stinking up the house. That lasted a week -- I just bought a new pail (a Diaper Genie 2) and I hope that works better."
1,"""Hit the lit button""","I was so excited to buy the Phil Harmonic when I was still pregnant and the first stage is really soothing with beautiful music. And I still used it with my baby for the first few months. But then as the stages progressed the less soothing and interesting it became. To be honest the games in the fourth stage don't even make sense! It fact it's really annoying! Rather then let the child explore the sounds and music while pushing and sliding the buttons at a normal pace, the child hears ""hit the lit button"" over and over and over. Sad to say this one is collecting dust somewhere in my garage."
1,DIsgusting -- gave me an instant headache!,"These are so gross I can't believe I wasted my money on them. They gave me an immediate migraine from the overwhelming artificial-smelling fragrance. I am NOT that picky an eater and I generally love any GF cookie just b/c I am so grateful they exist. But OMG I immediately spit this out AND rinsed out my mouth! Even my snack-loving toddler didn't like these. Eating them, that is. She did have a great time massaging it into a fine powder which takes almost no effort at all. What a mess. And what a waste of money."
1,Bad quality,"I've bought several pairs of these shoes over the years, but I'll never buy them again. They're not leather anymore, and, worse yet, they aren't even remotely the same size they used to be. I just received a pair with one shoe much smaller than the other. Time to return these and find a new brand of shoes."
1,Science Fiction at its Lowest,"Amazingly disapointing book by someone who is touted as one of the great German science fiction writers. I used to read lots of science fiction and nowdays dip into the field now and again to see what's happening.This was a chilling read that I hope will not soon be repeated. The writing quality was fair, but the whole story turns out to be one of the most amazing (read bad) shaggy dog jokes I have ever been the victim of.The ultimate explaination of the central mystery of the book is so lame that I really regret ever starting this book. If the journey had been better I could have forgiven the ending, in retrospect, I should have just skipped forward to end to get it all over with a final whimper.Bleeehh."
1,Let's hope the field can do better than this,This book is about 400 pages too long. Postcolonialism and Cultural Studies approaches to problems deserve a better advertisement than this costly bit of charlatanry.
1,Worthless without illustrations,"The text in the kindle version contains references to over a 100 illustrations, yet there are none present. A topic will be explained followed by an illustration of some music or a notation convention but all you see is ""[Illustration]"" in place where the actual illustration would appear. I guess I shouldn't expect more for 99 cents.""MUSIC NOTATION AND TERMINOLOGY"""
1,Maybe for a picnic!,"I won't throroughly lambaste this set because it was only $25. However, I purchased it because another reviewer stated that it is very ""heavy and sturdy"". When I received the package, I was very surprised that it weighed so little! This is the type of flatware that may bend if too much force is applied. It might be nice for a picnic or outing, or as an extra set that rarely gets used, but I would caution against purchasing it for everyday use. I hope this helps."
1,Thoroughly disappointing...,"I was really excited at the thought of reading this book, I'd been looking for it for a couple of years before I finally snagged a copy. The premise would lead one to think it would be a hilarious book...I was greatly disappointed.There are too many characters (what the (...)was the point of Irene?), the sub-plots are confusing and have little or nothing to do with the main story itself. And worst of all, it's just not funny. Fortunately I only paid $2 for it, I wouldn't pay much more than that."
1,drivel,"Horrible. Terrible. Not good at all! Simply another rip-off only this time, instead of the dead hand of Charles S. Jones, Greenfield has elected to rip-off John Yarker."
1,I hate Algebra and I hate this book!,"I'm right on the verge of graduating and the only thing standing between me and my degree is this stupid College Algebra class, filled with useless information that I'm quite certain I'll never use again! Ok now that I've vented about that, I must say that I cannot understand why my college switched from Blitzer's College Algebra 2nd Edition to this text. As you may have guessed this isn't my first attempt at passing this *#$% class. A few semesters ago when I took it we used Blitzer's book, and while it was still Algebra and fairly loathesome, at least it was somewhat understandable! This book is clearly written for students who are good at advanced math and plan to go on to higher math. (Talk of Calculus in the pre-chapter! God help me!) Ok, so what if you don't plan on doing that? What if you are just taking this class because your state government says you have to or you can't graduate? I wish someone would write a Collge Algebra text for the rest of us!!!"
1,Be careful,Please be careful. My wife used this product and received a severe facial chemical burn. Consult a doctor before using.
1,chewed it up in an hour,A real dissapointment. Our Golden Retreiver bit through the rubber in a matter of minutes. even ate a few pieces from it and then smelled like rubber! Don't waste your money IF your dog likes to chew her/his toys. Otherwise its a cool toy.
1,I want my money back,"There are some books you get that after the very first line, paragraph, page you simply can't put them down. You spend every minute that you can etch out of your day reading. The dishes pile up in the sink, the cat circles your feet and then sits yowling in the corner waiting to be fed, the kids eat 3 minute noodles because that is all the time you will take out to cook dinner and you read and you read and you read. And at that last page the smile spreads on your face and out comes the contented sigh of a booklover that has sampled life's finest and nothing can be sweeter.Then there is trash like this that cost the earth and leaves you feeling as bitter and twisted as the characters it contained. Ms Cornwell has quite simply lost the plot - if anyone finds it please return it to her so she can go back to writing the amazing novels she used to."
1,There is better material out there...,"These videos must have been shot in the late 80's/early 90's. This set is full of bad acting, not very attractive actors & actresses, and the information found within can be discovered for free on countless websites on the net. My wife and I actually laughed while we watched the videos and were unable to take any part of them seriously. There are better instructional video material out there for your hard earned dollars."
1,Better Left to Memory,"If you remember this mini-series from 90/91 and are seeking to own a copy, know that you'll be getting a watered down version of what originally aired. The DVD version comes in at 130 minutes - while I don't remember the exact running time of the tv series, it was probably in the neighborhood of 270 minutes given that it aired on three nights.So as you can see, about 1/2 the footage was cut taking out significant character and plot development. The final product is an odd collection of edits not doing justice to either the true story or original version.If you're looking for some of Benicio Del Toro's earlier work, this foots the bill though certainly not in a manner it could have with the unedited version.All in all, a rather disappointing product from editing to special features (virtually none)."
1,"Works, sort of","I bought this because I needed an inexpensive way to balance my mower blades. It does this, but is difficult to use and is not very sensitive. A blade has to be severely out before you can tell on this, and the tool has to be resting on a level surface to be accurate. This tool also pivots both directions (laterally and longitudinally), so it is difficult to tell where the heavy side really is. This is better than nothing, but just."
1,Review From One Book At A Time,"I hate giving classics bad reviews. This book was not for me. Nothing captured my attention and I found that I had to force myself to read it. If it had been any longer I would have stopped. It did catch my interest a little in the end, but not enough to redeem the book in any way."
1,Music for Elevators,"Mantovani has gained a reputation in some quarters for producing ""beautiful"" orchestral versions of standard pop songs; in others, his arrangements have been compared to ""elevaor music"" - the kind of material once used in institutional settings like malls, elevators, and dentist's offices. In short, we have lifeless, bloodless cover versions of pop standards that by themselves have been regarded with disdain by many listeners.This impressive compilation contains a bounty of those sweet violins and voices in a style that has long since passed its usefulness. The best moments are campy and unintentionally funny, as when Mantovani attempts ""contemporary"" hits by Nillson his ilk. This is orchesetral music for people who have never benefitted from a grounding in the classics. Compared even to outfits like Sounds Orchestral, the sound is drab and musty. It's hard to imagine anybody listening to this kind of thing anymore."
1,don't waist your time..,"I won't even waste my time on telling you how bad this ""game"" is. Don't even think it is educational with the word ""phonics"" on the cover--all I can say if the child can jump and move Shrek around well in this game THEN he/she will be waaaay advanced to decide if a letter is in capitals or not...and Shrek moves around in the same manner in all the games--a bore."
1,A Waste of Time,"I've always loved H.G. Wells' ""Time Machine"" and was really excited when I found this book. I managed to get about halfway through it before I finally decided why bother reading anymore. The narrator spends most of his time questioning and whining over just about everything and the plot becomes unmercifully confusing and complicated. I found myslf struggling through a book whose main character I could no longer stand. Save your money, take a pass on this one."
1,Developing a POOR history,"Had the same problem as second reviewer...it POPPED,FRIED, then smelt of burnt plastic/wires after less than 10 flashes. Sadly it was a gift, too. I'll be testing amazons RETURNS performance soon."
1,Vogon Poetry,"Confusing, overblown, impenetrable, repetitive garbage completely lacking character development and coherent narrative.Utter crap."
1,Good but not as good as his two earlier recordings,"Contra la corriente is a good CD but most of the songs are too slow and lacking the salsa flavor of his two earlier recording ""Todo a su tiempo"" ""A Otra Nota"". If you are looking for Salsa for dancing from the heart go with ""Todo a su tiempo"" if you are a fan of ballads and are not into salsa dancing then ""contra la corriente"" may be a better choice for you."
1,I rate this product is below than 0. Shouldn't buy this prod,I definitely agree with V Brown. This is beyond question the WORST printer I have ever owned. Hewlett Packard should know this already but nothing improved!!!. Why I could say this? Coz I have sent it twice for servicing in the service center but it came with the same problem.I cannot print a simple job over two pages to completion. Itjams and cannot feed paper correctly. I have jumped throughevery hoop conceivable and nothing resembling a decent outputover two pages even worst that I have to restart all over again the computer to ensure that I could print again. This is to alarm you all. Do not waste your money!!!
1,Overindulgent artists stuck in-between,"2 1/2Make no mistake, there are a couple beautiful songs on here (or at least several which have beautiful parts inside the experimental electronic confusion), but for the most part people who slap the ol' sophomore slump label upon Air's much anticipated follow up to Moon Safari would be in the clear. In labored, pretentious, but shallow structural dabblings the French duo strain for an artsy depth merely hinted at with their spacey, more intuitive debut. Between the often stilted compositions and a few awkward genre leaps, 10,000 Hz becomes clouded by it's own self-absorption. One hardly notices then, quite a few contrastingly solid ideas inserted into the bloated disc, hinting at the more complex, melodically driven approach that would usher in Talkie Walkie's warmer reception."
1,Too much money,Sorry but I'll skip on this last season ...its just plain wrong to up the price on a 50's show like this...its just sad :(
1,Dlink software support is horrible,"Be aware that if you buy this product, the Dlink firmware has historically been released full of bugs that are not frequently corrected. I am looking at Linksys or other routers to replace this one because of firmware bugs when using WPA encryption.Recently, Dlink released firmware 2.45 and then after many complaints, added a note to their site stating that it is a beta version. I would think that a company that had solid firmware would not have to go back and change a released version of firmware to beta."
1,Still no definitive version on CD and probably never will be...,"The only thing I cared about when I picked up the new remastered version of Sgt. Pepper was getting to the reprise and finding out if someone finally had the sense to restore the missing elements of the reprise lost since the original mono LP release. They didn't.The reprise of ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"" is supposed to be the great rock and roll lead-in to our huge finale, and it is absolutely essential to have - in fact, the whole effect hinges upon - Paul McCartney yelling his head off at the end. With that missing, the song is ruined and it remains so.I haven't found out yet on these ""remasters"" if they've restored the missing harmonica on ""Thank You Girl"" or thrown out that horrid dry guitar on ""I Feel Fine"" and ""She's a Woman""....if not, we'll have to rely on those otherwise unnecessary Capitol version CD releases, but as for Sgt. Pepper...no salvation."
1,You Gotta Live the Blues to Sing Em,"Berberian's work is one more example of why writers, especially first-time writers, should write about what they know intimately. It is painfully obvious from his ponderous and endless recitation of his character's physical training techniques and his love for particular kinds of foods, that Viken has nothing else to talk about. Existentialism? Hah! More like pedanticism. Berberian's characters are flat, uninteresting, and tell us nothing new about the Mideast. Where is the conflict in his characters? Where is the multi-layered (and therefore believable) mileu of the cyclist's world? Where are the characters that could provide an alternate perspective on, or at least discuss, the objective reality of terror? Most unforgivingly, where is the drama? Pass on this author, until he decides to write about something he at least sparingly knows, and doesn't have to research from square one."
1,worked great for awhile,"I bought this last year for a summer cabin, so it has only been used periodically over a total span of six months. Suddenly the thing refuses to turn off. We noticed this when the smoke alarm went off last night! It only turns off when unplugged. Not only that, the top unit stopped working completely so all we can do is bake. It was great while it lasted, but I read these same complaints in other reviews so this is evidently a glitch in this particular model. I don't recommend."
1,Hysterical nonsense,"This depicts Three Mile Island as though it was a realization of the movie ""China Syndrome"".Actually no one was killed or injured. The only injuries occured when lawyers rushing to file lawsuits bumped into people at the Harrisburg airport. Radiation release was trivial.All the lawsuits were eventually thrown out of court.The meltdown catastrophe she describes didn't even penetrate the primary containment vessel.Nuclear energy will be crucial as we confront declining supplies of oil and natural gas."
1,Really really boring - yuk!,"Ray Liotta has been in some bad movies, but this one ranks right up there among the very worst. Some reviewers enjoyed the love story, but these two would-be star-crossed lovers were incredibly unappealing to me and dull. This film didn't work for me on either level - boring love story or boring revenge story. I usually enjoy even the bad Ray Liotta movies because he can be so delightfully crazy, but he isn't quite crazy enough in this one even though he's the bad guy (he does make an attempt toward the end to come through, but it's too late by then - anybody who has stuck with the movie this far, doesn't really care by now.). If you really want a star-crossed lover's tale, surely you can dig up something more exciting than this one; and there are definitely better revenge plots out there than this one. I wanted to smack Alan and Ella by the end of the movie for being such sappy idiots. They deserve each other."
1,Hard to work junk,"We bought this clock two months ago, and finally threw it away. When it worked, it kept good time, but It would frequently stop working and just start spinning. This would go on until the battery was removed, and replaced. It would reset, and work for twelve hours, and then do the same thing. It is not worth the trouble."
1,3rd broken Bodum,"I love coffee from the french press however, i hate having to buy a new one every month. I was a loyal Bodum Customer for the last 4 years but this is 4th Bodum that has broken since April so I finaly switching to another brand. It's either the glass or the filter plate that brakes. I loved you but it's time to leave you."
1,Buyer Beware!,I own 2 TeraStation Pro's. A 1TB and a 4TB. They do not work as advertised. Buffalo Tech support does not keep promises. The marketing and manuals for the product appear to be fraudulent. This is a company to avoid!
1,"Ok, but the cutter broke the first time I used it.","The crimper works fine, but the cutter broke the first time I used it. I contacted the seller about a replacement, and never got a response."
1,Why put down free enterprise?,It's beyond me why people who choose not to take advantage of the free enterprise system wants to put down the successful people who do. Amway is an opportunity for anyone to achieve success in their own business. It has everything to offer an entrepanuer. Amway is and will continue to be a driving force in commerce all around the world.
1,Amazon recommended incorrect case for my product model,"I was not happy with this purchase because The case Amazon recommended was not the correct one for my product, the Stiletto II, it is for the Stiletto I. However, when I purchased my Stiletto II, Amazon recommended that I purchase this case. Now I am left with a case that does not fit my product."
1,Break quickly. Waste of money.,"Bought two of these and both snapped within weeks. Total waste of money. They're impossible to adjust too. There is a guide but the guide seems to be incredibly inaccurate. We just had to keep turning it and trying it over and over, getting rather wet and irritated."
1,Unimaginative percussion,"I love cha cha. I love Broadway tunes. This disc is a great idea, but it is very poorly recorded. The brass gets lost, especially the trombones. It sounds like they are off in a cave somewhere. It makes me want to drink, not dance. Save your money and seek something with more pizzazz."
1,BAD,"NO LO COMPREN ES MALISIMO HUELE RARO Y ME LLEGO EN COLOR BLANCO NO NEGRO COMO LO PEDI, el producto es muy pesado.Don't buy it its too heavy and they send me a different color, a white one."
1,A Waste,I was super excited to try this toilet paper as we've been attempting to move to all recycled paper products in our household. This was a huge disappointment. A roll lasts less than half as long as a normal Charmin-type toilet paper roll. How is it helping the environment when they have to package twice as many rolls as a common type of toilet paper?
1,Very slow,"This networking product is very slow. The utility it comes with reports 50 megabits, but I am get less than 10 via everyother network benchmark."
1,Lame.,"Hillman Curtis is too ""artsy fartsy"" and not enough ""substance"". He busily quotes people he admires yet forgets to finish the projects he shows you and has omissions and errors. Forget this book and go for ""Foundation Flash 5"". You are better off getting a graphic design book or something of that nature as this book is just insufficient in tutoring flash and insufficient on it's own to teach creativity. About the one good thing it does do it show you how to keep your files small. Not worth $35.00 for that information."
1,Sorry Copycat of BAP handbook,"This book was an awful copycat take on the BAP handbook. Eager to pick up where the BAP handbook left off, it fails miserably. This book brings on a fake air of sophistication by use of too many unusual adjectives and french phrases that no one understands.This book makes unreachable middle aged black female entertainers the center of admiration while ignoring the average career woman.Music, furs, and designer clothing are all it takes to be fabulous according to Beautylicious. The coverage of other topics are similiar to reading Essence. A sorry waste of time."
1,Would not buy again,"I was so excited to try these because I love all things cheese, or so I thought, but didn't care for these. They tasted like cardboard."
1,"Crappy refills, don't buy","these are not new, but refilled/recycled cartridges put into Canon pacakaging and taped shut. They didn't work worth a crap. If I wanted refilled cartridges I would have refilled them on my own. This is a big rip-off."
1,"Sentimental, overwrought dreck","The author's style displays more determination than grace, and you can see every join and rivet in her machine-like plot."
1,Why did they add gelatin?!!!,"This was my favorite candy for many years. It was heaven in a square. Then some idiot at Nestle decided to put cow hoofs in it (also known as gelatin). As soon as Nestle makes it vegan again, I will start buying it in bulk."
1,Electrolux EL5020A,"This is a small upright vacuum cleaner. I was attracted to the light weight and the folding design. Unfortunately, this vacuum is difficult to maneuver, requiring significant force to push it across a carpet. Furthermore, it leaves unattractive marks on the carpet. I would not recommend this vacuum cleaner to anyone."
1,Thought I would get a good one,"Had this switch since early March. Resets about once or twice a day. Not good with VPN connections. The case is very hot and I feel that is contributing to the problem. Called support, got India of course. When it does work, it is quite fast. Using with a mix of broadcom and dlink gigE NICs. Will request an RMA and see if replacement unit is better. This is likely the last straw with Dlink products. Two prior routers had issues and support is terrible."
1,Quality - less than a one-star,I have ordered HUNDREDS of dvds from Amazon and this one is the worst quality color that I have experienced.
1,Fantasia sucks!,Consistently annoyingly squeaky performance that's just plain irritating to the viewing public!
1,Looks nice but WAY TOO SMALL,"I purchased this cage today for my new hamster. It is way too small for her, and honestly I think it is too small for any rodent. I think you could use it as an add-on if you already have some other cages (i.e. connect with tubes) but as a single unit it is too small. I will be returning it to the store tomorrow and looking for a bigger cage for my poor little hamster."
1,"ultraviolet digital copy, no thanks.","Bring back the regular digital copies. I refuse categorically to buy anything with an ultraviolet digital copy. Using Flixter to stream a digital copy is terrible strategy. Unless it can be copied onto my devices, I don't want it. When the streaming servers go dark, and they will go dark, you will be left with nothing.<edit>The movie itself is great. It is a wonderful adaptation of the book. The music is dated, having a hokey 70s sound to it.However, the product itself - a blu ray movie with an ultraviolet digital copy is flawed. I imagine the actual blu ray and/or DVD will be great. 4+1/2 stars for the movie itself.I hope the manufacturers will take note that they are losing sales to inferior digital copies.</edit>"
1,Hymns to the Silence,"I love Van Morrison & I love the 1 CD that actually came to me. However it is a 2 CD set and was advertised as such but only 1 CD arrived. I e-mailed the company that was actually selling this product. They acknowledged my e-mail, but have not done anything to solve the problem at this point. If I don't get satisfaction soon, I doubt I will ever order through an Amazon 3rd party vendor again."
1,Does not Explain Steps,"I have bought many exercise videos over the years and this one though is a decent workout it is hard to follow. There are not good transitions, as she moves from exercise to exercise without really telling you what is going to come next. So I felt like I got left behind often, unlike many other DVDs where I was able to anticipate the next step easily."
1,Don't buy gateway laptops.,Customer support is very poor. It will only work for 6month if you are lucky. Then gateway will fix something to work for another six months. Then after one year they will say your warrentty is over they can't help you. Pl go for some other vendor.
1,Eh. Not so good. Reminded me of Water World on Land.,Was not very entertained. This movie seemed like a cross between Water World & a bad Western (would say Tombstone but cannot compare a classic to this one). The dialogue and story line were left a lot to be desired. Found myself bored many times while watching and the story had many holes. Not worth renting...
1,BAAAAD,"It arrived in a box but the box had a grocery bag in it, I assume the fuel was in the bag but the bag was ripped open with the fuel just rolling about inside. The fuel was in a plastic bottle not metal like picture has on website. The bottle had no seal under cap and also their was fuel on bottle. I would NEVER refer this fuel to anyone."
1,Doesn't deliver,"I received this book as a gift. At first glance the recipes looked good, but what I was really looking for was easy wholesome veggie recipes. Instead the recipes and take more work than I have time for and use a lot of fake meat (soy) which we do not eat in our house. The 5 or 6 recipes we did make were not even that tasty. I will get my vegetarian slow recipes from internet searches from now on. I will be giving this book away."
1,Very disappointed!,"This Hot Gel Dispenser by Conair at $19.99 may give ""A Better Shave"" as advertised, IF one could actually get it on the can! We've had several dispensers before, but this one is impossible. I'm not wasting my money to even send it back, it's going in the trash. Buyer Beware!"
1,"Mouse goes crazy, pad unusable","The jell pad feels great but it is of no use because my mouse pointer is unstable.I can't get the mouse pointer to stay still or to move in a straight line. I checked the cord, I restarted the computer, I checked the mouse for driver updates, I checked START, PROGRAMS, ACCESSORIES, SYSTEM TOOLS, SYSTEM INFORMATION, Problem devices and found no issues. I also ran MS Diagnostics. Nothing bad found.I removed the mouse pad just so I could write this review. What good is this pad if it caused my pointer to go wild? Not happy."
1,Very Disappointing,"I purchased 4 spindles hoping for the best but was disappointed right from the start. Due to very lax packing on Amazon's part, one of the spindles was completely broken, bits of it floating in the box. The disks were still on the spindle and, thanks to the little foam circles at the top and the clear plastic disk at the bottom, the disks themselves appeared to be undamaged. I tried to burn 11 disks selected at random from the entire spindle and only 5 wrote. And at least 2 of those had verification errors. I packed them all up, including the remaining disks from the broken pack, and sent them back.These were about $.09 cheaper per disk than the others I'd been buying from Uline, but when more than half don't write, it's no longer a bargain. I'll stick with my Uline DVDs from now on."
1,"A disappointment, and here's why:","Let's face facts. Lots of well-known bands/singers on the Godzilla Album, but many of them were horribly mainstream, which explains the pitiful quality of many of the songs. The only actually decent songs on that entire CD are RATM's No Shelter and Silverchair's Untitled. O yeah, and DOTN's Running Knees is alright. Otherwise, though, the songs just weren't what they should've been. Many artists on that CD have gone so mainstream, their song quality has really diminished...although most performers on that CD are just plain bad. All in all, a major letdown. Is it worth the 3 good songs? With the lack of singles...still debatable."
1,Olympus camera is bad to the core,"Product was received in new condition.Camera had focus problems from the start (understand that this camera was purchased to provide a point and shoot alternative to my standard Canon 1D Mark II system equipment).After numerous calls to customer service and about 6 months of use the camera finally refused to power on.Olympus customer service was contacted once again, I was thinking that they would simply exchange the camera.They told me sorry, buy something else.I will never ever purchase anything else that is manufactured by and/or sold by Olympus.Obviously quality control and customer service are not on their list of must do operations.PS The rating system requires that I enter a minimum rating of one star. Frankly I tried to enter a minimum rating of ""0"" stars, the product is crap."
1,Terrible Just Terrible,Do yourself a favor please dont buy this book!!! save your dollars..this book will be better off as a paper weight!!
1,BFS on the March...,"I don't know what it is with BFS. This is a great ITV adaptation of Defoe's Moll. Unfortunately, BFS's transfer does not appear to do this superb show justice. There is no information on the BFS website about the aspect ratio of the transfer. The original is widescreen (1:66 or 1:78). The BFS transfer is, if Amazon is accurate (not always the case, by the way) 1:33. So if you don't mind missing a significant part of the show buy it. As for me I will stick with the ITV release in the correct oar I purchased some time back and will remain annoyed by the BFS tradition of not telling consumers anything about the oar on the packages or website and of and transforming a widescreen film or TV programme into a TV screen box oar. Pathetic and sad. I expect more but I never get it from BFS."
1,Stopped Working After the First Use,"I used this on my average size driveway while the snow was just a couple of inches. It worked great the first time I used it, but during a second snow storm, the motor started smoking. I opened the side panel and could see the belt was off its track. I had to take it to an authorized Toro dealer and repair store who contacted the Toro company and informed them that the motor was inoperable. The Toro company decided to send me a new machine which I am supposed to receive sometime in August or September, 2010. We'll see what happens. Overall, I do not feel this snow thrower is reliable and was disappointed with not being able to get any reasonable use out of it. I am probably better off buying a small gas snow thrower for next season."
1,WHAT'S THIS THING MADE OF???,"Whatever material this thing is made of, it's definitely NOT spongy. The hard plastic apparatus is covered in a removable (good!)pad with a mesh cover. The ""business"" end of the thing--this hard pad and cover--are difficult to rinse out and re-soap on the fly in the shower. It's not very user- or skin-friendly. It seems to require two people to use effectively or safely, which is counter-productive to the independence it should afford those with reach problems."
1,Poor quality and design,"Just purchased this manufactured version of the classic game and found it to be terrible!The pegs the code makers has to enter to give clues to the code breaker are entered on a square pattern of holes!... which bears not resemblance/mapping to the linear arrangement of pegs for the code breaker! With the absence of this one-to-one mapping of the peg positions, it becomes very difficult for my 6-8 y old! (I suspect this un-natural arrangement of peg holes is to circumvent the original patent! -- Can't see any other reason why!?!).The colors are off colors (not like the original).The construction is very light platics (not $13 worth!).The design of the mask for the code maker is cumbersome, even for small children fingers (I miss the simplicity of a removable mask like the original).All these negative features negate so much of the pleasure of this game that I'm returning it and will try to find the original!"
1,Oxo Can Opener,"This device appears at first to be an excellent product. However, very soon after I acqauired the product, two errors occurred: (i) the magnetic lid device began to malfunction, since the cutter did not sever the lids all the way around; (ii) and more importantly the product fell apart after two months, because the small pin at the top of the product holding the two halves of the product together fell out or otherwise failed. I was able to reassemble the two halves by reinserting the pin and fumbling around and finally reseating the two halves. However, at this price, such failure so early in the product's useful life is unacceptable."
1,"Pad leaks, don't buy","I bought 2 of these for my wife and me and now they both leak. We might have gotten 2-3 leak free uses out of them. I determined that they leak around several of the pleats. I was unable to patch due to the location and shear number. I rubbed rtv silicon on all the round pleats with no luck. It still leaks down within an hour or 2. The other one may last half the night. Now neither of them is worth more than a 1"" piece of foam."
1,This product is non-functional,Both my daughters have a password journal and once you set the password good luck ever getting it open again. My girls have to break into them with a screwdriver since the password option NEVER functions properly. This is by far the biggest waste of money on a product I have ever spent!
1,Victorian melodrama in a sari,"In the typical Victorian potboiler, the bad temptress repents, rejects her sexuality and ends up either dead, or humbled and living in a convent. Fast forward to the United States in the present-day and you have The Vine of Desire. This novel features stock characters (with an Indian patina) and a cliched plot. The writing alternately gushes and stammers. The female characters have three dimensional moments but the male characters are one-dimensional cardboard."
1,Great Picture......while it lasts,"I have had this television since nov of '05. I replaced my first lamp after about 2 months. The second bulb lasted a year (hooray) but these bulbs cost $300 a piece. Not good. Please, do your research, and do not buy this televison. I regret it everyday."
1,So disappointed... Not at all what we need,"We a wanted nutritional help-mate for raising our vegetarian baby. Despite the title, this is a strictly vegan (no dairy, eggs, honey, etc...) bible that suggests a baby begin eating a soy-filled diet at 9 months, and processed soy-foods such as soy yogurt as early as 7 months! The book is preachy and filled with less than helpful tidbits - such as suggesting your child could develop diseases like Crohns if he/she eats dairy."
1,Almost Forever,After reading the first twenty pages I quit. Very Very Boring. The story line was just to slow. More romance than mystery.
1,Academic,"The articles in this book are great reading. They provide thoughtful insite on many different topics. The cases, however, are completely useless without the instructors' manual. As best I can tell, the instructors' manual is not available for purchase unless you are using this book for a class. Therefore, in my opinion, this book is a poor value outside the academic world."
1,neverending confusion,"Smokin' Aces is basically a pretty-looking low budget film. The storyline is about as unorganized and confusing as it gets, because the entire first half of the film is nothing but one nonsense barely-understandable segment after another, while the second half is a small improvement with lots of violence, gun shootings and blood to bring the viewers back from their sleeping state.Looking back however, it's just a failed attempt at an action movie that tries *so hard* to be entertaining, but the constant shifting around from one segment to another makes it almost impossible to enjoy on any level. Maybe it has some funny segments (such as the kung fu fighter striking near a guys face, and another segment involving a guy playing with a dead guys face) but overall, these funny segments just make it harder to take the action parts seriously, and it wasn't good enough of a movie overall to take seriously in the first place. Just don't even waste your time."
1,Great Costumes!,"The costumes in this movie were incredible! I mean, the actors looked so much like real fishermen, I could practically smell them. Then they opened their mouths... The dialogue in this movie is so bad, it's hilarious. I grew up in a small fishing community: my father fished, my brothers fished, my neighbours fished. It cracks me up to picture the lot of them, on a fishing boat, cheering,""Let's fish!"" like a bunch of high school football players. And I laugh to the point of tears everytime I picture any of them saying,""I just LOVE to fish!"" like George Clooney. Pah-leeze! Who wrote this stuff?!"
1,Dissapointed,"Unfortunatelly, the DVD came only in English language, and not with the Spanish Language Option, as the first DVD I bought of Phineas and Ferb.I really don't know why the change in the configuration, but it meant that my son didn't like it."
1,HORRID,"Only good songs on this CD are the ones eveyone has heard already (Deja Vu and Ring The Alarm.) Irreplaceable will probably be the next single. It is ok. The rest of the songs are so juvinile in the songwriting area. Not much thought behind them and the worst song on this entire CD infact the worst song Beyonce has ever recorded is FREAKUM DRESS. This song has no melody, no good beat. Sounds like an 8 year old wrote the music and a toddler wrote the words. I would give this CD one star. Only thing that saves it from getting a 0 is the fact that two of the songs on the CD are better than average and close to excellent. Do not buy this CD sight unseen ( I mean without listening to it yet.) Does not have mass likeability. There is a 70 per cent chance most people will find that there are not enough good songs on this CD to justify buying it."
1,Broke after two weeks of use.,The bench broke at the point where two legs cross and where the big screw inserted to adjust the height. One of the legs bent at that point and broke. I contacted the seller (Endless Variety) and we will see what happens next.Update - The seller returned the money for the broken bench by the next business day.
1,Another bad review,Yes this another bad review for this book. I was lucky that I was able to look through the book in the store before purchasing it. So I didn't end up wasting money on a book that wasn't helpful. I was looking for a book to give me simple hairstyles for natural hair that a hair novice would be able to do. The majority of the styles were for people with weaves or extensions. There were a few styles for people with short hair. However if you are in between lengths and don't want to put in a weave you were out of luck. You can find better info looking on the internet and spending nothing than buying this book and getting nothing.
1,A horrible book by a horrible person,"I stopped reading this after a few chapters. I didn't even care what happened with Mr. Latte. The pair of them are too annoyingly perfect for me. Even her faults are too perfect, as if she needed to create an interesting personality by admitting that, yes, she, too, can make mistakes. Little ones. Fortunately, they don't get in the way of her beautiful life in ""New York's most fashionable restaurants with discerning foodie friends."" Gag.This was a gift from someone who thought I'd enjoy a book about life as a food writer, since I love to cook and daydream about becoming a food writer myself. I returned it for a real cookbook. I can only hope there's more to the food world than what Amanda Hesser sees."
1,Not good for smaller sizes either,"I found that these are not good for smaller sizes (A/B cup)- if you don't fill out the material, then it is hard for it to lie smooth under your clothes."
1,A word of caution,"Seeing the many positive reviews of this Wind-N-Go flashlight, I would like to add a note of caution.Mine was great for a few days when brand new. Bright light wears down fast. Within a couple of weeks,even a hard wind would only keep lights on during the wind-cycle, and immediately go off thereafter.Personally, I consider it a real waste of money -- an overpriced & cheaply manufactured product.I am sticking to my solid old MagLites: tried, true and functioning when you need them."
1,Dean Ornish with a potty mouth,"I thought this would be an informative interesting discussion of being a vegan, but it was a redo of the Dean Ornish type diet with tons of foul language, which was not necessary and a total turn off. If that is what not eating a cheeseburger will do to you, I say get over to Chili's and have one, with fries. There was nothing new or interesting in this book and their ""science"" was questionable. They covered this over by using profanity to describe anyone who thinks differently. If you must read, borrow from the library so you won't feel like you were cheated out of your money."
1,Turgid and disappointing,"Not a fun or easy read. It's disappointing both because it's an interesting topic that fails to be well written and organized, and because the snappy graphics make it seem like more fun than it is. Note that I'm giving it 2 stars on its own merits, as if I (an adult with a PhD) had picked it up to read for my own interest. I'm only reading it because my 14-year old was assigned it for summer reading -- think I'll give her science teacher zero stars!"
1,"Cliche, trite, dull and dim-witted","Isolationist evangelical conservative Christians may feel the need to over-examine mega-pop icon Potter and figure out why the character 'is a good role model after all', but the general population probably has no desire to try to merge the two literary works any more than they'd demand a book explaining how A Clockwork Orange fits into the Battlestar Galactica universe. The simple reason that Harry Potter has similarities with Christianity is that both are based on very old myths and folk tales, and that's about it. Not everything that has to do with good and evil is comparable to the bible. Next someone will be writing a book explaining how The Chronicles of Riddick is an anology for Lutheranism.And yet, this book isn't bad because it's about Christianity, it's bad because it's dull and not overly insighful. Someone had too much time on their hands, and wanted to cash in on the Harry Potter moola-train. This is a must-avoid."
1,AMERICAN CLASSIC NOW WITH GMO SUGAR,"This product contains GMO's Known to cause Cancer and Organ Failure, Im sorry but I will not be feeding my family your cereal anymore until you use safer ingredients. Shame on you"
1,The meaning of selling out...,"Hopesfall, as we knew it, was a screamo band that played hard and stopped for soft breaks, and they did it very well. Transitions are swift, screaming/singing was good. Hopesfall, as we now know it, is nothing quite as creative or good as the original. To put it simply, the band has reversed completely. They begin singing alot, screaming a few moments, like any emo band today. Infact, a-types is a good label, because it's nothing more than another emo cd lost in the mix now. This is the meaning of selling out. Compromising art for money. You could say they changed their sound so they wouldn't be the same, but they changed to a sound that was more bland than the previous. The riffs and drums have gone more simple to set the tone to an emo band. If you were a fan of hopesfall, and high hopes of this next cd being anywhere as good as the first two, you will most likely be very dissapointed, unless ofcourse you're a fan of generic emo."
1,Not recommended!,"I received this bookmark dictionary 2 weeks ago, and it's already broken! The upper left portion of the key pad has stopped working, and the buttons that actually do work need to be pressed hard in order for the letter to register! I definitely DO NOT recommend this item."
1,Reads like a high-school term paper....,"...but unfortunately there are no other FireWall-1 books on the market. I bought it so I wouldn't have to go in cold to my CheckPoint training next week, and I still intend on finishing it over the next two days because it's all I've got until the software shows up.If I had a quarter for everytime the author throws in the qualifiers ""but this is beyond the scope of this book"" or ""this book is not meant to explain this or that"", I could pay for the cost of the book. It reads like a high-school term paper that was cobbled together with index cards of technical notes, but not really providing insight or decent explanations.At the very least I hope there is a little terminology and a few concepts that will be helpful as reference when I sit in class."
1,OK tent for the money...if you don't mind getting rained on,"I would have given this tent 4 or 5 stars if it hadn't rained during my trip. Very lightweight and extremely easy to put up. The porch-type door that can be propped up was great. Especially when it was just raining lightly...I could put stuff under it that I didn't necessesarily want in my tent but wanted to keep dry. As soon as the rain started coming down a little harder (moderate, really) the tent started leaking all over...not something I could patch, just wasn't pulled tight enough. If you're camping in an area that you are sure won't have any rain, this is the tent for you."
1,Not effective on my skin,"I used this product EXACTLY as described. I found that it was excruciatingly hot and not effective at all on my skin. After trying the ThermaClear, I still have a monster pimple on my face."
1,Not impressed at all,"A buddy of mine heard it and just ""had to have it"" after hearing so much of it at the local music store. Well I never heard of them before and I'm very open to music. I don't care what kind it is I'm generally open to all sorts. Well anyways my buddy hypes it all up and I'm eager to listen to it. I've listened to it straight through and I maybe find 2 or 3 songs that are good. The rest just doesn't do anything for me. Maybe the next album will be better?"
1,Stay away from Hamilton Beach products!,"Ever since I got the juicer I didn't like it. First the metal hooks felt off (only after using the juicer few times), then another thing broke. And the noise that this machines makes, I feel like I'm on a factory! I tried to make juice when my son was sleeping, big mistake. I will NEVER buy another Hamilton Beach product (I got a H.B. toaster, I'm about to throw it out as well). Spend a little more money, at least it will be worth it!"
1,Poor Remake of the Original,"This game does not even attempt to bring back the atmosphere of the original Monopoly game. It has several design flaws; the computer plays out of turn, the animations are not synchronized, and, worst of all, the ""voices"" in the game quickly become annoying.Another quirk is that the game fails to offer any method of changing the level of difficulty (e.g., there is no difference in ""easy"" or ""hard"").Also, please note that this game was not written by the true Atari company; instead, Infogrames have changed their name in order to establish a different reputation... I think, however, that they are ruining Atari's reputation!"
1,BEWARE THIS DREMEL WILL BLOW UP IF YOU PUSH IT TOO FAR!,"This thing should come with a warning label! It blew when I was doing detail sanding on hardwood, when it went it blew this black smoke that was very caustic to my throat.Now, I am no stranger to Dremel having had several others, all of which lasted for years, but this model was a lemon. I returned it to the store and they gave me another one, IT DIED AFTER 3 WEEKS OF USE!Keep all Dremels away from heavy use, keep them for quick cuts or light sanding and if you have to work them let them cool often, they just don't hold up like they used to especially this model, don't push it too far or BLAM!"
1,Doesn't last very long...,"I bought one to webcam with and it worked fine until 7 months (but only about 6 uses) later. Sound only comes from 1 side of the headphones now. I bought a set for my boyfriend 4 months ago and his is now also malfunctioning on one side. It worked well while it lasted, but it's pretty terrible that the headset hasn't even lasted a year. In addition, we have by no means put it to heavy use. So this product IS cheap, but don't expect it to last longer than a couple months before you have to invest in another one. If only I hadn't bought that second set for my boyfriend. What a waste of money."
1,Noise Creating Headphones,"I've tried several versions of headphones (Bose QC2, QC3,Sennheiser PXC300, Sony MDRNC60), these fit the most comfortably around the ear, but there was a very sharp, shrill loud whistle sound out of the right ear cup when I rested my head against the seat or window of the airplane.Although the set felt sturdy, the plastic cups felt kind of lightweight and cheap. I'm so thankful for Amazon's return policy!Out of trying all these, I think I'll go back to Sennheiser PXC300."
1,"Nice, but could not use it","We bought it to hang on the door frame. Unless you have an extra extra wide door frame, this jumper would not work well. When my daughter sits on it and moves around, she will bump to the sides of the door frame. After a couple of tries, we decided to return it and bought her a walker instead."
1,Just buy a offical Microsoft Controller-S,"I dont own this stupid third party controller, but why would I need to? Third party controllers never hold up well and they are never near the quality of the first party controllers. It doesent even seem shaped as good as the offical Microsoft controller-s, and it may have that nasty feel that some third party controllers have. Want to know why this is cheap? Its because its probably horrible. Every one I know who had to deal with a third party controller never liked it. So just dont buy it!"
1,Don't get ripped off!,"I am a huge MMW fan, and as far as I know, there IS NO ALBLUM ENTITLED ""MEDESKI MARTIN AND WOOD""!!! This provides NO track listing and NO description of what you're buying. BUYER BEWARE!!Buy an official album....any one. They're all friggin' great!"
1,The FISH! tank... Scaaaary!,"Actually, this is just a short review after my longer FISH! review, mostly because I found myself rather horrified after reading this ""real world"" application of FISH!Imagine working in a call center in which people would come in dressed as pigs or chickens, or godz forbid, Elvis! You have disco balls rotating overhead, and music. You try to do your job, but you're pounded relentlessly by all this corporate-engineered ""fun..."" Urgh! Someone hands you a plastic fish or a paper fish, and then makes you go ""fishing"" for prizes.Welcome to Job Hell! Run FAR FAR FAR away... This could be coming to a workplace near you.And most of us would rather just have a decent paycheck, with a challenging intellectual environment in which to work. Amazing what happens when the Blanchards and Lundins of this world get into the mix. Disaster!"
1,Is it what it is...,"This is basically a timezone-by-timezone view of the Millenium celebrations at major cities around the world, as shown on CNN that day. At each countdown the major cities are shown together so you can see how each one celebrated at the same time. Video quality about the same as broadcast TV. Audio quality not great. No extra stuff. But you knew it would be this way. Consider it a souvenier and move on."
1,$14.50 to ship a $1.50 Item?,"if this isn't a scam, what is? And amazom lets it happen. This is a pad of paper. I promise to alert everyone I know that amazon is crooked. I intend to post this on facebook and twitter. They may have my money, but bad PR can circle the globe."
1,Noisy,"I purchased this filter for my 80 gallon Cichlid tank. I have had both Marineland Penguin and Hagen Fluval filter canister. I decided to replace the Marineland and after researching online, I decided to go with the Aquaclear 500. The quality of water has definitely improved and it became crystal clear. The one thing I can't stand, though, is how noisy this device is!! I don't mind some 'white' noise, but this thing sounds like someone is drilling next to me! I have to turn it off every night when I sit in the living room or else I feel like my head is going to explode! I sure wish it's not bothering the fish as much as it's bothering me."
1,"Basic story, maybe better for younger readers?","I found myself bored reading this book. I read his book ""Shadows Fall"" and really enjoyed it, but I stopped this one after the first of the three books included were complete. It wasn't a bad story - but it was too simple and lacked depth. I think I might have enjoyed this when I was younger - but to me it lacks depth now."
1,loose,"This didn't even have resistance on the tightest level. It didn't hurt at all but it didn't help either. I'm an average size person, not real large but not a fitness freak either. so maybe its for larger people"
1,Wost DVD Ever,"I bought this DVD beaucuse I really love Nirvana's music. However, it is a lousy instructional movie with low budget. From the picture quality to the clothes on the instructor is just plain - cheap. Curt Mitchell started off the DVD rambling on and on about Kurt Cobain for the first 5 mins, which does not have anything to do with Nirvana's guitar skills. The rest of the DVD just him played riffs after riffs. I doub other DVDs in this ""Guitar Method"" series worth any good either. This is just some cheap DVD made by this company to profit from huge bands. Save yourself some bucks. Instead purchase Nirvana sheet music and play along their CDs."
1,Disappointed,"I waited a long time to read this book, therefore I was very disappointed with the outcome. Pages of name dropping and casual references to animals and tribes. There was no meat or thread of interest to carry the reader through this literal journey. Compared to his other books this was a bomb."
1,Poor description,It should be noted that the adapter is 2.5 mm male to 3.5 mm female. It will not work with an iphone/
1,Release Shin-chan in his original glory!,"They should have released this DVD with the original Japanese uncut video and Japanese soundtracks. It is SO much funnier. I first started watching Shin-chan when I was stationed in Misawa, Japan 18 years ago and have been hooked on it ever since. I've enjoyed the Dragon Ball Z and Dragon Ball series--they are both uncut and have the original footage. Sure, some of this stuff may not be appropriate for children, but parents should have the responsibility to be aware of what their children are watching anyway. Release Shin-chan in his original form and put the entire season in one set instead of this part 1, part 2 stuff--what, are you trying to milk us for money? I hated to see when the Spongebob series started doing that...Don't change the cultural references, so what if some people don't get it--it's a good learning experience!"
1,BEWARE of this boot,"got them this am,shipping them back this pm.Chinese cr*p.Ordered two sizes larger than I wear,shaft/instep area too narrow,can;t get dumb foot into shoe area.Of course this was the problem with LL BEAN and Uuggs,expense and junk from china,they made their money,forget they are JUNK,and don't fit.Got artic packs,old but in good shape and MADE IN USA,guess I'll forget about boots this winter.BY the way those little side buttons are totally worthless decorations of no value.Beware and good luck."
1,Crap,"This turned out to be a cheap piece of crap. It didn't even work right out of the box.I wanted a small AM radio and unfortunately this was about the only one available.I would have gladly paid a little more to get a quality product, but none was available in the small size I needed."
1,NudeFor?no plot.,"Thank God for Instant streaming Nflix,otherwise I would never rent this even if I was paid,the nudity doesn't make for a plot.The Subtitles don't match the dubbed English Dialogue(Italian Film,no Surprise right?)The movie drags on despite nudity from the start(the distribution co apparently runs the credit with nudity).A waste of time."
1,Okay...but gave out after less than a year,"We used the product, admittedly almost daily, for about 10 months before the top latch broke (you now have to hold it down to operate the grinder), but that wasn't the only problem. The 'pause and serve' simply doesn't work, the narrow basket is very hard to clean (and clean....and clean...and clean) and there should be some way to use a paper filter on the days you already have ground coffee. We're upgrading to the Capresso..."
1,Knife and Knife pouch incompatible,I ordered 2 Swiss army knives and 2 pocketknife pouches that were displayed on the same screen and were marketed together. (People who bought the knife also bought ...etc.)The knives came from one source; the pouches from another. The knives arrived as promised; the pouches arrived the following week. The pouch did not fit the knife (knife too large or pouch too small). Free delivery did not apply to the pouches which came from a source in New Hampshire - surprise!
1,"Kind of thankful, but mostly annoyed","When I ordered this it said, ""Some writing in the margins."" What it did not say was that half of the book would be translated in the margins. Almost every page has writing in it. I am somewhat grateful for that because it helps me out, but its a little annoying when I'm trying to read."
1,Boring,"I was hooked the first time I heard their first LP, Vegas, about 5 years ago or so. When Tweakend came out, I thought, decent album, but doesn't touch Vegas.Legion of Boom is a very boring album. Everytime I try to put it in I give it the benefit of a doubt. I figure maybe the last time I listened to it I was just tired, or I wasn't open to a new sound.Wrong.This album is just boring as hell. There is nothing in this album that keeps my attention. For anyone who thinks they are just growing musically, well, just keep thinking that I guess. They sound bored. Maybe they've made too much money with their songs appearing in commercials and movies, and they have just gotten lazy.Come on guys, light a fire under you so we can be wowed again."
1,Unmet expectations,"I'm a huge Bruce Campbell fan, and I had high hopes for Bubba Ho-Tep after reading the synopsis. What I got was a slow-moving, grossly unsatisfying experience. The movie moved poorly and tried to make commentary on growing old and feeling old. It didn't pull me in or make me really care about the characters. It also didn't really have any explanation for current events, only backstory on the main character.There were some entertaining parts, but on the whole it's definitely not worth owning."
1,Nail polish not very good,The book has great ideas for nail designs. However the nail polish itself is not the same colors as on the cover and they come off when you wash your hands. They should have included real nail polish!
1,Chest band a non-starter,"I don't know how this works because when I found that I would need to wear a chest band during exercise to make it work, I returned it. It isn't evident in the advert for this (or any other) heart-rate monitor. I guess I'll have to trust my sense of pain...."
1,poor!!!,"I did not like this album. I think the lyrics are cheap. Where did the creativity go? These last 2 albums sounds like conventional pop rock. The album should have been more poeticand throwing copper-like. On V, Ed sounds like he is trying to be too cool in his singing style."
1,Hohner equals HORRIBLE,"I've been playing Blues harp for over 30 years. Hohner's customer service is despicable. They redesigned these MS Harps (Blues Harp is one) so that you have metal cutting into your mouth. They could have designed it so that the metal plate that the reeds are mounted on are tucked WITHIN the comb so that your lips are in contact with plastic or wood instead of sharp edged metal. Only an idiot would not realize this in designing this highly touted MS system. Forget about Special 20's too, they go bad after just weeks. I'm switching to Lee Oscars. Don't even try to contact Hohner it is impossible. They display complete lack of commen sense in their design and zero concern for their customers. They continue on their steady decline in quality and service. But their marketing is clever. Take my advice, stay away from this company's third rate products."
1,I can create better using my PC,"Well, OK. We've all been duped by the title, including myself. I was pretty upset when I bought it and watched it. The music, although nice covers by other musicians, is not authentic Pink Floyd. That was seriously disappointing. However, since I own many Pink Floyd CDs, I had the idea of making a new CD with the songs on the playlist of the DVD in the same order. So now whenever I play the DVD, I simply watch it, but listen to the CD instead with the real Pink Floyd music. You just need to start both the CD and the DVD sort of at the same time and ... enjoy."
1,A very poor movie,"Sorry to say that this movie is nowhere near the caliber of the Rocky Horror Picture Show, which it tries so hard to be, but just isn't. I expected a lot, but somehow, ended up extremely dissapointed. This movie failed to capture my attention no matter how hard I tried. I think that I would have had more fun watching paint dry on a wall than having to see this movie again."
1,Low Budget,This was a low budget movie. The actors did not quite fit their roles. Some of the guy actors were in a role that they could not get woman but their looks would say other wise. Premise was good but it was hard to get into.
1,We didn't click,I have searched for months for a good commentary on the Gospel of John and it looks like the search continues. I got it based on the reviews I have seen on the book from readers. I guess its different strokes for different folks. I am more of a greek and indepth detials on new testament words. My type of commentary is the classic on Jude&Peter by Bauckham. I didn't get that type of exegesis from Brown.
1,Spaceship Eyes - 'Truth In The Eyes Of A Spaceship' (Cleopatra),"Shaceship Eyes is the side project of former Melting Euphoria keyboardist Don Falcone. One of his other efforts, Spirits Burning - 'New Worlds By Design' is SO much better (see my review). I decided to give this disc another listen because I know several others that actually like 'Truth In The Eyes Of A Spaceship' far more than I do. A so-so trance / electronic release I thought,at best. Had a couple of decent tracks to boot,like ""Mind The Alien"", ""The Great Yew Hedge"" (with guest Harvey Bainbridge) and ""We Need A Volunteer"" was okay. You might enjoy it more than I did."
1,Missing the vanilla flavor!!!!,This is a waste of money if you are looking for the french vanilla flavor it just doesn't have any. I ended up giving away 5 of the 6 cans. The mocha by Folger's is excellent and you can taste the chocolate. I thought the french vanilla would be the same but it was just a sweet coffee. I purchased the Victorian Inn brand and from the reviews this has a good vanilla taste; I hope so because I was trully disappointed in this Folger's French Vanilla.
1,Great Product-- Horrible Customer Service,"I have had a series 5 for 1 1/2 years. I love the size, capacity, features and display. Unfortunately, my Psion broke just in time to be out of warranty. The company will repair it for $160 without guarantee that it won't break again. I have heard from several others that their Psion Series 5 or 5mx also broke shortly after the warranty period had ended. Psion does not offer extended warranties, either. I have had a very poor experience with customer service; they are not helpful, and don't seem to care whether they maintain the customers they work so hard to acquire. Furthermore, I've noticed the company being more stingy, unaccomodating and generally customer-unfriendly over the past few years. I would be surprised if Psion stays afloat given the competitve climate for hand held computers out there."
1,THE BOOK WAS HORRIBLE,"The book was horrible. I found it racist and ignorant. It was actually a boring book, I kept wondering where it was going. It was quite upsetting at the end to think there are no consequences for your actions. Would not waste my time reading it. I am actually happy I took it from the library, and did not pay good money for it."
1,Starts off fine but don't let that fool you!!,"After reading the reviews for this monitor, I registered for it anyway. Several people wrote things like ""Has some static but what monitor doesn't?""... I should have known right then I was in for trouble. We've had the monitor for 10 months now and it was fine at first but the longer we used it the more static it had. I went online and read the manual over and over to try and troubleshoot where my problem was. I tried EVERYTHING it suggested to no avail. In the last month the static has become so unbearable that I had the volume almost all the way down and I could bearly hear my daughter and I could STILL hear the static!! I went out and bought the Safety 1st Soft Glow monitor because all the reviews had 5 stars and now I know why - IT'S GREAT! It is so silent. I'd say go for that one!!"
1,Would never purchase,Base loaded antennas are not worth a damn! center loaded like a Wilson trucker 2000/5000 or top loaded like a Firestik II will out perform this antenna 70%.
1,Slap in the Face,"I've been a TOOL fan since the beginning. This album is a mockery of TOOL's genius. They have twisted the songs to turn them into some sort of techno crap which is the exact opposite of TOOL. If you are a true fan of TOOL, DO NOT buy this album."
1,Top fighter 2 (NFG),This is not an action flick. It is a documentary of very poor quality and is definitely outdated. Do Not buy it.
1,"...an ""excellent use of technology,"" but is it good?","This may be an ""excellent use of technology,"" but is it good? I don't think so. Yes, Ray sings and yes, the Basie band (not Basie) swings (a little), but what I hear is not a real synergy. To my ears, which have heard both Ray and The Count (not together) live on many occasions, this CD sounds fake and contrived. This is not Basie's book it's Ray's, and the band just does not fit with the C&W hits and the other Charles classics. I had high hopes for this album as I am a fan of both Ray and The Count. Call me a stinker, but I've been listening critically for close to forty years and this one just does not cut it."
1,Down with Giancoli,"Will someone please tell the King that he has no clothes on? Will someone please stop stocking Physics departments with books that are simply a flag for how clever we all are. ""Look at this book chaps...""as we flaunt the open text, ""bloody tough to understand, eh?!""Giancoli is accurate and detailed. Giancoli is a fantastic text to dip into (for the most) able student. In my experience of delivering the subject within the English National Curriculum it is hopeless for the 'average' Physics student. Giancoli is black and white in a colourful world. Has anyone that has ordered this book ever seen a Tom Duncan? Have you looked at the Longman series? Streuth!Why do 'we' make it so difficult for people to access our subject?"
1,Conceited book,"Had to offset the praise handed down by so many people for Karourac's writings. Very overrated as a writer. This book is filled with the resemblance of substance, but has nothing in it. It is a contradiction of itself."
1,Another Horrid Recommendation,"If this were a serious production , it would have closed 100 miles outside Boston.There is nothing clever , nothing new , and no genius in this one. Spare yourself."
1,When Love NEVER Comes!,I am so glad i picked up a used copy of this dvd. Generally New Zealand movies are great entertaimnent but this one is not. I was so disapointed. Throughout the movie you wonder who is with whom and what the heck is going on. Was there even a script for this bomb. Skip this one.
1,Careful where you use this...,Within 1 day of using this hose it sprang a leak. We cut and repaired it. Then next day the same thing happened... And so forth. Seems the material is irresistible to rodents. They chew into it.
1,It didn't work for me,"The light just stays on. It's more than 1 foot away from either wall so not sure what they problem is. I put black tape over the sensors facing the wall and that still didn't work.Sucks, because I really wanted this to work. I own a building and I'd rather have the lights turn on and off when people enter the building.I read the instructions completely and not way to deal with it."
1,FaceLift excercises,"This book is a joke. The stick figure drawings do not at all convey how to do the exercises and the exercises themselves are absurd! (Or at least what I can figure out the excercises to be). The excercises in this little book can be compared to trying to make your eye lashes grow by batting your eyes. It's amazing that any publisher would publish a book such as this. Oh yeah, none would. Don't waste your money."
1,Mediocre,"The one-star rating is because justice league doom is simply not worth buying.No better or worse than a standard justice league tv episode.If Warner's wants to continue the show through DVD releases then they should use the familiar animation style along with the regular voice actors.Aside from red hood and I suppose crisis on two earths, the dc Warner's direct to DVD releases have been mediocre, uninspired, and honestly somewhat boring.The whole pg-13 thing just makes these projects too heavy and somewhat depressing and needlessly violent to justify the rating.The fact the brave & bold and young justice were/are so entertaining seems to prove that dc characters fare best with an ongoing series, where a 75 minute cartoon or even a 2 hour live action film just doesn't serve them well ( Nolan batman movies excluded)."
1,"Humdrum Platitudes - if this book helps you, you need help.","A very thin book with not much to say. I breezed though it in 15 minutes as I have read or heard everything before - only much compellingly elsewhere.For starters, wouldn't you think a book on visual aids would be printed in color?Many references to ""the Japanese are smarter than Americans"" school-of-thought which was in vogue in the late 80's.My hope was that this book would discuss specific guidlines on what makes a visual aid effective, but boy was I wrong; only a fleeting chapter on some cliche charts that every factory in the country has been using for 20 years or more, such as the ""192 days without an accident"" you see at every construction site."
1,damaged merchandise,product arrived in a damaged condition due to poor packing and rough handling by carrier. Hose reel returned and credit promply issued and received.
1,"Crazy Author, Stupid Book",This is a BORING book. Most of the chapters are just pointless stories. Neil Postman is nothing but a critic. Avoid.
1,"dumb movie, but if you like dogs","This was a very silly movie with a ridiculous plot. However, it did make us laugh, just don't expect much"
1,Hmmm why would anyone bother,"Everything on this Cd sounds exactly the same and Madonna goes half (...) with her vocals as usual. The lyrics are a pile of crap too... I mean ""I Love New York"".... wow good for you... we don't care!"
1,2 1/2 stars,"The first part of this book is the set up and background story of Adrianne and Philip. You learn about their childhoods and I felt it was really interesting and well-written. I kept thinking wow, I'm really going to feel for this couple because I feel like I ""know"" them. Well, when it finally got to the parts where the hero/heroine interact I wasn't feeling much at all. The chemistry wasn't there for me and I just thought it was kind of boring. I've read 5 Nora Roberts books so far and this is the one I like the least. I will keep on reading them though because I know what she is capable of."
1,review,Am happy with video at this time however the plastic containing the box set was broken upon reciept.
1,Not for me,"I bought this book because it came highly recommended. However I could see almost instantly it is not for me. Where I am in my journey does not require a complete revision of everything I know, using ancient concepts, symbols and possibly ideas."
1,David Oistrakh: Artist of the People VHS,The item arrived within a reasonable amount of time but unfortunately it was falsely advertised. The item was described as being like new and still in the package. This VHS is supposed to come with a booklet which was missing. I definitely would not have bought this product from this seller if I knew that it was not complete. There were many other options to choose from and unfortunately I was misled. When I wrote back to let the seller know that I was not satisfied I did not receive a response. I would not recommend this seller.
1,"Lucky You, Harvey","Funny thing about these can-do, upbeat, never-can-fail people: they all were wonderfully lucky. Resourceful, yes, but lucky. Would Harv (who I've done business with in the past) have dared include stories about a few of the many who never recovered from a firing? Senior managers whose boss was delighted to unload experience to save salary? People whose jobs were shipped to India? There are millions of people who will be thrilled to learn that having been fired from Walmart is just a preliminary step to launching a new Home Depot empire... T'ain't so. But America hinges its fragile hopes to this kind of hokum. And Harvey, bless his tycoon heart, has been thrilling readers for years and getting richer off it."
1,This book does not relate at all to my blood type!!,"I am a type O+. This is a fact. As such, this book recommends that I eat red meat, and plenty of it. Yet I hate red meat, have never eaten it (since infancy!), and find that many of his recommendations for Type O's are not the least bit appetizing or appealing. I do, however, enjoy all the foods recommended for Type A's, and have eaten that way for 30 years- vegetables, lentils, fruits, and grains. I believe that your body will tell you what it needs- do you crave milk? You need Calcium. Are you shaking and weak? You need protein and less sugar! Listen to your BODY, not this doctor trying to make a buck, exercise regularly and sleep enough each night, and and you will be as healthy as ever."
1,Crap,"The author is all over the place with this book and is extremely obsessed with sex as every chapter seems peppered with junk about models being coerced. Not to minimize the accounts, but the book is filled with a bunch of stories of 'never were's' who never made it to the status of Carolyn Murphy or Cindy Crawford whining about how they were taken advantage of and didn't go anywhere with their careers. Ian seems like a pervert in many respects and if he is going 'undercover' to parties where models are being exploited, then he is part of the problem and not the solution. This book is even more slimy than Michael Gross' book. Ian also seems to believe he was a 'model' himself, and looking at his one picture in the book compared to other online pictures of him, it is no wonder he never got anywhere. Piece of crap, glad I didn't pay much for it. Don't waste your time or money."
1,Reallllllly Harrrrddd!,I couldn't even finish this workout. It is really hard I will never another Jilian Michaels workout again because she is really tough in this video and from what I have read in reviews after I did this one
1,= * *,"My expectations might have been set better if the title was something like ""Special Edition Teach Yourself Relational Databases Using PostgreSQL in 24 Hours For Dummies"".I think this book is extremely thin on useful relevant content, although not completely without value; nevertheless, the books ""PostgreSQL Essential Reference"" and ""Begininning Databases with PostgreSQL"" are available now, and in my opinion they are vastly more useful than this book.NB: ""Practical PostgreSQL"" is not out yet as I write this review."
1,Garbage,"What a horrible album. Not one song on this garbage was good. Please get off of Biggi for a change and write some real lyrics ""Puff Garbage""."
1,Goo dried up!,I bought this for my daughter for Christmas because she likes anything gross and slimy. We opened it a few days ago and the goo (slime) inside that is used to play the game is completely dried up and hard. Without the slime there really is no game so its not alot of fun. Guess it has been sitting on the shelf too long??
1,"Can you say, ""Strawman""?","Page after page of vapid ranting relying on ad hominem attacks buttressed by footnotes the National Enquirer would be proud to cite. Not thoughtful, not thought-provoking, but an addition to ditto-head ""uh HUH!"" conformity to whatever outrage du jour (or du hier, so 1970s are his examples) is promoted by neocon ideologues.There are good conservative writers out there; Flynn is not one of them."
1,No vistas!,A his book does not live up to its title. Has nothing to do with vistas or views. Merely a collection of simple building plans in no particular order and of littel interest beyond the ordinary.Keep looking for other books out there.
1,Not what I thought it was,I thought this was an electric company video but mostly it was more of a commentary on how it got started... of absolutely no interest to my children.
1,Over the top...,"...started out ok, but by the end I was worn out. Too much fighting/chasing/shooting/explosions, etc., etc., etc. The original version with Arnie was much better IMO."
1,Zero stars - Never received this item.,Amazon had to reimburse me. The seller never even shipped the product and never responded to my inquiries about the order.
1,"Bland, dull, boring","I had hopes for this film, but it certainly left me lacking, especially the generally unemotional interactions between characters. Most of the movie seemed dark or washed of color. The concepts had so much unexplored potential or was missing some meaty back-history that would have given the present moments more meaning. Some of the CG was nicely done, but not exceptional. Overall, I was just plain bored while watching this film."
1,Too drawn out,"While the film had an interesting premise and was well acted, there just wasn't enough material to fill out a 90 minute movie. This is probably why the filmmakers used endless repetition to draw out what should have been a 45 minute short into a feature length film.If you choose to watch it, I recommend viewing the film up to the point where it reaches the present day at 23:00. Then skip to 39:00 and watch to 53:10. Skip again to 58:00 and watch to the end.You will still see plenty of repetitious and unneeded material. But you will get everything you need out of the film, and have 20 minutes of your life back."
1,Leaky gelcaps,"I can't recommend this brand. The gelcaps are poorly manufactured and they leak into the bottle. You end up with bunch of gooey, foul-tasting capsules (foul tasting because black seed oil tastes foul by itself)."
1,Disappointed,"I love the fact that these bags are made with a high percentage of recycled material.However, they are thin and tear very easily. I ended up putting less content in them and therefore using more bags than the ones I used previously. I am quite disappointed."
1,stings my eyes,"Let me be clear - I LOVE PTR products - but this one made my eyes sting, and i could not apply eye make up on top of it. For now, I am sticking with PTR unwrinkle eye."
1,NOT for a beginner!,A person who is not familiar with object-oriented programming will have tough time understanding this book. Think about getting some other book.
1,Fluff with little substance,"I really liked the secret, what the bleep are we here for and the shift movies. This movie came across as fluff. I honestly feel you would be much better off reading the book than seeing this movie. The book was inspired. The movie felt like a money grab. The movie is only 50 min long and in that time it doesn't say much. I hope I don't sound negative I'm not judging the movie's theme or ideals. For me it was a very underwhelming experience. Maybe being a fan of the book I expected a lot from the movie."
1,It's amazing that it was even published!,"This represents the worst possible reading of Derrida that has, perhaps, ever been allowed in print. He claims that Derrida, de Man, and other deconstructionists want a stable world, and are like children complaining that things are not going their way. I cannot imagine a more incorrect reading. It should be noted that early on in the book he says that he cannot understand Derrida, so the question is: Why is he attempting to make any statement about his work and what it may or may not be after. I am furthered amazed to hear that he was a teacher at Yale.Avoid this book, or better yet, take it upon yourself and read the book and and write another bad review. It is too bad you cannot give zero stars."
1,"A ""steaming pile of dung""","""Artists cannot be hampered by the restriction of taste. We're way beyond that"". Sonny Sharrock (Last Exit Guitarist)Yep, that about says it. Last Exit were definitely not restricted by taste; however, they were caught in the gravitional pull of EXTREMELY BAD taste.This is the worst type of jazz ever imagined."
1,"Bluetooth? Should be ""White Fang""","I concur with many other reviewers that this is a piece of garbage. The keyboard is the problem. I couldn't keep mine connected and the poor thing ended up in pieces on the floor of my office. I've gone back to a wired Keyboard and Laser Mouse from Microsoft. Plus Logitech loads utilities and tools that are always popping up on screen asking you if you want to upgrade. Nonsense. It's a keyboard for crying out loud. I want to type on it, not solve World Hunger. These manufacturers need to stay away from the volume controls and hot keys and make a keyboard that types like it should."
1,Works too well - can't taste the food!,"The product works well, in theory. Locked the food in place with no problem. Easy to grip. But the mesh is super thick and large. My little girl, who loves food and puts everything in her mouth, didn't want to put this in her mouth. She tried it, made an awful face and refused to put it near her face again. I introduced at 6 months, and then every few weeks after that. I've since given up.I don't blame her. I tried to eat an apple slice through it. I got hardly any juice and the feel of the mesh in my mouth was gross. Very unappetizing.Maybe if they had a thinner mesh??"
1,THIS IS NOT A REAL CHI,This is not a real CHI! My real CHI that I had for 5 years was dropped in water and broke. I ordered a replacement on Amazon. When it arrived I knew it was fake. I compared it to my original CHI and the weight of the new one is much lighter and all of the materials used are obviously much cheaper. I've had it for a week and the on light is already starting to go out. They should say that it is a knock off in the product description. I have been ripped off.
1,Misleading,"I ordered this cd because I was under the assumption that there would be positive affirmations along with the nature sounds. There are no affirmations, and the sounds are not even relaxing."
1,good potential,"This is my first review on amazon and my first book by Ms. Jones. I found the Sun Witch to be well written, and the idea of the three sister witches under a family curse very intriguing and plan on reading the rest of the series to see how it plays out. My reason for giving this book only 2 stars is because I just could not like Sophie and Kane. I just did not believe them to be realistic characters and found her transformation from doubting-witch to all-powerful witch to be rushed and rather unbelieveable, and the love between Kane and Sophie to be much to superficial and unrealistic. I'm going to get these books from the library rather than buy the rest of the series."
1,OXO failed this time,"I normally love OXO products, but this one just doesn't work for me. The soap doesn't dispense easily. The pump button doesn't maintain a seal. Would not recommend at all."
1,Shameful,"Full of ambiguous language and outright errors. Seems like a classic case of a publisher taking no interest in content, only sales potential. Was this book edited by anyone knowing anything about chemistry or editing? Not recommended under any circumstances."
1,A waste of my money,"I bought this product, but found that it did not work at all. Not as what it claimed. Wasteed my time and money. Simply warn people who is going to buy it.This is just few of the bad experience I had over online shopping. Most of time, I found that online products have pretty good quality."
1,Fred durst is just wierd,"its strange because the album itself is preety good its just fred durst that puts me off. my generation,my,livin itup,taking a look around and rollin' are good songs but! im taking 2 stars cus of fred durst hes a joke what does he still think nu-metalis alive cus no it died around 3 yrs ago! no1 will ever like limp bizkit ever again because of fred durst thats the reason! we ALL hate him hes stupid pathetic and on tv he gets very arrogant, also sum songs actually suk2 stars-cus of fred durstif fred wasnt in the band it would have been 4 stars"
1,Parts do not fit,"Do not buy.The screws are not long enough, I had to buy longer ones.The rope is too large to fit in the hole for the brake.There is not anchor point to tie the rope down at the end, even though the instructions say there is one (not the wall end, but the e of the pulley system)Does not pull th bike up evenly.Hooks are not deep enough to grasp the bike.There is a reason this is the cheaper version, spend the extra few bucks and buy the good one"
1,Buyer BEWARE!!!,"Ok, i bought this mp3 player for my little brother for christmas, i was excited because it arrived earlier then expected, BUT with a million problems. First, the operation manual, if thats what you want to call it, is one sheet of paper stating the on/off volume and play buttons. I plugged it in, charged it for a day and a half and STILL it will not turn on unless plugged into a computer. Also, i have put some things on it like music and a movie, but it will not show up at all. Also, the ad says 2GB but i only got 1GB. THEE WORST Mp3 PLAYER EVER!!! BUYER BEWARE!"
1,Still waiting,"Ordered this 2 weeks ago, still has not been shipped. No notice or anything. No way of knowing why the long wait!I ordered this a second time and now again 1 week later and still not shipped. What is wrong with this vender? Why advertise something you have no intensions os selling? Still waiting???"
1,Fiero Manual,"This is a generalized manual. It lacks the detail to perform any major work. Some of the photographs of parts are not of the vehicle specifed.Save your money and get the Chilton. Specs in the book are pretty accurate but if your have a big job to do, don't expect the detail you need to accomplish the task."
1,Rattling Ding,"Our fourth machine over the years, our first time online buy, we looked forward to that beautiful box and what a deal for the day, almost half price...BUT once plugged in, IT (the Wahl 4120-200) was intolerable. The noise! The din! The rattling horrid grind! We inspected the thing. It looked like the others we had had BUT the seam splayed a gap upon the spine so unusual, when right on top we saw a small area of over-tightened plates as the spine had been re-glued. They, in a tiny area, ever so slightly, overlapped. ""The thing must have been dropped"" we said and ""They tried to fix it!"" and ""No wonder it was so cheap!"". So we put it back in its beautiful box and pondered if and when we would send it back and if we would order online again."
1,OK movie; average script; poor ending,"This movie reminded me (because of the way it was wrapped up) of ""Boiler Room,"" that movie that contained less than 10 minutes of really good acting (Ben Affleck's cameos), with an OK script, but a lousy ending! Same here... When it was over my wife and I looked at each other like ""What on earth happened here? Is that all?"" The plot, pretty basic: De Niro is Nick: he steals expensive jewels and collectibles for a living and is faced with a very large coup, his last one, where he's joined by Edward Norton (Jack). It's SO predictable that Jack is going to try to set Nick up, that I don't mind saying it here! Plus, Marlon Brando's part is more than secondary: in fact, you could almost do away with it altogether... Don't know: the more I think about the movie, the less stars I feel like giving it. At least I didn't pay [money] for two movie tickets!"
1,what are people buying this album for?,"ok, i'd bone her. but that doesn't mean i would ever want to hear her sing!"
1,works but at what cost,"I used half the recomended dosage for a month, had great workouts and then had a routine physical amd guess what. My Alt and Ast liver enzymes were over double what they should be. I do drink socially, however 2 months after I discontinued use of no xplode and kept everything else consistant my liver enzymes dropped back to the normal range. This stuff is very dangerous and should be removed from the market."
1,Run The Other Way!,"Lexmark's television adds state they 'help you to print less.' I have found this to be true because I can seldom get their product to print at all!My X85 worked OK for about the first year: there were some issues, but I could usually get it to print. One of Lexmark's suggested fixes for when I couldn't coax anything from my X85 was to unplug all the cables and let it sit overnight -- mixed results. Reliability has become more erratic with time. It may be that I have updated my operating system, and although I have downloaded new drivers that are supposed to work for my new OS from Lexmark's website, the software is very buggy. Also worth considering is the X85 really doesn't seem to like you to refill your own cartridges -- too bad because the cartridges are very expensive and it is a nasty waste of materials to throw these things away.Perhaps this product works OK in the Windows world -- I don't know. If you have a Mac you should run the other way -- fast!"
1,Senseless Drivel,"Even though the book is a rework of a previous work of his, I can only pray that he did not really write this piece of trash. This book was a complete waste of time. Thank god it read fast because of the short chapters.Patterson should stick to Alex Cross novels. I can't believe this book is still in the top fifteen of the New York Times bestseller list."
1,Horrid. Does not deserve its reputation,"Let me say first, I am an amateur painter. But I have been painting interiors and exteriors for a long time. Let me say second, the day I used this was humid and warm. But it was not outrageously so. My prep was sound: spackel where I need it, sand and clean with Dirtex.I used a good roller cover. I painted as I always have. The result: A primer that came off in patches. Disappointed to say the least."
1,A Huge Disappointment,"EA Sports really had a chance to knock our socks off with NBA Live 2001, but they gave us a real stinker. First off, the control is pretty bad, as you never feel that you have control of the players. The graphics are really pathetic, as the courts look really aliased and *cough* PSone like. The player models move with such rough animation that its hard to watch. The camera angles are also bad. Pass on this game ... hopefully EA can get it right next year."
1,More Adventurous Rilo Kiley,"Quite frankly, this album is not good... or even fair for that matter. It is extremely bland and tasteless. I am actually quite fond of this genre of music, if it is done right. This one just does not tip the iceberg, so to speak. It is boring, and the musical content does not sound like it was recorded by professional musicians. On this album, ""More Adventurous"" the music is as creative as a W2 form. I absolutly applaude any human being that claims to have an ear for good music that can find the courage and will power to subject their ear drums to such brutal and grotesque defilement. This album is certainly one for the brave."
1,Read it if you get your idea of police work from TV,"If you get your entire perception of police work from tv or the movies then this book is for you. If you believe that a police chief actually runs a criminal investigation then this is for you. If you think that the ""real police""...the ones who work the street, talk to nuts on the phone, work 18 hour days watching suspects, hide in bushes on stakeouts, actually are the ones that solve cases then this is one is not for you."
1,"overrated, Charleston hall is better","I have this album, it is decent but not great as these people say. Live at Charleston Hall is excellent and definately his best."
1,Ungodly book,"After watching and reading ""A Walk to Remember"" I was very interested in reading more of Sparks books.I'm very sorry to realize he is not the writer I was hoping to find. God's word is very clear about fornicationand how fornicator's will not enter into His rest. The ""Notebook"" also had this as part of the story. People make mistakes but it should be clear that there are consequenses for our sin."
1,Baby Signs,I agree this movie was not what I expecting it to be. I thought it would be more of the basics of sign Language. My baby does like watching it because of all the other babies. But it was not what I was look for in a baby sign videos. She shows no interest in learning these sign right now. And I would like to teach her the basics of sign language first before add these words from this video.
1,Abandon Ship!,"Hawke is billed to be a fast paced techno thriller (my favorite type of book), but it has a number of horrible flaws.The first is repetition. Crappy jokes used more than once and facts repeated over and over points to poor editing or a ghost writer working off a limited number of points.The second glaring problem is the main character's back ground. Hawke is in his 30's, yet he already attended Oxford, joined the Royal Navy, passed flight school, flew in combat, joined the SBS, did ""a tour"" with them, then had countless other adventures.Despite being a child prodigy and a military superman Hawke then becomes confused with terms like HUMINT and a HAHO parachute jump.The final scene of jets firing heat seeking air-to-air missiles pushed me over the edge, forcing a 1 star review.If you're going to write a militaristic techno thriller at least try to get your facts right!"
1,Rip Off,"I just bought this and a portable speaker system to use with my MP3 player. When i opened the box, they looked like pretty good headphones but when i tried to put them on, i realized that it wouldnt actually ""clip"" on. It had the clip, but, unlike other models that i have had before this one, it wouldnt click open and shut. I paid $10 for these. This is half the price of the Portable speaker system i got which was only 20. Hmmmmm....... Anyway, it did hav pretty good sound when i held the thing up to my ear, which is why i gave it a ""2"" star instead of a ""1"". Overall: DONT BUY IT!!!"
1,Are other people reviewing the same movie?,"I love sci-fi. This movie doesn't fit the bill. It was just truly awful. Cult classic? Try cheesey, poor story and boring. By the end I couldn't have cared less what happened. This movie is on par with your typical syfy original movie."
1,Poor Quality,"This is a real disappointment. Within one week of receiving the percolator, the glass on the top cracked rendering the pot useless. I expected much better quality from Coleman. Would NOT recommend."
1,this book is pathetically stupid.,"I just read all the reviews of this book... it has great writing, i agree, it's pretty interesting, okay, but five stars??? give me a break. This book is about the lamest excuse for a historical fiction novel i've ever seen. Right off the bat it's improbable. And ""WetSteel""? What the hell is that all about? Anyway, this book drove me completely bonkers because i've studied the ""titanic"" explicitly and any moron with half a brain knows that there is no 300 foot gash in the side of the sunken ocean liner. And, more obviously, that it would be completely impossible to ""raise the titanic"" because it's lying in two seperate pieces! Maybe other people can stand reading historical inaccuracies, but if you're like me, and seeing something incorrect bothers you, do NOT read this book...it'll make you want to scream with frustration from the very beginning."
1,Legend,I think there's really no rating for this book; it is to each one to choose.This book is what legends are made of! ...Maybe the author wanted to create a legend here.
1,Do not purchase,We purchased two of these batteries for two phones and both are terrible. Talk time is usually less than 20 minutes and the battery does not charge if the phone is still 'ON'. Look elsewhere for a replacement battery.
1,Too Small,"This bag was highly disappointing. It was too small, I think a make up kit might be bigger. It was actullay available in TJ Max for $12.99 minus the wallet so anyone can do the math and realise this is a bad deal."
1,What a disappointment!,"Sorry, I didn't like this book at all. Very few pictures and the recipes are nothing special. Many typos/ mixed instructions. I threw it away."
1,This movie was just awful,"I went to this film for the special effects. I find it amazing that before it was over I was actually tired of seeing them. Cities being destroyed actually got boring. I could pick apart the many problems in this film, but why bother. This film is bad, bad, bad, bad, bad."
1,Didn't work!,"I was extremely excited when I received this product and have had good success with Samsung products. However, when I made all the connections, the unit didn't work. I was disapointed and frustrated. All the connections and settings were correct, but it didn't work. I have an older DVI connection instead of the newer HDMI digital connection.I returned the product and bought the Humax brand HDTV tuner. I bought a DVI to HDMI cable and connected the unit. It works like a charm! I don't know what was wrong with the Samsung SIR-T451, but I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone. I'm also having second thoughts about Samsung products now. It seems like the reliability/quality factor of Samsung products has declined now that they are more mainstream."
1,eh...........,"I never, ever thought I'd say it...but Katie Holmes on screen about 98% of the time just didn't do enough to make this movie worth it. Decent premise, I suppose. Boyfriend missing, recovering alcoholic cop on the verge of a relapse. It just doesn't add up, and there's a supposed ""twist"" at the end can be guessed as soon as you learn the premise. Coulda been better."
1,Kidman's Hair Rules Screen,"I love cheesy science fiction. Mole people, giant insects, nuclear mutants, sure. I'm okay with remakes that are well done. But this remake of ""Invasion of the Bodysnatchers"" is terrible! Kidman's prescription-happy psychiatrist who is inexplicably linked to the high-powered Washington elite makes no sense, the child is pretty well annoying, and her emotions for the cardboard ""not-a-boyfriend"" boyfriend played by Daniel Craig are unclear through most of the film. Not to pick on Kidman specifically, since the other characters in the film were equally wooden, but her haircut made more of an impression on me than the plot. Really, given the quality of actors assembled for the cast, I have to wonder whether to blame the script or the director. Skip it and watch the original - some remakes should have stayed in the dream vault, and this is one of them."
1,Angel eyes for dogs,"I was not that impressed with this product. First, my dog did not like anything I put it on. So it was very hard for him to consume. Second, I think I could have seen if it worked better if it came in a pill form. he wouldn't eat it and therefore there wasn't much change."
1,Bacteria appear to be dead,"I did some searching on the net on how to test a probiotic. The test that everyone seems to recommend is that you put 4 oz of milk each into two containers and add two capsules of the probiotic to one of them. Then leave them out at room temperature. The milk with the probiotic should congeal into the consistency of yogurt after about 8 hours. My test showed no change in consistency after 15 hours, although the milk with the probiotic smelled like yogurt. The temperature during this time was about 61F."
1,meh,"its not my favorite really, but i would use this again. i do enjoy the way it smells and the hold is strong and soft but it made my hair frail and brittle"
1,bought this as a joke for my MIL,"My MIL Loves Kid Rock because of his new Sweet Home Alabama song. So I bought this, along with my BIL, as a gag gift for christmas so she could see what an awesome American he used to be."
1,RIP OFF INCOMPENTENT LABEL THIS IS COMPLETE GARBAGE,THIS WAS AN EMBARASSMENT TO THE LABEL...1ST OF ALL THE SONGS WERE OUT OF SEQUENCE AS SAID ON THE SET LIST...ENOUGH SAID...WHY SHOULD WE HAVE TO PUT UP WITH TOM WAITS HORRIBLE VOICE THEN HAVE TO DEAL WITH AN INCOMPENTENT LABEL WHO CAN'T EVEN DO SOMETHING SIMPLE LIKE LABEL THE SET LIST RIGHT...I WAS TOTALLY ANNOYED BY THIS...PLUS THE SONGS ARE JUST MULE VARIATIONS II...NOTHING NEW HERE...LOOKS LIKE WAITS IS HAVING TROUBLE COMING UP WITH SONGS...MAYBE THE MESS UP IN SEQUENCE WAS DONE ON PURPOSE SO THE LISTENER WON'T BOTHER READING THE SORRY LYRICS...THIS IS TRASH...GET FRANKIE'S WILD YEARS INSTEAD!!!!
1,This is a good movie,"This DVD provides no features or options. I found it to be very unprofessionally made. The quality of the film is horrible in most DVD players. They only one I could get the movie to play correctly in was a DVD Recorder. I recommend you purchase Horror Classics 50 Movie Pack Collection from Amazon. It contains The Screaming Skull and 49 other good horror films. For all 50 movies, it only costs $12.99!!!"
1,Mediocricity isn't a bad word,"Please, people. Jewel is no genius. She is part of a marketing scheme. Wake up and listen to real music... Hands is a cliche."
1,This Darned Elusive Happiness,"The content was very fast to read. Didn't care for the paper it was printed on. Made letters look fuzzy with the cotton content. Maybe I've read too many self-help books about relationships and life, but I was disappointed with this work. I have read the previous writings (highly recommend) and couldn't wait to read this book, but unfortunately, it didn't resemble previous works."
1,The Band is great!!.......,"But the voice, is very dissapointing. When the music begins, it sounds nice. Then, suddenly an ear-hurting voice begins to sing. The song lyrics are very nice. If another artist would have recorded it, It would be a better CD. But for now, don't waste your money!!!"
1,NOT AS ADVERTISED,"The material is black with a FLOWERY DESIGN. Picture is very misleading. They appear to be sturdy. Returned with no problem, except after 2 months STILL NO CREDIT."
1,I'd rather have a root canal...,"This could perhaps be the DUMBEST movie that I've ever seen. I didn't find one thing funng/entertaining/charming about the entire flick. The portrayal of both gay men and women was horribly stereotypical and pretty disgusting. In fact, I agree with the reviewer who wrote that it seems like the topless women were just thrown in to entice straight men to watch this horrible film. It's a shame that Cuba Gooding Jr. has his name on this one, because I think he (usually) has a tremendous amount of talent.Unless you like movies with no plots that make fun of gay men and show women as commodities, give this one a miss."
1,Driver nightmare,"No driver CD came in the box, so I went to the website which was badly broken. Google search got me to the driver download page, but it wouldn't install. After you get to the install screen, you have a Windows ME-looking splash screen with, two buttons: ""Multimedia Slim Keyboard"" or ""Exit."" Clicking the keyboard button causes nothing to happen. *sigh*Finally I was able to install it by launching one of the .exes within the zipped installer file- which worked, except for the repeating registry errors marching across the screen like dominoes. If you can hit Enter fast enough, the error will stop, and the kb works partially- standard keys are fine, but the extra mm keys do nothing . Needless to say, I'm returning this item.The hardware, however, is perfectly fine, relatively comfortable and the slim-ness is appealing enough. This might work OK for you if you're on XP."
1,would not suggest this book to a Patterson reader!,"this was the most disappointing book i've read by Patterson - can't blame Amazon, book was delivered in the time they said it would be"
1,Does more harm than good,"I am a Christian, and I certainly don't think you have to be an idiot to believe in the Bible and I think there are some wonderful sources in the world if you feel pressed to justify your beliefs on an intellectual level, BUT...this is not one of those sources. It is full of mistakes and misinformation. I hope it is accidental rather than deliberate, but I do have to warn you that using these arguments to justify the Christian faith will only feed the secular view that there is nothing intelligent about Christianity.He tells outright lies about Columbus that even a grade-schooler could catch (as another reviewer mentioned)...buy something by Chuck Missler instead...he's a little more esoteric, but a far better scientist and scholar (as well as a Bible believer)."
1,don't bother,"This book still exists? Save your money, its justmore corporate blah, blah, blah by three people who claim to have changed the face of corporate journalism by building an intranet that supposedly changed a company. Nothing more than a bunch of back-patting by three people who did nothing but spend 6-12 mo. in 'employee communications' positions within SGI working with an intranet that was conceived and built way before they took over.All three of them were escorted to the door because the company realized their ROI was zero. Too bad Markos, Drew and Kim...you couldn't get out of the way of your own 'spin.'"
1,Quit after a few pages...,"I have some experience with the NSA and cryptography. As soon as Brown's characters enter the NSA, it is apparent that Brown has no clue, has never been there, doesn't know the atmosphere or the people, that this book is pure schlock. You have to admire the guy for getting rich writing novels with stereotyped characters and grossly manipulated historical thesis. To think his stuff is being 'seriously' debated is amazing. The DaVinci Code is nonsense. This book is too. Too bad there isn't a rating for less than one star."
1,Pale print,"very very disappointed with this purchase, it looks so cheap and the print was so pale. there is depthness in the dimension of the picture scale. Not highly recommended."
1,"Reel Paradise should be renamed ""Real Torture""",I was so excited to see this movie. I envisioned Jon Pierson as a venturing Rick Steves type. Unfortunately even after a year in paradise he still had an edgy up-tight annoying personality. I would have hated to see him *before* he took this trip to paradise.
1,Manager should've yanked King from this game,"Thin plotting makes THE GIRL WHO LOVED TOM GORDON minimalist Stephen King, reasonably decent entertainment for a night but without the kind of imagination this writer normally displays. Coming off the far superior BAG OF BONES, it is a very slight effort indeed and, as it is actually only novella-length, it might have been wiser to save this story for the King anthology coming out later this year. The five-star raves for this rather ordinary book are typical of undiscriminating King readers; to suggest this book is as good as THE STAND or THE DARK TOWER series or even MISERY is simply ludicrous."
1,"Awful packaging, awful customer support.","I had the same problem reported by a couple of other reviewers. Indeed, it is nigh impossible to get the deodorant to push up out of the applicator. So, I called up their customer support line, and they were unwilling to offer an exchange or any tips for getting it working. Go with the malin+goetz eucalyptus deodorant. It's more expensive, but at least they are willing to help you with and stand behind their products."
1,Prelude to Corporate Excess,"The guts of VS were its operations. There is only one sentence in this book about the premier trainig operation in N.Lake Tahoe that turned out some of finest restaurant mgrs around.This book is about a small group of corporate people who partied, had random sex, drove nice cars, etc. The author seems upset that he didn't get a promotion - after reading this me-me book, I can see why. Towards the end, the author becomes a tattle-tale and somehow puts blame on one of VS's founders. It was tough to get through. Not very tasty."
1,"Good on paper, not in practice","In order for these well-thought-out, simple guidelines to work, you have to be involved in a professional atmosphere in which negotiation is possible. The guidance and counsel offered in this book simply will NOT work with, say, a micromanager hung up on getting things done HIS way or no way at all. I have loaned this book to several co-workers who have concluded the same.If your work place is open to professional input and ideas for improvement (even where office politics run rampant), the book might work. But if your work place is run by an aggressive, incurable micromanager (who continues to deny that he is one) your money might be better spent in, say, therapy."
1,Un-plesant to watch,"Let me say it at once: This is NOT a sensational opera DVD. It is NOT one of the very best - far from it. To wit: Patrizia Ciofi gives one the constant impression that she is wrestling (with her facial expression) in order to produce all of her singing notes, by the time it gets to the higher notes her face is so distorted, as if she is about to suffer a brain-struck. Her head is continuously tilted sideways and her face becomes asymmetrically - this is frightening to watch. A good singer she is indeed - but what's the gain here at the age of DVD and Blu-ray...? Awfully wrong.Ad to it the stupid staging that serves no purpose and you end with a DVD that you can do without. If you must have this opera take the other one, with Dassi."
1,The worst rubbish ever,"I reviewed this awful book when it first came out, and I am glad that it is out of print. I am not going to waste time repeating my lengthy original review. Let me just say that it was the worst rubbish ever. The author is a homosexual Marxist who thinks that homosexuality is not out of sync with Marxism, even though there is tons of evidence to the contrary. Worse yet, the author is, um, eccentric in many of his attitudes and opinions (I am being polite; I wasn't polite in my original review). Fernbach believes, for example, that communist revolutions have already taken place on other planets. Fernbach belongs to the category of people like Judy Grahn and Andrea Dworkin, in more ways than one. His theory that homosexuality can be somehow combined with communism to improve the human race is such a hoot. He himself is a living example of the failure of human evolution along such lines. I rated this piece of garbage with one star only because I could not rate it with none."
1,a masterpiece ruined by greed,"The only reasons Ozzy have not rerecorded Randy guitar is maybe because he and his wife don't have to pay him. Why don't rerecord even Ozzy voice, so he don't have to pay royalties to himself. From now I will think of Ozzy what he thinks of his fans. Unbelivable..."
1,Wrong Edition Shown,The picture shows the 7th edition and this book is the 6th. I was just about to purchase when I checked the description. Amazon should fix this.
1,Stripped gears - Power supply,"Must state this first: Mine is an ORCA3500 as opposed to the AG3500. Picture, dimensions, technical info, price range are the same for both therefore I assume they are identical. Gear problem is the same as other reviews.First shredder replaced under warranty, on 2nd one now. Both...stripped gears after approx 6 months light use. As designed, function switch doesn't disconnect the power line from the power supply circuit. Power supply always powered. Poor design. Line spike, or possibly just a diode failure, zapped 2 of the 4 diodes in bridge rectifier and blew fuse on ckt board. Replaced diodes and added separate fuse and switch right on power line input thus voiding warranty but so what...then the gears stripped again. 0 stars wasn't an option. Junk !"
1,Horrible shipping,Supposed to get by 13th. But got shipped by 24th. No communication or even courtsey to tell the reason. Site showed in stock.
1,Disappointed,"Product burned up the first time I plugged it in. The problem is, I didn't try using it for months after I bought it and therefore decided not to pursue returning for refund, etc.This is part of the inherent risk of online purchases for someone such as me."
1,"No Code-Behinds, No VS.NET, Almost Entirely in VB.NET","This is a good ASP.NET book for ""Notepad Developers"" who are migrating from VBScript to VB.NET or are learning VB.NET from scratch. There are some JScript and C# examples in the book but it is primarily VB.NET.I am using VS.NET which promotes ""code-behinds"" so this book is tougher to learn from for me. I like Wrox books but I will choose a different one (maybe from Wrox, Apress, or MSPress) to strengthen my skills with ASP.NET and VS.NET.You can count on solid content when Rob Howard is writing. Good web security stuff. I have been a fan of his since his Site Server P&M book (ISBN: 1861001940) hit the market."
1,Very slow-moving,"I am a very patient movie watcher. I let the credits linger and I panic if some body trys to talk to me right after a really great movie has ended, because how am I supposed to know what I think of it if I'm still soaking it in? Squirm has pretty much nothing to soak in. It's a talkie. It's all talk, really, and it is so slow-moving. It's just a terrible waste of time, and I waited for it to get better and it never did. By the end I couldn't get my self to watch the extra features on this disc, because I just really wasn't interested."
1,Can not listen,"I can not listen to the music on Amazon - called and told to use Mozilla or Firefox - still can't hear any music.The software goes through the motions, have checked volume on EVERYTHING and still no sound comes out with Media Player or Real Player."
1,Used?,This book was listed as Used - OK - but it was covered in blue ink and had been left in water. The pages were stuck together!
1,"Are You Listening, Universal? Not One Penny From Me","Don't you realize it yet? LISTEN... the people who buy DVD's of a TV show are FANS of that TV show. People who never watched Quantum Leap are not going to BUY Quantum Leap. The people who DO buy Quantum Leap expect the shows to be intact, just as broadcast. OTHERWISE YOU ARE RIPPING OFF THE FANS, THE PURCHASERS OF YOUR PRODUCT.My collection stopped at Season 1 and you won't get another penny from me if you continue to sell what you refer to as ""complete"" when it is in fact NOT."
1,Owner,"The box was very dirty. When I assembled I found some minor scratches at several locations on the glass. Even the delivery person was amazed, how dirty the box was.I should have returned this unit, but unfortunately it is a large item and would have cost me a lot."
1,Conservative propaganda unfit for publication,Give me a break. The ignorance of 50% of this country is startling (kinda) and sad (very).....
1,Cheapest make,"This sweater looks very cheap, it's way too thin and synthetic. I can't believe that anyone has given it more than 2 stars. A normal price for this kind of sweater should not be more than $10 (that's a max)."
1,Bad Experience with 2 Sony DVD Players,"I used to have a lot of respect for Sony. Thinking, because I own several Sony devices, they manufactured quality products. Well, the experience I have had with my CD/DVD 'DVP-NS5OP' and 'DVP-NS575P' freezing and not allowing me to watch my movies has caused me to totally change my mind. I keep getting an error 'Cannot play...' I have given up on Sony and will definitely purchase a different brand in the future."
1,Not even close to being as good as you heard,"Most people will probably hate me for writing this review about a classic, but I found Pride and Prejudice a terrible bore. Everyone knows what it's about, so I won't use up my time telling you. But the book is really sort of a nightmare that never ends. It is not romantic or charming in the least bit. The main character comes through as arrogant and at times even stupid. It is a completely forgetable book, and I have no clue as to why so many people find it romantic. The writing is good, it has it's moments, but it in no way makes up for this book's lack of everything else. Wuthering Heights and Little Women, other classics that are just about in the same genre, are by far superior. I was so disappointed I have not read another book by Austen, and I'm not planning on it."
1,One Of The Worst Films Ever Made,"I was a big fan of the first film in the series, but the sequels are so bad i can't even enjoy the first one anymore. This has to rank among the worst sequels of all time, right next to Jaws 2."
1,Did I miss something???,"I am amazed when searching through the recommended reads and find this book constantly on the lists. Our book club tried reading it and none of us could even get through it much less find anything worthwile to recommend it.Maybe because I didn't finish it there was something in the end that would have brought it all together for me???It just didn't hold my interest to get more than half way through and believe me, I tried.THUMBS DOWN to this one!!"
1,Sheer boredom,"Badly written, badly directed, well acted, well made. It cannot conceal the fact that it has absolutely nothing to say. It simply mills around for about an hour, and then decides to throw some graphic violence on the screen as a last-ditch effort for some kind of Artistic Significance. Avoid this film. It is utterly without any kind of value whatever."
1,"SHOULD HAVE BEEN CALLED 'OOPS, THE PRESSFIELD CAMPAIGN'","I WAS A PRESSFIELD FAN, BUT NOT AFTER THIS. LIMITED HISTORICAL VALUE, AND I MEAN REALLY LIMITED AS IN GREATER THAN ZERO, BUT LESS THAN ONE. POORLY CONCEIVED STORY, POORLY TOLD AND A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY.BUY THE TIDES OF WAR AND GATES OF FIRE AND THE VIRTUE OF WAR - THESE AT LEAST ARE ANCHORED IN SOME HISTORICAL FACT. THE AFGHAN CAMPAIGN IS THINLY FLOATED ON PRESSFIELD'S ""YOU ARE THERE"" IDEA AND JUST DOESN'T WORK.IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN ANCIENT HISTORY, GET THE REAL THING E.G. KAGAN OR HANSON. PRESSFIELD'S BOOKS ARE LIGHT YET IF CRAFTED PROPERLY CAN GENERATE INTEREST IN THE PERIOD OR THE CHARACTER. UNFORTUNATELY THIS LATEST BOOK DOESN'T AT THE MINIMUM ACHIEVE THIS LEVEL."
1,Not a good deal,"Ordered this deck as a gift. Never heard of Pyle before. Now I know why. This deck looks cheap with its tacky blue graphics. Right out of the box, the power switch didn't work. It has a one-year limited warranty, BUT you have to send it to the manufacturer at your expense, and send $20 for return shipping. Why would anyone spend $30+ on shipping for an item that arrived defective? It's going back to Amazon, and I'll buy a brand I recognize and trust."
1,Sprint Means US Only?!?!??!!,"I don't have this product yet but was very interested and ready to buy. Sadly, it's apparently stuck with Sprint and their EVDO (therefore CDMA) network, so it appears it will never work outside of the US. As an international commercial airline pilot, this product would be perfect! But with this poor choice of networks, it's apparently tetherd to the US only. Oh well, there goes many sales."
1,Highest temperature after 15 minutes 180 F,"The whole point is to boil water, to have HOT water-- but this only gets to 180 F maximum,so I returned mine"
1,Absolute Lies,"I can't believe the nerve of the authors, going after Kerry's service when Bush completely avoided Vietnam. At least Kerry VOLUNTARILY went."
1,Overblown Fan Letter,"Enormously imbalanced look at this possibly misunderstood historical figure. Ms. Fraser should know so much better than she appears to with her fawning approach and refusal to deeply examine the character of Marie Antoinette. It is hard to believe that historians up until now have so overlooked all of her seemly endless good qualities according to this author. So close to sainthood M.Antoinette appears, one would think Ms. Fraser had been commissioned by her heirs. Shame on you, Mrs. Pinter."
1,"if you like to reset, buy","I seldom have negative comments about products, but here we go. I bought this router when my older one died, and I wanted the fastest technology available. I am an experienced computer user (so please don't think I am just inept). I have owned this router for about a year now. I must say that set up was easy, and wireless as well as wired speed is okay. Not much better than other wireless routers I've owned (NetGear, D-Link, LinkSys). The main reason I am unhappy with this router is that it crashes very frequently. Usually at least once per day, and sometimes more. It has this bad habit of handing out mismatched addresses, thus no internet connectivity. The fix is unplugging everything and reseting, but it is annoying and a pain. I only occasionally had this problem with my other routers. For the price, this router is NOT worth it. I would not buy it again. I'd either stick with DLink or the LinkSys that seem more robust."
1,Broke almost immediately,I used this hard drive for two weeks before it suddenly stopped working with no warning. The drive stopped showing up on my computer when it was plugged in.
1,Not upto standard,I have played the Need for speed games both on Pc and on playstation and really enjoyed Need for speed 4.But NFS 5 wasnt as eays to control or as fun to play.Only Porshes being available was a drawback and the gameplay was boring.I would recomend F1 2oo1 or Nfs 4 high stakes.
1,Weakest of the series,The harry potter series is a very good lineage of movies. This one just happens to be the worst of them all
1,Mediocre Meco,"I've purchased this model grill three time before from regular retail stores and loved them. After first use of this one, I discovered the lid was dented so badly that the smoking function was lost. The front legs were so much shorter that grease from cooking all flowed out the front bottom. If I had discovered the damage before using, I might have bothered to try and re-pack and sent it back. Will get another, but not from Amazon."
1,Dumb,At first I thought the characters were a little funny and they are but the story is just dumb. Then I realized the characters are dumb. The plot is dumb and kind of gruesome. Uh uh. Waste of time.
1,Waste of time and money,"I got this book hoping for insight as to what made this legendary woman so fascinating. What I received was a book which repeated the same thing over and over (I get it, Jackie's dad was a womanizer who was known as Black Jack, and her mom was critical, can we move on now please?), written at what I can only assume is a (...)reading level, by a woman who did not know Jackie, but is attempting to profit from the fact that they once lived in the same building. The one star is for some nice pictures, but if that is what you are interested in, then I would suggest that you buy a picture book. It would be a much better use of your money."
1,Nothing but static,"Horrible monitor!!! All I could hear was static!!! I would NOT recommend this monitor to anyone. I had a Safety 1st monitor before and it was great. I don't know if they changed it within the last 2 years, but I was NOT happy with this one."
1,"Sadly, Siouxsie can't sing in tune anymore.","Let me first say that I am a MAJOR Siouxsie & The Banshees fan, and have been for many, many years. I didn't add this uncharacteristically awful album to my iTunes collection of the entire Siouxsie & the Banshees catalog, because the out-of-tune singing is unbearable. I can only wonder what Siouxsie herself thinks of this album. Maybe the monitors on stage were not supporting her the way she needed, but she very rarely comes close to hitting a note during the entire show. The band sounds a bit thin, with only Budgie turning in a performance that could be considered memorable. But the singing... ugh."
1,One was enough!,"I have to hand it to the author that he did his best in trying to market all of his books by using God's name in vain. He sure has guts! No one in their right mind would believe everything that is written in CWG. I believe that the author is just looking for a poor excuse to do anything he wants and get away with it in a very discreet way, which would hopefully be acceptable to society. Obviously not! And the sad part is he used God. I agree that this book should be considered as fiction...definitely fiction!"
1,"Not ""Mighty Bright""","I'm an adult taking music lessons and bought this based on recommendations here, and also because it's cordless, and I like to move my music stand around and practice in various locations, including out on the porch at night (in nice weather). I'm frankly very disappointed with the strangely faint blue light this casts on the sheet music. One or the other of the lights went out several times as I moved the heads around to illuminate dark spots on the sheet music. Then, after only 9-10 hours total use, it appears the batteries (the recommended high quality ones) have died. Strangely, my music teacher bought one after I did, and he told me he didn't like the light either. Based on reviews of other stand lights, I think I'm buying a cheap, goose-necked, plug-in clamp lamp for this purpose, and giving up on the high tech solutions."
1,it had a crack,"I ordered a white and a purple crystal, when I received my crystals, the white crystal was perfect, but the purple crystal had a crack. The hole in the purple crystal was also not drilled properly, and that area is partly chipped away, and I am not sure if this can be used.I don't think the damage/crack happened during transit because it was packed really well, and it looked more like manufacturing defect.I decided not to return the crystal because I don't want to waste time and money for shipping back something that I purchased for $3.50, but I am disappointed that the crystal was not checked before it was packed for shipment."
1,Great ideas - poor execution,"When everything is working, this is a great router system. Too bad, it seldom works. I've owned the router for over a year and for 6 months of that time it has been in and out of the shop. Problems include broken motor lock mechanism, broken worm gear to raise motor and broken shaft lock. Last time, I bought extra gears and shaft lock pins just to keep it out of the shop. Any sawdust clogs the mechanism so raising and lowering are tough. I've had several other PC routers and have been extremely pleased with all of them, but this one has just about made me lose the faith."
1,Most didn't glow,"This order was quite disappointing. I ordered these to surprise friends that I was going to a concert with, but well over half of these refused to glow. Wouldn't recommend anybody purchasing these."
1,3 times Junk,"This item gets 1 star only because I had to, it deserves a 0 star. Bought a 3.5mm Stereo Jack To 1/4"" Stereo Plug Adapter from LowerPriceUSA... product was defective (will not accept the 3.5 plug) and replaced by LowerPriceUSA with a second defective product. If I have #2 replaced, will #3 be any different then #1 and #2?... most likely not. Save your money."
1,beware of seller,"I had to send back 2 Irons, both were suppose to be new! The first one the plate was scratched and the 2nd one had all kinds of stuff come out when you used the steam, staining the clothes!I ended up buying one locally at Macy's for the same price!"
1,i like the old game boy better,if you ask me i like gbc the best cause gameboy was made to be a simple system witch the recent ones arent....but anyways my bro had one and the screen fell off IN A WEEK OF USE...HE TOOK GOOD CARE OF IT TO!....just get a gba non sp....how ever the lighted screen is a nice addtion....but i snake light for gba does the same thing....gba was and still is the best handheld....besides n-gage witch is 300$.
1,Worst season of all,"This was and is the worst season out of all except for Rose, she is what made the shows. Alan was just plain stupid, Charlie was an idiot, and Jake, he is too old for his part as a B.A. teenager. I would't waste my money for this season as it is not worth a cent."
1,Waste of Money,Received this as a gift and the animals were so small it became a choking hazard. I wound up not even letting my six month old play with the toy and eventually threw it away when my eldest lost all the animals. Now that I see how expensive the toys was.
1,fair,"Its ok for some things, but I haven't had a chance to use it enough yet to give a great review."
1,Tight fit,M-D Building Products 92924 48-Inch Soft Carrying CaseThe level fits into the case with no room to spare. so tight that I think the zipper will eventually split.
1,Generic textbook.,"If performing any type of self taught work, expect to use this title for a paper weight. Without prior experience, I found the book to be difficult to follow and the practice examples poor. The book also seemed very far out of date."
1,Couldn't hook it up,"I tried it on two television sets and tried all recommended available hookups--and I have been doing this kind of connection since the 1970s. But I couldn't get the setup to start. When I finally located the producer in Taiwan,whose only advice was to get another one from the seller, who said they weren't producing it any longer. End of story. But I had read a review which concluded that it was the best in its price category."
1,Above Artists,"If you enjoyed Roger Black telling you how to design for the web, you're going to love this. You're probably also a beaten house-wife.I have witnessed over and over again, the deep heated desire to control creatives. I believe it largely stems from envy. This guy probably had a problem with sound in movies, color television and graphics on web pages.If you want to really learn something about useability, try Edward Tufte.Nice cover design though. I suspect he objected to that as well."
1,Don't bother,"I read this book a few years ago as part of my Master's degree program in American History. It's the most impenetrable gobbledygook I've ever read; a great example of how too much history is being written for other PhDs, though I doubt if any PhD other than Wilentz understands it. Don't waste your time unless you need further proof that Wilentz in more interested in political grandstanding than writing good history."
1,Sour and mope.,"If the role of the 'gringo' portrayed by Matthew Perry is typical of the U.S. male, apologizes to U.S. female. This young actor seems as ""Forest Gum"" in all his scenes. Even his mouth is open as a fool every time someone speaks to him. Nevertheless, Salma is fabulous as the Mexican girl. She acts naturally and with convincing dialogues. This could be better with another young actor; even a beginner could make a good role. This could be better with another young actor; even a beginner could make a good role. Some questions arrive. How a mature girl can be so immature (or immoral) to be pregnant with a guy she meets after hours. Is this the practice in Latin girls? Where are the anticonceptives? How does she protect from HIV, STD, and other diseases? This film is a bad example for the youngsters. I do not find it any positive in terms of culture clashes it pretends to portrait neither."
1,I was Lucky - I got my Money Back,"I think this is the worst PS2 Game out there. When I returned it to the store (Wal-Mart) they said NO returns after the package was opened but when I told them how BAB it was they understood and said I could have any other PS2 game of my choice. Surfing H3O is very hard to play, graphics suck. there is a lot better games to spend your money on. I wouldn't play this game if it was FREE."
1,bosch reconditioned saw,"the blade guide assembly was defective, the saw did not work---I had to purchase a new blade guide assembly from bosch for 9.00. If this does not work then the saw is worthless Thanks bscdray1@verizon.net"
1,A collection of papers at best,I am a graduate student of solid mechanics and I have read quite a few books on FEA. Of all the textbooks I have read-this is clearly the worst. The authors don't spend any time to make the material coherent and organized. They seem to have published this book just for the sake of establishing their names in the field. It is basically a collection of research papers on the subject. The worst part of the book is that the authors use excessive verbiage to describe extremely inportant concepts with little or no mathematics. This leaves the readers confused and disoriented. This book is not for those looking for an introductory text and is useless to even those experienced in the field. Avoid this book.
1,Caution run amuck,"This book is an odd blend of good massage information and extreme paranoia about ""dangerous"" massage techniques. There are indeed techniques that are not appropriate in pregnancy, but this text makes it sound as though ordinary thumb friction strokes will cause miscarriages. There are better books on the market that explain the necessary precautions without encouraging such a fearful attitude."
1,you know what,I wouldent have made a 1 star review of this album but i am angry tired and had a bad day today so im giving it one star becuz its awful and shes stupid and i hate her.
1,Nice mark up,Get them direct from north face for $22. Not sure why this camping store thinks they can charge more than twice the price for the exact same stakes!
1,Snooze,I tried so hard to LIKE this book but I just couldn't. It was boring and slow and took me a month to finish it bc I hate not finishing a book I started. I feel like her life was not that fascinating to be publishing a book about it. Ugh.
1,got refund,"book was in very bad condition for the money.got a partial refund from amazon because i still wanted to get the book but was too embarrassed to give as a gift,so just gave before Christmas,big rip-off from that company i think..had a 99 cent sticker plastered on the front,and an inscription to someone in the front cover.ugh.never again."
1,Don't waste your time reading this,"After getting into this book I quickly realized that Webber really doesn't have his own style or persona. He has adopted his style from WEB Griffin and Vince Flynn. The only difference here is the ""one up man ship"" in the story line and plot. I saw many of the same ideas in Flynn's novels but toned down and more realistic. Webber creates the ULTIMATE DISASTERS on just about every page and quite frankly it got to be a little over the top.From Griffin's genre he has given his hero's enough money to be able to any thing they want. However, I find it absolutely unbelievable that they could destroy so much of their equipment and walk away each time. He makes the CIA look like inept amateurs when the continuously miss their prime target over and over.If someone were to ask me, if they should read this book; I'd most likely tell them no. BUt if they insisted, I'd give tem my copy just to get it off my shelf."
1,A major disappointment,"As a huge fan of ""Pieces of You"" I was really let down by Spirit. The music is not all that bad but the lyrics are insipid to the point of naseau. There are a couple of redeeming tracks (my favorite is ""I've been down"") so it rates more than just a single star."
1,It sucked.,"If you have to read this book, borrow it from a friend or wait until it is in papperback, don't waste any more money than you have to. Clancy has become lazy or has a poor ghost writer. Perhaps it's a lazy, poor ghost writer. Either way, the book is a let down full of repetition, dogma, and typoes."
1,"Poor voice, little talent","It is evident that the singer in this cd, Russell Watson, is a singer with a poor voice and little natural talent.Not only is his interpretations stylistically incorrect, he also has to simplify the music to suit his limited vocal abilities.The voice itself is of unremarkable quality, and it also sounds reedy in medium range and strident at the top.Coupled with a faulty technique, the singing is, to be honest, rather unpleasant for most of the duration of this cd.While this cd may satisfy some, musically it is a virtual disaster."
1,"Bad writing, shame.","I was really excited about this book Right up my alley. But the writing was so flat, borderline unintelligible, that I couldn't slog through the first 25 pages. Wish he'd had a ghost writer, because it sounded like it could have been an interesting story."
1,junk,"i new that is was a gamble for the low cost but thought that i would give it a shot....first thing i opened the case and one was REALLY bent, got caught when the case was closed at the factory. then i noticed some of the other tips were dulled from rubbing on the inside of the case. still i tried a few others...couldn't get a clean hole even with a drill press...sad really they are just useless...would give it 0 stars"
1,Not as Advertised,"This product shipped to me as the TRU9465, which is a single handset system. I tried to look up the TRU9460-2 on Uniden's website and there is no such phone system. Additionally, the TRU9460 itself does not come with the answering maching system as shown in the pictures Amazon.com has provided.The TRU9460 is a single phone system with no answering maching or extra handset and charger at all. Do not buy this product because it is falsely advertised."
1,The American Prophecies : Ancient Scriptures Reveal Our Nati,"If I could rate it lower then 1 star, I would. This is so twisted, I pray Americans, who founded this country on the ""Word of GOD"" and Freedom, have enough brains to figure out what this book actally is. IF Americans, continue to be so ""Mindless"" they will be like sheep led to a slaughter. OPEN your BIBLES AMERICA! Read the TRUTH. The Bible MEANS what it says, and says what it means. If America dosen't understand the Truth of it, it's because they DON'T open it! Takeing the Bible out of the schools was a Major step in the ""Rape"" of America. Wake up people, or one day not far away...You'll have No Choices, all because you don't look for the truth yourself. Look up, Seek God, find the truth. Truth is the personal Relationship YOU have with JESUS CHRIST!"
1,Boring and depressing,It's a depressing movie about a mental illness that makes one desire to commit suicide. I found nothing inspirational about the movie because the characters did nothing to change their situation.The movie attempts to philosophize about life and happiness. Noone should take that seriously because it's coming from a mentally ill person. The message is don't cherish life and it took all of two hours to deliver it.
1,Truth is the first Victim,"The book is quick on conclusions. It avoids any analysis of archeological finds that do not accord with such conclusions. The fact of the matter is that much evidence support the 'traditional' story of Islam, in particular in the Fertile Crescent where archeological finds have not contradicted the 'traditional' story.The fact that no such digs where ever conducted in the birthplace of the entire movement is regrettable. Incidently, Mecca should prove a veritabley exciting site, given the fact that it had been on a trade route for probably hundred of years before Mohammed's time.The search for answers to these questions, without theological or (much worse) political motives seems hard to expect in the present time. As usual, ""Truth is the first victim"" of the current tragic events."
1,"Adequate, but barely.","Although this book was entertaining, it is hardly the best book out there for tales of 'cyclers. I did enjoy the tale of the poor girl who got [...] on a Panhead that was trash. And the story about the guy who picked up a ghost was entertaining, even if it was hardly believable. Many of the stories were just too short and seemed to have no point. I point here in example the story about the kid who saw a bunch of 'cyclers going to a funeral. Big whoop. Keeping to stories of adventure would have been better, but many of these stories do't even fit the subtitle ""Hell-Raising"". Blaah."
1,what a pity works like this are now so accessible,"i understand that in one way this is a genuine rant against a religion rather than a race. but it reads badly and to all those plonkers who positively review it, they abuse it to serve their own ends. so its a pity they can by being able to access it at all. take it down and all the other hate."
1,Difficult to Reconcile with other Historical Writings,"This book is very difficult to reconcile with other historical works. After all, the relevant time period is only a few hundred years ago when, believe it or not, people were able to write! As a result, there are many, many, documents which conflict with the author's conclusions. For an enjoyable opposing view, I suggest one read Undaunted Courage by Ambrose who describes the use of firearms during the Lewis and Clark expedition. Or consider the writings of Jefferson, Hamilton, and other historical figures as another source.My overall impression is that the author's methods need to be questioned. There is too much conflicting information that we know to be accurate to declare this book a credible work. Who should we believe - Bellesiles or Thomas Jefferson and Meriwhether Lewis? My suggestion is don't bother to buy this book unless you enjoy the irritation of someone trying to prove to you the earth is square based upon esoteric records."
1,What do you expect from a westerner?,"Sandra Mackey in this book puts together half facts, accusations and fiction together and present them as a work of research. She claims, for instance, that lack of female figures in remains of Persepolis proves that Cysrus invented veil for women and was the orignator of femal subordniation which was later picked up by other cultures. I would not expect anything different from a self-serving, westerner with depp roots in judeo-christianity who would naturally seek to place blame for the backward implements that her heritage was responsible for."
1,Save Your Money,"I couldn't get past the first 20 pages it was so boring.I must admit I didn't even finish reading the book and that's a first for me. I may even skip 20 or 30 pages at a time, but I generally finish a book. Not this one, it wasn't worth it. I really used to like Sandra Brown's books, but The Alibi was the last one worth reading."
1,So-So,"I couldn't get into this as an adventure story. Somehow it was a weak combo of environmentalism and philosophy. It won't go in my library, but to the give away stack."
1,"The series gets pointlessly longer, unfortunately.","Ender's Game is fantastic. Speaker for the Dead is possibly the best SF book ever written. Xenocide continues the series, but it just coasts along without any of the punch of the first two book. Much happens, the plot moves forward, but in retrospect I wish I had stopped with book two. This book was too plot heavy and too predictable."
1,Don't buy!,This sheds! I bought two sizes. One for a 80lb. dog and one for a 10lb. dog. They're both terrible! I have large pieces of white fuzz all over my house.
1,Really not worth it.,"This is literally something that you can do around the house. It comes with cooking oil, glitter and special fizzy tablets (read Easter Egg die tablets mixed with vinegar). It has enough for three experiments and even those don't work, plus the test tubes leak getting cooking oil all over. Save your money and do it at home yourself."
1,"fits just like the picture, not very good if youre skinny","not a good fit. The sleeves are too large and it looks like medical scrubs. If you are skinny, you may want to avoid this shirt."
1,rip off,"there is absolutely nothing ""magnetic"" about these. they are plain plastic rollers with small plain metal clips. conair has something similar and there is a reason that ""con"" is in the name."
1,I don't agree,"I can't believe the other reviewers liked this book. I thought it was drivel. Ok, it was mildly entertaining if you could overlook the inconsistancies in time, geography, and stupid stereotypes about the people in the book. (not to mention the glaring lack of depth of characters and plot) But my main complaint about the book is, (I live in Oklahoma) that at the very least, the author could have picked up an Oklahoma map to make sure the characters were on the right highway to their destinations. If this is a ""true story"" use real towns and highways, if it is fiction, don't try to pass it off as true.It is very unbelievable."
1,Like a bad date,"Attractive and expensive, but did not dispense. It was sent away with dispatch. The product was defective out of the box."
1,God Almighty how can it get any worse!,"ONCE AGAIN, AMAZON IS CUTTING REVIEWS IN HALF. THIS REVIEW IS A CONTINUATION OF THE ONE DIRECTLY BLEOW. Ben paused, then eventually said, ""Okay, there are four types."" Suddenly, Ober walked in the door. ""I'm home! Is the lesbo here yet?"" ""Actually, there are five types,"" Ben said.It just does not get any worse than this. Baldacci's work is Shakespeare compared to this embarrassing trash."
1,Blasphemy!,"To abridge Grant's Memoirs is to eviscerate one of the greatest books in the English language. It's like cutting out various chapters in the Bible, or cutting act three from MacBeth. Please don't buy this abridged version, every word of the original is worth reading and savoring. Abridging this classic of American literature is incomprehensible and baffling."
1,"like getting hit by a sledgehammer, repeatedly","Reading C&P is like getting hit on the head with a sledgehammer, repeatedly. The author has a point to make; he makes it. Then, just in case you didn't get it, he makes it again. And again. And again. There, now did you get it? The entire book could be condensed into a short story and still effectively convey the same message. And on a more minor note, shouldn't *something* happy happen at least once in a novel? Shouldn't there be at least one scene in which a little birdie chirps a happy song from a pretty tree? Does *everyone* have to be spitting up their lungs into the gutter on a dark and gloomy day? Sheesh!!"
1,Very shoddy construction,"I just purchased the stroller today. I put my 3 year old in it for a test run and strapped him in. Something caught his eye and he sat forward, and completely ripped the straps of the 5 point harness clear off the back of the stroller. My kid is not large, nor is he exceptionally strong. All he did was lean forward, and that caused the straps to rip. Shoddiest construction I've ever seen. My cheap $50 stroller has held up far better over the years. The damage is fixable... but now I have to sew the straps back on. That's not something you should have to do to a $350+ stroller before you even get it out of the driveway. Very disappointed."
1,Lifesaver while it lasted,"Greatest invention ever! It helps me and my husband especially to stay on track with feeding and diaper changes! Great buy!!!!Unfortunately after not even 4 weeks the device started to have issues. First one button stopped working and then one after another to the point where the device was no longer functional and programmable . We changed the batteries twice, but nothing helped! So it was great while it lasted! I now just use the timer on my phone. TIP: If you have an iPhone just download a free app which works just as well and seems to be more convenient!"
1,Tell It All,"This is an important subject but the author does not do the hard work of putting all of the information together in a coherent form. The chapters ramble from topic to topic and the book contains anecdotal stories that do not support the main points well. Also, the author uses analogies that are meant to be witty but instead detract from the point. The author is very knowledgeable and does a good job of explaining open source software (2 stars), but in my opinion fails to explain the book's subtitle. There's little real info about how Linux & open source are undercutting Microsoft, Sun etc. That analysis should be the author's next book."
1,disappointing,I am a teacher and have absolutely loved all of the other books. I was very disappointed with this one. I felt that too many questions were left blatantly unanswered. This author doesn't need a ploy like this to get us to read her books!Why would a great wizard like Dumbledore blindly trust someone like Snape? The readers deserve to know the answer to that question at least. It was very unsatisfying to me. I'm sure I am well in the minority. I just expected more of her.
1,WAY TOO LONG!,"For every decent sentence in this book, there are another 20 sentences that could easily have been cut from the manuscript altogether. That is the biggest problem with this book...it is way too long. WAY TOO LONG!!! In fact, I am having a hard time remembering another book that is as guilty of being this unnecessarily long. This novel was originally self-published, and what I read is the alleged ""edited"" version. I have no idea what types of things the author's editor was doing all the time he or she was working on this book, but editing was certainly not among them. It's a shame, because there are definitely some good things about this book, and it would be a great and interesting story...if it was approximately 300 pages shorter. That's all."
1,"An Awful Attempt To Cash In The Sucsess Of ""Star Wars""",Dull and slow moving action and i do mean SLOW! as it can get.No doubt in my mind Clint Eastwood thought it would be a good idea to direct and star in an rather unstructred story concering a former Army Pilot still suffering from the horrors of vietnamis pressed back into action by the goverment to go into the U.S.S.R And steel a highly sophistcated jet the americans belivewill be used against them. It's obvious eastwood liked what hesaw in Star Wars and thought he could a blend of Sci-Fi-James Bond in 2 hours with Eastwood looking like a total fool in array of disguises. It was a real dissapoinment To see a true actinglegend succumb to his own shamefull descions. The real problemwith the film is that it was way overlong and streching theviewer's crediabilty for far too long to be actually enjoyed.
1,This is how it ends?,"I have read all of Anne's vampire books and have, for the most part, loved each one in it's own right. This, however, is such a departure in writing style, story-line and intensity, that I am shocked it was written by the same woman who brought us timeless stories of other vampires. Lestat seems to be written like an 18 year old surfer, using the word ""dude"" too many times for me to count. Mona is detached and cold. Quinn is a stumbling fool. This book lacks Lestat's charm, it also lacks Louis, Marius, Armand, Pandora and every other entertaing character she has previously brought to life. I am sad this is her last chronicle. I am more sad that this is how the chronicle ended, which such a disappointing book."
1,"Like sands through the hourglass, so are the Days of Our Lives.","In 1923 Cecil B. DeMille filmed ""The Ten Commandments"" at Nipomo Dunes in California. There he buried the film set after making the picture.This film has a Hallmark feel to it and does not take too much time to make CGI look real.With all the negatives it is still fun to pass the time with if you like all the sci-fi quickie movies where evil pops up mostly in desert scenes."
1,"good watch, bad chest strap","I just want to echo the prior reviewers comments about the chest strap not holding up, mine broke after 6 months. If that problem can be fixed, then great product."
1,DICK AND JANE,"I purchased this book because I am interested in starting my own Freight Brokerage Business. In order to start your own brokerage company you ""must"" already know how to broker freight. What I am looking for is detailed information about where to start and everything that is needed to startup. This book just gives a ""very simple"" explanation about how you broker freight. This was a total waste of my money!!!! I have been in the trucking business for 21 yrs and have brokered freight for about 8 years so I already know in general what needs to be done. I need a book that is much much more informative about HOW TO START A FREIGHT BROKERAGE!!!"
1,Defective Products,I purchased a bottle of Polo from Amazon that was shipped from the seller fromemeraldgreen1966. The first bottle has a defective sprayer. They replaced it with a new bottle that also had a defective sprayer. I believe this company is selling defective products as new and would never buy from them again.
1,Great Book No serial number for online part,"I bought this book from Amazon recently, they have been great about getting it resolved but from what we can tell after having replaced twice the serial number that they mention on the book is not included in any of the books Amazon has in stock."
1,Not impressed,"I was given this program as a gift, as I had been using the Hallmark Card Studio Deluxe 3 program for quite a while and thought it would be nice to have another selection of cards to choose from. The selection of pre-printed cards in this program is extremely limited compared to Hallmark (i.e., one choice for parents anniversary, only 2-4 birthday cards each for brother, father, mother, husband, etc.) And the ""humorous"" cards are pretty lame. I have yet to make a card from this program and always end up going back to Hallmark to find what I need. I don't recommend AG if you're looking for a wide-range of choices in cards."
1,Filter replacements no longer available,"We love our True Air, but you can no longer buy the filter replacements! Do not buy this model, they offer a newer version."
1,Terrible return policy for damaged item!,"I purchased two of these blades after searching for flat grind ripping blades. Upon receiving them I checked them over and found that one blade had a chipped tooth. The shipping package had no damage to it and the blades were well wrapped, so I could only conclude that the chip was missed by factory inspectors. I contacted Magnate and was given a RMA number. I figured they would also credit me for the cost to ship the item back. Wrong! They don't refund returning shipping charges! I don't think it's fair that I have to shell out more money to ship the damaged item back. This was their screw up. Needless to say, I won't be doing business with them anymore, and I will be a lot more careful with which companies (selling through Amazon) that I buy products from."
1,Where is the heart?,This video is about memorizing the steps. It does not really teach you how to dance the tango. And what's with the title of this video? Very confusing.
1,Just OK,"I purchased these to watch TV as my infant likes to nap on the weekends in her swing in the living room. They worked OK for my use, but they would cut out occasionally. Also, one ear was fuzzy, but that could have been my unit. I returned these and purchased some re-manufactured Sennheiser 900 mhz headphones for about the same price. Those work great all the time and I even tested them out into my back yard."
1,review,I do not recommend this coffee mug for drinking hot beverages. Cup gets too hot to handle or hold. This purchase was a complete waste of money for a coffee mug.
1,Let Their Be Light,"We wanted an inexpensive reading lamp that would sit quietly next to a living room chair without fuss or muss. The lamp was fairly easy to assemble. I did not appreciate the sticky label that was attached to the top of the little circular table because the glue left a sticky residue that I have not been able to remove with ordinary cleaners. Aside from that problem, the lamp works."
1,Slippery yoga mat,"My entire yoga mat has a greasy film to it (both sides) that has't come off. It is a very light film, but it is still enough that my hands/feet slide a bit (especially noticeable when in down-dog). Have never had this issue with other mats I own, which have all been different brands; so, I don't (and will never) know if it is a fluke as I will not purchase their mats again."
1,not good for beginners,"I found the text to be very unclear for inexperienved mechanics. The instructions say things like ""remove the middle and outer cowlings"" without explaining what the cowlings are. The picture associated with the instruction step then just shows a picture of the motor without identifying the part in question.There is some good information about how a 2-stroke motor works and basic concepts behind prop selection."
1,James Feuling hates surfers,"Mr. Feuling was arrested for destruction of property, namely the windsheilds of cars in the parking lot at Rincon Point. I caught him breaking the windows of cars in 1989 at Rincon Point where he lived. He was arrested are charged with the crime, he plead no contest in court and paid restotution and damages. He also poisoned trees and animals (neighbors pets) in the Rincon Point private community. He is the author of this book and should be ashamed of what he did back then."
1,"Encourages bullimia, anorexia and low self-esteem!","Just look at the titles on the magazines from the snapshots -- ALL of them concerned with 'losing weight', 'shedding a size', etc. This is an example of our patriarchal-controlled societies' influence on the control of women. I find it sad, and depressing that women actually buy magazines like this that covertly tell them they are worthless unless they are almost invisibly thin and star-like attractive according to some impossible-to-attain standard. Please, please don't buy this magazine and contribute to the perpetuation of this industry!"
1,NOT AS GOOD ANYMORE,"Kensington Expert Mouse used to be A-1. Not any longer. It has four buttons, a ball and a scroll wheel. Only 2 buttons are programmable so 2 are just duplicates or non-functionable. It has excellent pointer speed, but nothing between very fast and almost stop. Most important is that it is so sensitive, the slightest touch can lose what you're doing or working on. THIS IS VERY BAD! It seems there is no calibration made on this mouse--just slap four buttons around a ball and sell it to long time users. If I hadn't thrown out my older one, I'd return this one.I need a good mouse because of manual problems--this is not it, even though Kensington advertises it's ergonomic qualities. Because of these deficiencies price is too high. Would NOT recommend it."
1,Hideous typography,"The oh-so-topical references quickly date the book. More intrusive for me was the horrible Kindle formatting, which jammed subsections of chapters together with no typographical hint that the scene was changing; it was as if the original had spaces and lead-in sentences in some font or color that has somehow been omitted from the Kindle edition."
1,Eureka Vacuum Cleaner,"Too cumbersome, too heavy, takes a lot of effort to pull back on carpet, too many gadgets and dials."
1,Aweful- don't buy,"this literally broke after a half hour. This is garbage. The construction wasn't at all good. After a half hour, it literally melted and fell apart. I think this is actually a dangerous product and would NOT recommend."
1,Not worth it,"I bought this CD hoping that the songs I liked from the movie were on it. Low and behold, there aren't any songs on her that played in the movie, but in the credits.Don't bother buying this.. it'd be cheaper to just get the songs you liked from iTunes."
1,"Wow, I thought Hee Haw was as bad as TV could get....","Narcissistic characters, forced ""wacky"" humor, and an irritating soundtrack. Worse than Hee Haw and almost as bad as Grey's Anatomy."
1,Big disappointment!,"This fan's high setting pulls less air than the low setting on the Holmes 7 Twin Window Fan, HAWF2021-U. I have two of the Holmes because they really cool the rooms down at night. However, I wanted a fan with a remote for the bedroom so that I could turn it off without having to get up. (I've got 3 dogs and 2 cats who follow my every move, so getting up isn't that easy.) With the exception of a $12 fan from K-Mart, the Bionaire is the ""wimpy-est"" fan I've got! You might try another fan if you need one with a remote; try the Holmes if you don't (it's also less than half the price of the Bionaire.) BTW, the remote does NOT come with AAA batteries, despite what the description says."
1,fake,"The basket I received is fake, definitely not Frieling. It was sent from China and not the same size as described, poor quality with a strong odor. Should known better, the price is too good to be true. Be careful who you buy it from, Amazon should ban this seller (yux...)."
1,The worst piece of crap ever along with the Verizon customer service,"I've had my this phone swapped 3 times. 2 of which were in the last 2 weeks. Verizon didn't want to replace the load of crap. The calls drop, the phone comes on and off at will, the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently. This is just awful. Save your self a headache get a motorolla."
1,Don't buy this book!,"I hated this book. I am a fan of Rice's Mayfair Witches series and enjoyed the early works in the Vampire Chronicles, but Rice's later works are long drawn-out snores. The only one of Rice's books that was more likely to induce catatonia was The Violin. I also didn't see the point of having Merrick related to the Mayfairs since the only thing they have in common is being witches. Using dreams of Oncle Julien as a plot device was a cheat and the story would have been better if the Mayfairs had been left out of it altogether. As for Louis and his melodrama, by the middle of the book, I was more than willing to help him commit suicide if for no other reason than I was tired of his incessent whining.As for my recommendation: if you enjoy tedious whining from someone who chose to live forever, are a masochist, or are an insomniac needing a sleep remedy, then this is the book for you. I, on the other hand, would rather slit my own wrist than read another book by Rice."
1,A personal story of D-Day,"This video is not the Hollywood movie nor does it have anything to do with it. What it is is a documentary about a British soldier, Pvt Ryan. He was at the D-Day landings and simply recounts his experience. Overall his experiences are not all that exciting or even very interesting or inciteful. There is some historic footage that is mildly interesting. Overall this is not a video you will find yourself wanting to watch more than once or twice."
1,New version is not so nice.,I always buy this stuff for cleaning the interior of my car. I saw the listing on Amazon and decided to order from here since I had a gift card. When I received the product I noticed the bottle was different and definitely not the same quality of the old bottle. Instead of the nice mist that the old design gave this one does the mist plus the big drops of spray that most cheap spray bottles give. Also the new formula has the same basic smell but it is a lot stronger and definitely more of a chemical smell in a bad way. I do not like this new formula!
1,Read only if you have to read everything by Jude D,"I give this book two stars for being written by Ms. Deveraux and having a Montgomery in it, otherwise I wouldn't have wasted my time. It is a far cry from her usual style, almost science-fiction/mystery NOT good romance. The storyline goes way over the top and there is no character exploration. I never really felt like I knew any of the players. I do not intend to read any of the sequels."
1,The trick to enjoying this movie is to..,"watch it with kids under the age of 13. But even the kids will tell you it's the worst movie they've ever seen.You know, I like Chris Elliot too and I thought ""Get a Life"" was pure comic genius before the network started tinkering with the recipe. But this thing (insert head shake thingy) is so monumentally bad I'm actually at a loss for words. The blue chick with 6 arms and her giant husband that just opened a ""housewares"" store on a remote deserted island was pretty creative. OK, seeing Chris Elliot riding on the back of his girlfriend swimming across the Pacific with a ski rope to hold on to was pretty funny but that was about it.Now, if you find yourself all that curious about this flick the DVD transfer is pretty good and the sound is about what you would expect...but who cares? 2 wigs"
1,"Nice title, but not so good content","I began reading the book with a lot of spectation, but after the 4th or 5th chapter I was bored. It's about life of people that decided to change their lifes but it's just too superficial.I left the book, and just when I don't have anything else to read I open it again and read one more life.I hope there are better books to help us decide a change of life style."
1,BPA toy,"This toy didn't say BPA free on the packaging so I called fisher price to confirm and the customer service rep read off some standard reply that bpa is usually only present in higher levels in clear plastic toys - this toy clearly has a clear plastic topper. I told the rep that and he read another paragraph about how they follow the safety standards and blah blah blah there were only ""trace"" amounts and that it is only a problem in food or drink containers. What a stupid answer - what do small babies do with toys.... Put them in their mouths!! Educate yourselves parents! BPA is dangerous and should be banned in all baby toys. I bought the wooden Melissa and Doug stacker - safer and serves the same purpose. I'm not buying FP/Mattel toys anymore and I'm getting rid of the ones I already have."
1,It only looks good,For the price of this toaster one can almost buy four of other brands which probably works a lot better. It weighs a ton and toasts unevenly. Toast takes a long time to brown. I would have never bought this toaster except that it was a gift. I have the red one and I guess it looks good in the kitchen. My sister-in-law said that one is paying for the novelty of the blue light that comes on when it is turned on and the buzzer that sounds when the toast is supposedly ready. Definitely not worth the price.
1,You call this a novel??,"I love this series and own each book in it, so naturally I purchased the book with high hopes. I was *very* disappointed at the brevity of the story, how incomplete it was, and the overwhelming sense of the author rushing to get out a story by her deadline and to plug her next hardback novel. Shame on you Ms. Hamilton for cheating your fans!"
1,I threw mine away!,"The directions were so awful that it took hours to put together, by the time it was assembled, it was ruined! Taking it apart and putting it back together the side cracked. Waste of time and money!"
1,uggh,"I guess as a writer it's a blessing and a curse to be your own publisher AND editor.You get to publish your book as you see fit, but you don't get the objective criticism of a hard boiled editor who tells you what must be cut. The result here is an egocentric mangled mush of smarmy lines.Amazon reviewer ""The Forth World"" sums up the story pretty well, but I gave the book the two stars because, like a few other reviewers here, I found the writing style trite and annoying.The catch to my review is that I only got 20 or pages into the book, and I already knew everything about the story that ""The Fourth World"" said.Yes, it's THAT predictable. I then scanned through the rest of the book, and decided I couldn't take 300 more pages of glib, self indulgent turns like that ""...using my brain as a coffeemaker"" line. In fact, is was that line that was the kiss of death for me."
1,Hypocrisy of the Voice,"These fellows follow a trend in popular music that continues to sustain and promote a sound that many have mistaken for the human voice. Well I suppose it is the human voice, but it is not the natural human voice. It is a put-on unnatural sound delivered with arrogance and decadence to the art. Singing is an art or an art form. There is no question that this boy group is performing within the boundaries of a true art form. The question is one of how well they deliver and achieve status as true artists. And that is a question of talent. Don't see much here."
1,Totally Tasteless,"I wish I can say that this soup cup tastes bad, because even bad taste is taste, but I can't. It is totally tasteless. I coped by adding my own seasoning: garlic salt, Tabasco sauce, sesame oil, etc. The tasteless soup looks like muddy water and the portion of noodles is small, about 3/4 of what I got in a Ramen noodle soup cup, at twice of the price of Ramen. I don't think I will buy this product ever again."
1,"Died After 46 Months, Okay Picture","One of the problems when reviewing computers and related peripherals is timing. By the time users experience the long term durability of a product, it is out of production. Hopefully, potential users can glean information on brand quality and the quality of lower-end products by specific brands if long-term reviews are available. In the case of the Samsung 225BW, the monitor failed 46 months after it was purchased -- less than four years. From the dim flicker and rapid extinguishment of the picture, it appears that the lamp has failed. In general, I have not been happy with low end monitors by Samsung or Dell. My suggestion is to avoid such products because there is no way to evaluate what will fail prematurely."
1,Melonhead,"This is a ridiculously contrived revenge drama penned by one of the most over-rated hacks in America, Elmore Leonard. A melon farmer who happens to be an ace Vietnam combat veteran butts heads with a mob assassin. Happens every day. The film is packed with stereotypes, from the noble Chicano melon-pickers to the gruff police detective to the punk labor contractor to the polyester-enveloped 70's gangsters. It limps along from one poorly staged scene to another until Leonard apparently ran out of cliches. It should have been played for straight comedy since there are so many unintentional laughs in it. Charles Bronson was strictly a supporting character actor and when he stepped into leading roles he simply didn't have enough depth to put himself across."
1,An academic critique - with all the academic faults,"Tylor Monroe (below) is a little harsh - but not very. This book is an academic critique of Wolfe's masterpiece, and like a lot of contemporary academic literary criticism, cannot get out of its own way. Lots of theory, lots of jargon, little illumination of the work for the average reader. This is the sort of book which gets on the author's resume, counts toward his publication list for tenure - and is immediately forgotten!I do not want to say that that all of his ideas are worthless; just that they are very hard to extract from the jargon, and may not be worth the effort."
1,conair sound therapy clock radio,"This clock radio seemed to have all the features I was looking for. The sounds are great. However, the alarms are very hard to set and to shut off. The LED is bright, like others have said, but the numbers in it are nearly impossible to read from anywhere except very close to it and directly in front of it. As a result, we've had to prop it up at a weird angle with books or rolled up socks. It's a real pain. That's the only way we can read the numbers. I would NOT recommend this product if you need to know what time it is!"
1,Not that great,"This camera is ok, but not great.It takes sooo long from the time of the flash to the actual time of the picture, your subject has already moved and you miss that great shot!!I took the camera to Walt Disney World and out of 3500-4000 photos only 10 or so were good shots and those were of things that didnt move!! (like the castle) The shots that you actually get are good quality but I like to take a lot of pic's and I dont have time to waste with making sure everyone stands still for 2-3 seconds (or more) after the flash!I am saving money right now to buy the Canon EOS Rebel XTi. It will take 8-10 pic's in the same time as the Pentax A10's 1."
1,Disappointed,"This toner appeared to be a good deal because of the low price. However, I have never had a cartridge run out of toner so fast. The indicator on my computer still said I had more than half left when it stopped printing. Even after shaking the cartridge it refused to print more than a few pages. Perhaps my cartridge was defective but if this is indicative of all the products, it is hardly a good deal. I guess you only get what you pay for!Dave"
1,Not Happy!,I recieved this product tossed in a large box with out any type of bubble protection. It was so dented from being loose in the box I couldn't even give it to the person I bought it for. I've emailed Amazon.com but they haven't even replied. Guess it's not important to them.
1,TOY IS VERY EDCATIONAL,"THIS TOY IS VERY EDCATIONAL FOR MY 4 1/2 YEAR OLD SON. I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE WHEN CHRISTMAS CAME AND WE OPEN FOR THE FIRST TIME WE COULD NOT GET THE SREW OUT TO PUT THE BATTERY IN. THEIR WERE 5 FAMILY MEMBER TRY AND EVEN THE DEPARTMENT MANGER TRIED WHEN I WENT TO RETURN. I FEEL THAT TOYSRUS SHOULD SEND MY SON SOMETHING FOR HIS DISAPPIONTMENT ON CHRISTMAS DAY, IF IT'S NONTHING BUT A COUPON OFF HIS NEXT PURCHASE. WHY DON'T ASK THEM NOT TO PUT THE SREWS IN SO TIGHT. THANK YOU, I PRAY FOR YOUR COMPANY. GOD BLESS..SIGN A CONCERN PARENT.."
1,dog city,I wasn't that thrilled with this dvd.It was far from one of Jim Henson's best movies. I didn't rate this very high.
1,Let down from book,Horrible let down from the book. Very few ancient customs depicted. Filial relationships lacking. No character development.... No need to interweave future relatioship with that of the two girls from the past. Wasted valuable time and left out so much!
1,Rare 3 CD changer in great sounding system,"The sliding tray style CD changer is easy to load and sort CDs. Hard to find small systems with good multi CD changers now that mp3 players are so dominant.Sounds great- even at low volume levelsNot my preferred style (would have liked a more quiet office mini-stereo style...this looks like a boom box to me- but sound and price more than make up for it.Two year follow up. This unit broke after less than a year of use, the CD changer would no longer load and the unit would auto power down for no apparent reason....really disappointing"
1,junk,"I ordered a similar product made by two other companies at amazon and they worked well. This ""BIC"" came up as I was searching so I figured its on amazon how bad can it be? That will teach me for the next time. I threw these in the trash. In a phrase, don't even think about spending your hard earned money on this garbage."
1,Powder,"As a Christian, I find this movie to be a religious statement in the wrong direction. It has you by the heartstrings much of the time, but feeds you a Beatle's ""everything is one"" world view over and over. If your life goal is to ""explode"" into the universe and be absorbed by the impersonal energy around you, then Powder is the film for you. To the objective soul Powder fizzles!"
1,Nothing special here...,"Granted, I've only had this CD for 3 days. But it really doesn't do much for me. I loved Night Ranger in the 80's and I think Keagy is quite talented. I love his voice.But this album doesn't really grab me. I have listened to it beginning to end about 4 times. The only cut that really stands out is the title track. This is an outstanding and very catchy song. Too bad none of the other cuts stands out the same way..."
1,1 is too many stars,"not funny, save your $$ a real time waster not a good investment of time or money a very poor choice."
1,Rule #1: Use cheap glue to publish your book...,"(I wasn't even halfway finished with the first chapter when the book began to fall apart!)This book, like so many others, has the elitist belief that the reader already has money and simply does not know how to handle it.Here's MY situation: I'm a part-time student/full-time employee in a dead-end job, barely making ends meet. I would like a personal finance book that shows me how to survive in my current situation and save money to put myself into a better situation.Does anyone out there have any ideas?"
1,What The.......!???,"Quick synopsis: These 4 or 5 guys sit around their real estate office for 2 hours talking about not getting good leads....PERIOD.This is SO boriing! I made it through 30 minutes and then I fell asleep. After I woke up I fast forwarded through to get to the GOOD PART, but there is no good part!!!!!!!!!!!!Who wrote the 'good reviews' for this waste of film? Amazon, are you hiring people to do this? Say it isn't so."
1,Couldn't make it past page 50,"This book contains the most stilted dialogue I've seen in a long time. In nearly every sentence the characters address each other by name. ""Isn't it a nice day, Kelly?"" ""Yes it is, Curt."" ""I love days like this, Kelly."" ""I do too, Curt.""That's a slight exaggerations, but if you are used to skilled writing, find another book to read!Ugh!!!"
1,Boring,I had to read this book for school in 4th grade. I was expecting something exciting but I couldn't finish it. I mostly finish addicting books.
1,"Combination of author's previous books, for the most part","This book is roughly about 75% of the info contained in two of the author's other books ""The Perfect Mix"" and ""The Perfect Basket"", with some photos added (the other two books have no photos). Some of it is updated (e.g. CDs instead of cassettes).If you don't need the photos, there is not much new if you already have the other two books (I already had them, thought this was a completely new book).Borrow from the library if you already have the other two books."
1,Damn this is CRAP!!!!!,"ADVANCE NOTE:I'm exactly 13, I'm just using kids review.Whatever.I don't care what you people say!!!This movie sucks enough said. If you want anime, stay farway from this sad excuse for a movie. Even if you are a yugioh fanatic DO NOT WATCH THIS!!!!! OK, you wouln't listen to me. Then go ahead and suffer though 90 minutes of hell. Only a dumbass would reccomend this movie. Even I know enough about yugioh to notice the flaws that occure during the duels. Seriously, don't watch this DVD, don't touch it, Don't look at it and for godsake run away. I'm warning don't get within 10 yards of this movie."
1,not that good,the video does not show tom delogne. way too short. not very entertaining at all!!! some parts are cool. but most them are pretty boring.
1,I agree this book IS garbage,"I used this book as a text in a college heat and mass transfer and despite an overall 3.9 gpa, I managed to fail this class. The book is completely unclear and utterly impossible to decipher. Stay away from this book."
1,My item never arrived!!,"I ordered this item for a friends birthday from iNetVideo and after 3 weeks I wrote to them. It took 2 e-mails for a response and then when i finally recieved a response they just said to 'Please be patient for your order, it takes 4-6 weeks for items to be shipped'. Even though I had recieved an e-mail saying that my item had been shipped 2 days after ordering it on Amazon. I have not recieved any other information."
1,dork eyes,"This guy is joking right, or is he for real??? Let's see it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that this cd is bad. Just take a listen and see if you don't throw up your lunch. I'll pass on this one thank you very much,"
1,Terrible,"The guitar itself was very sleek and high quality. However, when I bought this the included install CD would not work (it was blank) and the drivers and files from the Behringer website did not work properly. The customer service for the product was terrbile from Behringer as this was a discontinued product. I ended up having to return this as I couldn't get it to work properly on my computer."
1,Not a writer whose mind I enjoy,"At first I was impressed with Susan Cheever's apt writing, and excited at the prospect of reading about some of my favorite writers. But reading this book is a little like listening to a friend who enjoys malicious gossip -- embarassing, distasteful, and finally just boring. I get the feeling that some parts are whomped up; she's trying to raise questions that the facts don't justify raising. But mostly there's an edge of bitter glee here -- as if she's enjoying anything negative she can dig up. This isn't the kind of writer with whom I enjoy spending time."
1,is this a knock-off?,I should have known. Other Bissell replacement mop heads are 2 for $19.99. This one was 2 for $9.99 so I thought I had stumbled on a good deal. It did ship promptly. The first time I used the new pad it got holes - YIKES! that's five dollars to wash the kitchen floor- waaay too exspensive. The question is: are these pads some kind of cheap knock-off? They look exactly like the pads that came with the Steam Mop as well as other replacement pads I've bought (but not from this vendor). My opinion is - don't buy these cheap pads the $19.99 ones last a lot longer.
1,"Where are birds, deer, walking in the woods",I now longer can go for walks in the woods or around town.Where is the village square with the New England white chruch?Was there a sunrise or sunset over the mountains or lake?I stopped watching after 30 minutes.maybe it is at the end?The Christmas Carols are fine.Linda22
1,The Basket and handle rusted after 1 wash,I washed the basket and handle with dishwashing soap and the next day there were rust spots in a couple of areas on the metal parts. I don't know if I got a defective product or if I wasn't suppose to wash it with soap (the manual didn't say) but it seems a little cheap that the basket would rust so easily. I hadn't even used it for frying yet either so I would not recommend this product since it may rust before even the first use...
1,Machete,"Danny's performance in Desperado was more ""down to earth"" and entertaining than his role in Machete. Yes, action, violence, and gratuity sex are in this film; however, the director makes Danny take the action to beyond earth heights and far into fantasy. Attempts to suspend disbelief does nothing to regard Danny's knife scenes beyond comical or at best on a par with the wonderous flying martial arts actors who blithly skip on water in Chinese films. Danny is a solid character actor who deserves a better director. The film will make one question their blood lust motives."
1,Waited and waited for it to get better....it didn't,"Like a few others, I don't understand why this novel is getting so many positive reviews. Perhaps I was spoiled by ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" and ""The Good Earth"", but I found the writing lacking and the dialogue boring. Great plot line on paper, but I don't think the author did it justice! Couldn't wait to just get through it and be done with it!"
1,Stupid plot spoils this book,"The sappy, dumb plot of this book about two Pokemon falling in love is enough to turn off the kids who would otherwise be attracted to the book because of its Pokemon theme. While not a fan of Pokemon myself, I buy these books for my first grade son in order to encourage him to read independently. While the plots of all the Pokemon Jr. books are pretty preposterous, they usually have a little humor or action to at least hold a child's interest. This one however is just plain silly and even worse, is not engaging as an early reader book should be."
1,disappointing,very upsetting and a waste of money! Though it was a cream which would be more effective.
1,Absolutely Horrible!!,This is one of the worst books on witchcraft I have ever read. It is sloppily put together and contains an abundance of false information. There are much better books on witchcraft out there.
1,"Wow, personality disorders abundant...","Despite the trailer that was inviting, this movie has two main characters that are extremely dysfunctional. First, the main female character is borderline pathological. She straight up FREAKS me out. Furthermore, the main guy character is a push over with no cajones. Honestly, it was rather painful to watch, but since I paid 3.99 I figured I'd skip along till the end. Boy did waste 4 dollars. I would have asked Redbox for my 1 dollar back if I rented it there. Do yourself a favor, if you're a sane man, don't waste your time and money. If you're a female that may like the twilight saga, mixed with the morning after pill, and some 30 somethings, sure...you may like this."
1,Beautiful (if unexceptional) rehash of the typical Authority plot,"This is a prime example of a title slowly descending into senility and decreptitude.In this ponderous storyline, the superhero team has to fend off an 'extinction-level' event while dealing with their personal/emotional/romantic entanglements. Essentially, it identical to every other post-Warren-Ellis Authority storyline.Ridley is a talented screenwriter, and this reads too much like a neatly-contained, solved-in-90-minutes blockbuster, and not enough like a continuation of one of the (formerly) best titles on the market.The art - Ben Oliver is terrific - has earned this book a place on my bookshelf, but otherwise, this would go straight back to the shop."
1,Ulitmate on my laptop - a flop,"This software does not work properly on my Sony laptop. I can see the games, but the mouse(pad) doesn't show up. It is simply a flittering shadow and I can't play the games."
1,too hard to swallow,This book was hard to read. Not something you can scan thru quickly. The pages are difficult to naviagate and difficult to find the real meat.
1,warranty nightmare :(,I had initially given a strong review. I wish I could take it back. nothing but trouble and these guys are really nasty with wrranty. dead so early and a refurb?
1,You Can Have Mine!,"I bought this to use in baking. As a low-carber of many years, I have learned to use several dry ingredients together to take the place of plain flour. Even though I only use this as part of the dry ingredient mix, the soy taste is still prevalent in the end result. I now add just a tablespoon or so to my baked goods just so that I can use it up, but I will never buy it again. Everything else I have used from Bob's Red Mill has been very good, so I had higher hopes for this product."
1,Looks cool on the picture but not so cool to put together,Took forever to put this together and then found not all the parts were included. It's also not as durable as we had hoped. I'm very surprised coming from playmobil that it was not better made.
1,Norton does not deserve one star!!,"I regret spending any money on the Norton Internet Security 2004.Please don't purchase this product. You will be flushing your money away! It almost crashed my computer, it was so slow you could take a nap just logging on. I un-installed the software, and my computer works great now. I just dont have any anti-virus Security. I think Norton needs to make a patch or something to fix this problem. I'm not the only one that has had problems with this product.Anna"
1,Good read for ostriches,"If you want to believe that there are no serious environmental problems on this planet, this book is for you."
1,too hard to read!!,I started reading this book and quit. It is written in an old english that is so hard to understand it made my head hurt. Buy a newer version that has been rewritten in todays language.
1,Wrong item advertized,Beware if you buy this item from Goodman. They will send you the 5-piece serving set and not the hostess set as listed and described. You will notice that the 2 images shown are not the same! I don't know why they don't correct this mistake. They sent me a refund but never explained the mistake.
1,It's no good for PAL DV Cameras,"Before buying this DV card, I looked carefully to see if this card is only for NTSC systems. Surprisingly, this info is not available anywhere and after hooking up my PAL DV camera, I ralized it's not working ... total waste of money as I am outside the US and returning would cost as much as what I spent on the card."
1,"I would give it zero starts, if I could","I bought this book as part of the Ambleside Online homeschooling curriculum, intending to read it to my children. Fortunately I did not hand it to them to read as I had to change significant portions of it so that they wouldn't hear racist information from their history text.I understand that there are biases in every history text, but there has to be something better than this book. Good writing cannot make up for all of the major problems with this book."
1,More trouble than it's worth,Same problem as several other reviewers. Random false alarms at not so nice times of night. Total and complete waste of money.
1,Comfortable....for 3 days,"While this seat cover did provide comfort for my long rides home from work, it only lasted three days. By the second day the fabric that covers the gel was starting to stretch and tear. By the third day it was almost completely torn at which point I took off the cover and put in an order for a new seat. Do yourself a favor and just spend the extra $10-20 on a new seat. I paid $30 for a seat that has worked great and is more comfortable than this pad was."
1,Just not fun,"I love tae bo, and thought I'd give Kathy's version a try. I thought it might be more challenging, or just add some variety to my workouts. I did the DVD twice and yes, it got my heart rate up and all, but it was just dull! The ""advanced workout"" was a joke - the same workout, but with ""challenge"" moves at the end, after my heart rate had gone down! My advice: try TaeBo II instead. The basic tapes are easy but the advanced ones are tough, and a lot more FUN to do than this workout!"
1,Ending does not ring true,"Yes, the two irrepressibly cute characters in this book do indeed share everything. In fact, in the end the boy and girl end up taking off their clothes and switching them with each other while in their kindergarten classroom. Having taught kindergarteners within the last five years, this ending rang completely false with me. This is NOT behavior typical of kindergarteners, but more that of toddlers and young preschoolers. The kindergarteners I taught would not be caught dead taking their clothes off at school! Munsch strikes out on this one."
1,Doesn't work as a book stand,"I bought this item to use as a book stand. It does not work for this purpose! What a waste of my time and money. If you have a book that will stay open when you lay it flat, then that book MIGHT work with the stand. Paperback books, of most common sizes, will not stay open when placed in the ""stand"". If you want a book stand look elswhere -- I will."
1,About what you'd expect,"Imagine every bad scene in each of these actors' careers, all rolled into one movie. Yeah, it's just that good!"
1,"Excellent tunes are lost in dated arrangements, muddy mix","This is a CD of the '65 - '73 period, featuring Harris on tenor sax, often embellished with a Conn multivider and studio manipulation. The Harris sound is unique -- soulful, breathy, reaching for the highest register, and wonderfully melodic. Many of the tunes are icons of the period, if not standards. Regrettably, they have not weathered very well over the past 30 years. Arrangements are dated, reminiscent of the TV themes of the '70's. Remember ""Hawaii 5-0""? Creed Taylor? The arrangers on this album went to the same school. And the mix sounds as if Harris were in the linen closet while the rhythm section was in the studio. Regrettably, there were 6 producers credited on this disc, which is 5 too many."
1,I'd give fewer stars if I could,"This thing is junk. Not hot enough. I think a little kid could drink my coffee, that's how cold it gets. NEEDS MORE POWER!!!"
1,Unsubstantiated and belabored.,"Despite the claim of the subtitle, the author can never really tell us why children don't think and what we can do about it. Every word of this book may be true; unfortunately, very little is substantiated. If repetition and anecdote proved anything, this would be a masterpiece. As it is, the book is four times the length it needs to make the points it makes.Until social scientists can unscramble the myriad of possible factors, e.g., single parenting, TV, video games, fluoride, we are just whistling Dixie. It is not even clear that there is a problem. I thought the author dismissed the Flynn Effect too matter of factly."
1,"Get the 7 Inch, not this one.","I'll admit it, I wasn't paying attention to the size and reviews when I ordered. I thought it would be bigger and it's my fault for the 1 star rating. I hold myself accountable, not the product.Ignore all the reviews where everyone says, ""I'm glad I didn't get the bigger one."" I can only assume they're speaking out of buyer's remorse too. Well, I'm not shy to admit I have remorse and wanted the bigger one.Look, if you you boil your pasta in 9.5""+ pot like most everyone in the modern world then the 7 Inch spider fits better. The whole purpose of this device is to get as much as possible with one scoop to supplicant the use of a strainer or Colander.The 5"" spider is still a well made piece for the price. If you truly want a 5"" spider then buy with confidence and in your mind my review can be that of 5 stars."
1,Worst dog ever...,"Beautiful costumes. So what! Stolen music. Never mind that, they probably wanted to save money or didn't want to hire a good composer. Beautiful dance sequences destroyed by poor camera work. When skillful dancers are doing their thing I don't want to see ceseless closeups of heads or feet. I want good lighting, and love to see the whole figure, not a palette of color from 50 feet up in the air. (As an example of good camera work for dace sequences, ""Center Stage"" comes to mind). For the first 42 minutes of ""Moulin Rouge,"" the camera never pauses more than 5 seconds on anything. When it does, it's such a relief you feel like crying, but you can't because you already have a terrible head ache. Oh, the plot is nice, but that's too little too late. This dog will go to the pound in a short time. It's an atrocity done with a lot of promotion. They wanted to buy an Oscar. Fortunatelly they didn't, but a lot of people was fooled by the hype, including myself."
1,yawn...a typically boring exhibit of our times,"it's no accident that a divorce quickly followed the publication of this pathetic ""work.""you almost can't blame the ex-husband (no, I wouldn't go so far as to call him a photographer or artist). he is just doing what is popular today, but there is certainly nothing daring here. it is what everyone else is doing.there is also nothing sexy here because there is no mystery and no intimacy.for that you need a closed door."
1,"great writer, bad book","I could write a book full of factual and analytical errors in this book. For an avowed fan of metal and a paid rock critic, Klosterman knows little more about the subject than the names of the band members. Virtually everything else in this book is incorrect. There are the occasional witty one-liners and a few slightly interesting stories, but the overly lengthy yet superficial analysis--and countless inaccuracies--are too annoying to make any of this worth the trouble."
1,A huge disappointment,I wish there was negative reviews for this work. The first problem was the previews. The previews were awesome and actually told most of the story. When I got to the film however nothing from the previews was in the movie. The 1st and 2nd movies rocked and are worth the price however the quality ends there. Don't waste your money on this one and I never saw the fourth one.Ultimately if you can't make your movies match your previews then something is seriously wrong with your work.
1,that game was broken,"i cant believe it out of all the things ive orded and this was the only item by far that didnt work. It was a gift and the child was very sad and upset. they need better processing for the used items. Not only that i recieve everything fast except my return envelope for the game, for the refund."
1,STOLEN WORDS!,"Taken virtually *word for word* from the Book(s) of Shadows of the College [Coven] of Three Cranes ~ and written as though it is her own work. Self proclaimed 'High Priestess-3rd Degree-Elder-Druid-Witch-Wiccan' Ms Knight (aka Barbara Swanson) apparently dismissed the Craft teachings and concepts of Self Honesty and Self Responsibility when writing this, and most of her other books as well."
1,Piece of garbage,I have had this piece of garbage for over a year...shame on me for keeping it...you get what you pay for....noisiest! Clanking and banging back and forth....I have used more ink just resetting this so called consumer best buy. Just try and print out an envelope... I have tried to allign after each new cartridge and I get error cartridge stuck...or page did not finish printing...I hope this machine is outdated and would NOT recommend this to anyone! Save the money!Frustrated in Jersey
1,Not what I expected,Seems to me this was made just for the money. It is only 30 minutes long! What a rip off.
1,Red Hawk Pedal Go-kart,This go-kart is supposedly produced by Kettler. I could not find any indication that this go-kart has been in fact produced by Kettler. Neither on the box nor in the product insert nor on any other part is the name Kettler mentioned as manufacturer. It is produced in Thailand. The quality of this go-kart is very poor. The seat construction is a catastrophe. For me the most annoying thing is that our 3 year old son cannot use it since the go-kart is far to big for a 3 year old child. And our son is above average height. In other words the age recommendation which is given by the manufacturer and Amazon is not correct. I strongly discourage people to buy this item. Rather spend some money for something more robust.
1,Attracts Moles,"I bought two of these because some of the reviews said these work great. They vibrate,the sun powers them, but it doesn't scare the moles away. Imagine my dismay when I saw the earth raised up right next to my Solar Moler. I bought two and placed them where I had my mole problem about twenty feet apart. Every day I'd see where new tunnels had been dug some within inches of my solar molar. Don't waste your money."
1,Huge let down.,I was led to believe that this mouse was going to be capatible with bluetooth and it isn't. I have to constantly sync the mouse with the receiver to get the mouse to connect and work. I should have saved my money and just lived with the generic USB wired mouse that came with my laptop.
1,"Inspiration from a crabby, selfish, person is impossible","The story highlights the author's egomania. She talks about people she's encountered as if she has met the devil himself. The list of her foes include her husband, daughter, husband, as well as basically all nurses and doctors.It was difficult to be inspired by a person encouraging compassion when she had so little for others"
1,why waste the money?,"My brother bought this cookbook for me 2-3 years ago for Christmas and I have yet to crack it open. You can go online to the foodnetwork website and get all her recipes for free (but why would you???) after seeing some of her more recent episodes, I am ready to toss the book in the trash without even taking a glimpse of the inside. Her recipes scare me and I wouldn't feed half of what she makes to my dog. Don't waste the money. If you think you wanna try her recipes, print them free from the web first before you go investing money in her empire."
1,Quicken,"I have been using quicken since '92 and it is awful. They have no customer service and will not even return a email inquiry. Someone needs to come along and shake these guys up. Microsoft has almost the identical program. But, they want to control everything you do.Somebody out there, please, create a new program, before I go back to writing it by hand. Most of the garbage in this program is useless."
1,Gather Harmony Lacking,"I was seriously disappointed with the CD. I am a major fan of the BillGaither Homecoming series of CDs and DVDs; I especially love the harmonies of the singing, the soul-lifting full chorus harmonies and the heavenly vocal blends of the smaller groups in the Gaither entourage. Unfortunately, little of that is evident on this CD. I enjoyed Mark Lowry's rendition of ""Mary, Did You Know?"", one of the selections that drew me to this recording, but I found little else to like here. There's even some spoken recitation, which I find distacting. I can't recommend this CD."
1,Panasonic NEVER again,"Door BLEW OPEN on my Panasonic microwave while using it to boil water for coffee in a cup I've been using for months! Called Panasonic and right away they had me talk to their lawyer. All he cared about was getting the microwave in their possession (maybe getting rid of evidence?). When I asked about getting it replaced, they said after they had it and checked it out, they would let me know. How do they expect me to be without a microwave oven for 2 weeks? 4 weeks? When I said I couldn't wait that long, since I have to feed my family, the lawyer said that is the legal agreement I consented to by buying the oven. My only solution is to buy a another microwave. I feel like a fool for buying a Panasonic. Never again."
1,a book that tries my patience,"I picked this book to read while waiting for my flight in ""January"" and I haven't finshed with it yet. I normally don't take much time to read one book. But this book just tries my patience. I'm still trying to finish it sheerly out of my tenacity and I'm almost there.I don't understand what the author is trying to say. Creating a good adult fairy tale? Well, I have had far better ones. Giving satirical version of current politics? Real-world affairs on TV are more informative. Basically I can't take away anything from this book.I first blamed my ignorace for failing to grasp the meaning, if any, of this book but reading other reviews here, I felt relieved that it wasn't just me. I will definitely not recommend this book to others. Just go and watch the play."
1,A couple of good ideas and filler,"The author has a couple of good ideas: management is about building processes not about managing people, and the value of a practice is it's process. The problem is that we get no details about how develop such processes. Instead we get a bunch of meaningless psychobabble about change and motivation and the same two presmises simply repeated over and over again. This is nothing like a practical guide on how to rework a medical practice."
1,have not got online game code and i ordered 20 mins ago,i want my money back if i can not get on line code please hurry i want my msp so i can use them on my xbox 360
1,Nothing new here...,"This book was pretty much a waste of money, especially if you have any ASP programming experience and take time to look at and learn from the included sample stores that come with MSCS. Worse yet is that the code in the book contains erros and there are no updates or other information on the publisher's web site to acknowledge it (or seemingly any interest of them to even reply to my reports). Microsoft's TechNet has helpful resources and is free online at their web site. Wrox also publishes a book called Site Server 3.0 Commerce Edition which isn't much better. It seems that most book publishers are taking the information presented in the Microsoft Official Curriculum Course (1231) and keep rehasing the same old stuff over and over and over... Anyone who thinks they can master Business to Consumber or Business to Business commerce by reading this book, Wrox's or taking Microsoft's own course will be in a for a disappointing surprise."
1,"INSOMNIA? Well, listen to this!","I have been a dedicated Bunnymen fan for many years. My friends used to make fun of me because of it(what do they know?). I absolutely love everything up to and including Echo's 1987 self-titled album. Evergreen was ok (love Altamont), but if I'm asked to describe What Are You Going To Do With Your Life?, only 3 words come to mind: BIG 'OLE SNOOZE!!!!!! Forget about Unisom, or any other over-the-counter sleep aid. Just give a listen to this album. I like Rust and Get In The Car, but other than that, ZZzzzzz..............! The other two tracks on the CD single ""Rust"" were pretty good. This album was just too mellow. They should have tried balancing it out with a few classic Bunnymen sounds. It's worth buying anyway. I guess you can always use it for medicinal purposes!"
1,Universal Soldier2 doesn't cut it.,"This was supposed to be part 2 of the original Universal Soldier with Jean Claude returning as the hero. Note that there was already a low budget knock off of #2 and #3 previously released without Jean Claude. Unfortunately, this low-budget sequel had none of the ambiance or realism that the original movie contained. In fact, if not for the title, you would not have known that this was the second part. Nothing from this movie linked the first movie (except for an occasional flash back). The weapons and outfits were poor. The premise was weak and and the special effects were either poor (as in bullets bouncing off car windows) or non existent. The only thing that carried over from the last movie (and all his other movies) was Jean Claude getting beatup through-out the movie in spite of the fact that he was supposed to be a ""Universal Soldier"" hinself. We were are pretty dissappointed with this one. It was a comedic ripoff of a good film."
1,Problems,"I bought this DVD Recorder about a week ago. You can't beat the price, which is the lowest I've seen, but I have problems with the sound going out when I try to do a timed recording, and at various other times for no obvious reason. I'm going to return it and try another brand. Even when the sound is working, it moves very slowly through the menus, takes up to 10-15 minutes to finalize a DVD-R disk, and often has long waiting periods when you do a simple function, like press ""stop."""
1,Disappointment,"I'm a HUGE Whitecross fan, and this album is a disappointment compared to their other albums. The first song is awesome, and there a couple other pretty good ones. The rest of the album though is just OK at best. I would love to get the song Flytrap on an MP3 download."
1,for big-time incubus fans only,"I'm a fairly hardcore incubus fan, and if you're new to the band, don't get this album first. Get ANY of their other albums. This is all early stuff, and even Brandon Boyd (the lead singer) says on the CD jacket that this is pretty low quality music."
1,Can I give this item no stars? AWFUL,"This item is a despicable piece of trash. It is cut like wearing a trash bag, seriously, VERY misleading picture on the package. Not sexy in the least. And on top of that, the wings flop over and stay in the holder for 5 seconds, if you can even manage that. The choker was missing in my package, but the arm sleeves were itchy and awful, so I'd imagine the choker would feel the same.Overall, I've never been so disappointed with an item. Oh, and as for the fit, besides laying like a garbage bag, the small is enormous. I'm an average, size 2-4, the ""small"" was more like an 8. Terrible item that wasn't even salvageable through some creative tailoring. I recommend avoiding this item. It's a cheap piece of junk."
1,Not as advertised.,"This is a U3 Flash Drive. This is important information which was not included in the seller's description. I had to do a Google Search to find a removal tool for unwanted and space wasting U3 software from this drive. The construction is flimsy, being very poor quality plastic. The slider is also not well constructed. I was afraid the drive would break every time I plugged it in or pulled it our. Definitely not what I had in mind when I saw the brand name SanDisk. That company can do much better. But as a Gift Certificate buy, these drives are not the worst thing I could have selected.Overall, you can do much better with other models/ brands."
1,"MORE SEASONS, NOOOOOOOOO!","The more the simpsons go on, the more they SUCK! the fist 2 or 3 seasons were ok, but then they get dumb, and not at all funny!! the comidy has already been done in other shows, or other seasons, or it is just plain STUPID! If you like comidy buy Family Guy! The comidy in that is at it's heighest! Some of the comidy in that is pretty funny, and not as repetitive! And Family Guy has actually funny Slap-Stick humor, unlike season 4 and up on the simpsons!! DO NOT BUY THIS, I GARANTEE THAT YOU WILL NOOOOOOOOOT LAUGH YOUR GUTS OUT!"
1,The downward spiral continues,"John Grisham no longer writes novels--he's cranking out screenplays now--and boy are they preachy.If you thought The Street Lawyer was bad, wait until you get your hands on this one. It ought to come with its own soapbox.Very disappointing. Where do I go to get back the four hours I wasted on this?"
1,Did not enjoy it,After reading many of her articles which used poor fact checking and overt reliance on elites - I felt this book was boring even though it was not as overtly bias in its politics as her newspaper writing.
1,6 months and died - a far cry from my trusty RT-314...,"The sad thing about this is that it's only 6 months old and it went brain-dead while I'm deployed to Afghanistan with the Army. I thought I would have better luck than the dozens of other reviewers that had this router die on them, but I was mistaken. I had a Netgear RT-314 router that ran continuously for nearly 5 years without failing before going wireless with this router, so I'm really bummed that Netgear would produce such a problem-ridden router that so many people are dissatisfied with. I replaced it with a Cisco SOHO 91 to get my family back on line reliably until I return home in 6 months. When the replacement WGR614 comes in I'll just use it as an access point to get rid of the cable I had to run to my son's room, but I'll keep that cable standing by for when the replacement dies in 6 months again."
1,Pass on this!,"These are NOT natural looking eyebrows! They are actually pretty funny looking. I couldn't stop laughing when I put them on. You can see the backing through the brows. They are also much, much bigger than real eyebrows should be. Whey I put them on, they were the size of my entire forehead. Take a pass and try to find something smaller. These went straight into the trash."
1,the rich guy yuppie diet,"Well, I did buy this book and read it thoroughly. I really was not that impressed with it. Unfortunatly it reminded me of why i stopped reading Men's Health magazine. That is, it works way to hard at capturing masculinity through looks and physical strength. Its pretty shallow stuff.The work out is a good one. But the diet is fairly hard to deal with. Its not the food choices. Those are fine. ITS THE FACT THAT THE WEEKLY MENU COSTS AN ARM AND A LEG! This is a diet for rich guys or yuppie editor/writers who can write it off as a work expense.Blue collar joes with low incomes need not attempt this diet. You'd end up spending a fortune on it in the nine weeks they give you and then what happens when you come to the end of the nine weeks and have to maintain it for life? who the heck can buy the amounts of food they require and the brand names they require! not me."
1,Do not buy this lamp,"I bought this lamp thinking it was going to look like the photo and description, clear liquid with black lava/wax, but the liquid was a cloudy white color. You can barely see the black wax through the murk. So I thought maybe I just need to turn it on for a while and the liquid might clear up. I left it on for 3 hours and it was still cloudy. Maybe I received a defective product, but from my experience I would not recommend this lava lamp."
1,had to throw away fishy,"Don't buy this product it taists fishy, I had to throw away. Item came on time but would not purchase. Would not recommend."
1,the blue elephant,"this film is trash do not buy this for your children i had to turn it off in 5 min to much name callingvery viloet talk, was so surprise that this was in children dvd it is very bad for young kids alot of bullying in iti will not let my child see this trash ,i thought that by title and film cover this would be for kids its not"
1,Give me a break,"This is a horrible sounding CD and these bands are like ""GLAM POSERS"" acting like they are heavy! Pass on this at all costs!"
1,Don't recommend this item,"I would absolutely not recommend this particular potty ladder to anyone.I had seen one similar to it and was quite disappointed with the one I ordered.It's back in the box waiting for my next yard sale, or I may take it to the Salvation Army.Guess I should just take the trouble to return it.Thanks for asking.Carol TribblePinckney, MI"
1,An eggnog hangover,I love Stephanie Plum and am quite fond of good fantasy. However the two do not mesh well. Who is Sandy Claws? We never do find out. Who is Ring? What is Diesel? Do we care? This plot does not allow a willing suspension of disbelief. Please borrow this book from the library. You will hate yourself in the morning if you pay full price for what is essentially a short story.
1,Handset problems are true!,"We bought this phone a couple of months ago. The handset no longer holds a charge, and constantly complains if it's not put back on the base immediately after each use. You cannot check the messages on the answering machine when you are actually using the handset on a call, either. The caller ID funtion is counterintuitive. We hoped this phone would work for all our needs, but it has proven only to frustrate the entire family. We do not reccomend this phone, or others by Uniden."
1,Not what it seemed,"This was a surrealistic look at Margaret Thatcher and the trailer is totally misleading. It cut in and out of her life which I suppose was as an elderly woman, portraying her somewhat with dementia and delusions with some info from flashbacks? to the time that she was Prime Minister and how she got there. There were four of us watching this we all came away wondering what that was about. It felt like a Dali painting you know its supposed to be a woman but the parts are all over the place.Margaret Thatcher was a fascinating woman she deserved better....Meryl Streep, the real selling point in the trailer was, as usual fabulous."
1,Horrible Violent/Upsetting Event NOT SUITABLE FOR KIDS,I can't comment on the portion beyond the very disturbing/violent incident...I'm an adult and was upset for months after reading it. This book is NOT APPROPRIATE FOR KIDS.
1,Pocket Kit,"I am somewhat disappointed with this product. First of all, it is made of cheap plastic and has a cheap look to it. Then while trying to install it, the side tabs (to adapt it to my car) kept falling out. After installing it, the bottom pocket is bowed in on the top and bottom. Also beware that the bottom pocket can be easily pushed down into your dash because it is held in from behind with four tiny plastic tabs. This product does not have the fit and finish you would want to put in your late model Ford car or truck. I will be buying a different one next time."
1,Keep the CD in a safe place and re-learn graffiti,"This Palm uses a new flavor of Grafitti, which is giving me fits. There's no way to use the old version.The installation CD is essential if you ever need to reinstall the software. I had a system crash, and though I could get the desktop software from the Palm web site, I could not reinstall the Outlook-synchronization conduit. To do this, you must have the original CD, which I've lost. Palm wants $25 just to talk to tech support and more $$$ to get a copy of the installation CD. You cannot get a CD via email tech support."
1,We almost didn't finish it....,It was so boring. Not as funny as we were hoping. There were 4 of us (2 of us in our 30's and 2 teenagers) and we all HATED it!
1,Hopkins leads a Patriachy cult at Burnet Bible Church,"Please do not read this man's book. I have a good friend whose children are being taken away from her, because she wouldn't follow him lock step. These people may as well be in Waco at a compound. The Bible is clear that the man of the house is to be the servant leader as Jesus was the ultimate example. Jesus didn't give marching orders or hand out commands, on the contrary, he implored us, to love our neighboor as ourself, to treat others with higher regard.No, Steve and Sandra say you have to obey your husbands no matter what. You are the husband's servant. Cook him dinner. Clean the house. Teach the children. Blah, Blah. We can only pray for this wicked misdirected movement. Go to patriarchy dot org to learn about these misguided ideas and Christianity going astray."
1,"Don't buy, it will corrupt your files, and lose saves!!!","I bought this product after reading that you can update the code list via a network connection, or using a USB flash drive. I have not been able to get either to work correctly. After following their instructions on the Datel website on how to update the codes using a USB drive, it deleted my game saves on the memory card. It also corrupted the memory card, and corrupted saves on the card in slot 2. I have had nothing but trouble with it, it's slow and doesn't live up to the promises. Their customer support is lousy, with a response that merely said...sorry. Well thanks a lot to them...just lost hours of game saves!!!"
1,Basic writing and character development,"The story line was okay, but there was almost no character development. I felt like the whole thing might just have been an edited version containing only first lines of each paragraph, because there was so little to flesh out who these people are and why they relate to one another as they do (or don't). At least the book was free."
1,Painful Reading At Best,"This book, for the most part is written from the viewpoint of a character that can only write phonetically. Also he speaks with a strong scottish accent. (""ef I 1/2 2"" = ""If I have to""). And this goes on for hundreds of pages. I found myself struggling to decipher passages and at the end the sheer fact that I am a Banks fan kept me going to finish it. I think this was a literary experiment - one that did not work. If you can't find a regular mass market version used, or its not in the library, skip it. This is barely about the culture anyway -- and the payoff isn't worth the struggle."
1,not his cup of tea,"Good writing and style. But he does know anything about pop music and, incidentally, pop is the book's core."
1,downloading problem,"I have received your Vivicam10 digital camera this past week. I have tried downloading it to my Windows XP but get nothing but memos saying my system is not compatible and to contact the supplier. I can find no phone number, email address or----- would like to be able to try it out but don't know where to go from here."
1,boobahs stink!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"boobahs are a wasted piece of plastic.you should not buy this pathetic toy!!!!!it is loud,annoying and dumb.no affence or anything,but if you buy this toy you have lost your mind!!!spend your money on something important,not this pink piece of junk.boobahs are ugly too.it will give your children nightmares! please please PLEASE dont buy this pink junk!!!!!!!"
1,WARNING Counterfeit Product,"I bought one of these counterfeit CHI's a couple of months ago and discovered it was counterfeit by calling CHI. CHI is currently suing Amazon for continuing to sell the fake product on it's site. I just learned of fake Canon lenses being sold on Amazon as well. Since Amazon started allowing third party venders, the company has been awash in counterfeit and unscrupulous product sales.I just bought an adapter that Amazon claims works with 27"" iMacs to connect blu rays too. What Amazon fails to tell customers is that the iMac must be two years old or older to work. After getting duped into buying the product, Amazon forces the buyer to deal with bogus third party venders to return items. I'd rather pay the extra and forgo the hassle and risk of getting ripped off."
1,Not worth wasting time over.,"I sincerely hope that teenagers who have read this book have not been caught in a fantasy of undying romantic love. It's a nice enough story, but written in a trite overly-poetic manner. Gosh! Who speaks crap like ""I am like a Peregrine...etc."" And funny how Francesa gets over her guilt very fast. She is supposed to be a deep and sensitive person isn't she? Very few persons in their sane minds woud leave a legacy for their children detailing their extra-marital affairs. Robert Kincaid the macho man gets a chain bearing the name ""Francesa"" and pines for her till his death????? How much more unrealistic can you get? The only plus point is the description of the country that is vivid, you can picture locales very easily in your mind's-eye. This book is strictly for the ""Use and throw"" kind - like killing time on a short plane trip and the like."
1,Such a let down,"Seriously? Dating myself here, the first concert I ever went to was an Econoline Crush/God Lives Underwater/Stabbing Westward show and its was amazing. Econoline was touring on the Devil You Know which was awesome.Don't bother with this pile. Terrible follow up...Canadians."
1,Positives results ambiguous.,"I bought these test strips because of the price and the first few the reviews seem good (read a few back). But, after using them and getting results which needed a lot of interpretation and guessing, I bought a Clear Plan Ovulation test kit and tested with both Wondfo strips and Clear Plan. When Wondfo gave a negative result according to their directions ( test line lighter than control line), Clear Plan gave me a straight up positive.Don't waste your important TIME with these. You could miss your ovulation period. Most other test with a yes/no result are almost the same price for a few less strips."
1,Very disappointing,"Don't waste your money on this iron. It takes longer to iron garments with this iron. The soleplate quickly developed a build-up of crud, and following the manufacturer's directions for cleaning (ironing a cloth soaked with white vinegar) did not remove the build-up. Finally, the rubber strain-relief at the point where the power cord connects to the iron body broke after one month of ownership."
1,"No here, not there","Unfortunately this dvd is not upto the quality of other salsacrazy products. Neither is good to learn salsa nor as a workout routine.The salsa steps are covered too briefly and only from the man point of view (so ladies can't learn their steps), but at the other side the steps you need to learn are too complex for a workout.If you want to learn salsa get The complete salsa mastery from SalsaCrazy. For effective workout, get something else."
1,Nothing to see,"Their gimmick is that they're naked. That's it. The songs are lame too. Ok, the song ""Nothing but the Radio on"" is clever, but that's only a couple of minutes in an entire show. Really not worth buying or even renting."
1,"Poor book, considering who wrote it.","I generally liked this book. It was well-written and is a very quick read.However, I do have some complaints. There are no footnotes on where the author found her quotes, only a thin bibliography of the author's sources. The last chapter on Alexandra Of Denmark and her sister Dagmar is, by far, the weakest chapter. It should have been titled ""Alexandra"", for it barely has anything on Princess Dagmar and her influence on Russia. She also gets her geneology mixed up.If you find this book at the library then I encourage you to pick it up and read it. Otherwise, don't waste your time or money in searching for this out-of-print book.The best thing that I can say of this book is that it will get you interested in its subjects. If you do wish to read more about royal subjects, then go to Frasers."
1,UNpleasantly surprised,"Imagine my surprise when I stepped onto this scale for the first time and it informed me that I had gained 20 lbs in 4 days. I trust the previous reading since it was at the beginning of my annual physical. So I tested it against four other scales, all which were within 4 pounds of the Doctor's scalle. The final straw came when a guest used it and found, to her chagrin, that she had gained 22.5 lbs during her nine hour road trip from Flagstaff to Los Angeles."
1,Poor Choice,"I found this pail on clearance at my local Walmart, and now I know why it was on clearance. First off, the size is just barely big enough for normal store plastic sacks. You have to stretch them pretty far, which cuts the capacity that it holds in half. Luckily my place of employment has bags that fit this perfectly. Second, there is no latch system. You can just pull the lid right off and kids or animals can dig through all the dirty diapers. Finally, there is the smell. This pail has ZERO smell control, even when the lid is closed. The room this is will reek the second a poopy diaper is placed in the pail and won't change until you empty the bag."
1,Blah!,This movie is so blah. I really couldn't get pass the fake wife who was like 90lbs was basically the toughest person in the whole movie.
1,Oh so gay!,"Milksops shouldn't try to sound like Rat-packers!This is the most harmless and dullest album I've heard for a long time. Michael Bublé is a nice boy singing nice songs - its all so nice! The problem is that this stuff just doesn't sound convincing unless it is sung by a hard-drinking, hard-womanising wise guy who has lived a little!However, this album does have the G Factor going for it - Gays, Grannies and [young] Girls will buy it. So there is a market for this sugary stuff. As for everyone else, why settle with this faux-Rat-Packer when there are so many good recordings made by the real thing - i.e. Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr.Nice try, Bubbles! Better luck next time."
1,Who Engineered This Thing?!!!!,"I purchased two ""metoo"" chairs for my twin girls. Clearly neither Phil or Ted are engineers. THE CLAMPS SUCK!!!! Why would you not employ standard ""C Clamp"" technology on this chair the fixed flat portion of the bolt results in friction with bottom of your targeted surface which makes it virtually impossible to tighten well. Standard ""C"" clamps employ a floating heading that sets still while you tighten the clamp. The addition of the rubber sleeves is even more dangerous since it introduces a softer cushion that easily slips. The fact that the ""Lobster"" has been introduced shows this chair was not the ""ultimate"" product. Phil, Ted, you made a pretty lousy product; what are you going to do about it?!!!!!"
1,Very disappointed with order,"I ordered shoes for our aniversary for my husband,and those are all he wears,well they came and were blue with flat bottoms,not sperry billfish,so i had to return them and needless to say i was without aniversary gift for my husband,first time i have been disappointed with ordering online..my husband loves the sperry's and this type is all he will wear...he wears them till they are pitiful and i make him get a new pair..."
1,A total bummer. Don't waste your money.,"Bad, bad, bad. Uneven toasting, a bagel setting that doesn't work, weird burning around the perimeter of just about every kind of bread. I have other Kitchenaid products and love them (clothes washer, dish washer), but I will be avoiding their countertop products in the future."
1,"play the game, skip the movie","I was disappointed in ""Samurai Shodown"". This is just another example of a good video game turned into a bad movie. Anime fans should stay away from this one. The dubbing is terrible (as with most voiceovers) and the characters have been a bit twisted from the video game image. The plot leaves something to be desired. My advice, buy the game and play it, forget the movie."
1,Original ideas? Not so much...,"Not sure if this is some type of spin-off of the original or part of a series. However, I recommend that you simply pick up this five minute read at the library and use the $ saved for gas [to/from the library] and a cup of Starbucks while reading it."
1,Pinwheels Spinning,"I have four pinwheels. Only two of them spin freely in the wind. The manufacturer recommends that if you have pinwheels that don't turn, you should gently reshape their blades. I've done this without success. I love stainless steel, so I am disappointed in the pinwheel's performance. I am sure the pinwheel could have been engineered to spin better."
1,"References, NOT Allusions","While this book has many interesting tidbits of information that may make their way into writing, they are most definitely not allusions. At best they are simply literary REFERENCES and therefore this book provides little beyond what you would find in a typical encyclopedia entry about the keyword. Who was Ahab, Frodo, Medusa, etc. Where is hell, olympus, or Narnia. What was manna and so on. Unfortunately, the examples follow the same pattern. Whereas an allusion is indirect and subtle, the examples in this book are direct and explicit references to the keywords (ie ""He was crazy like Ahab,"" instead of something like a subtle quotation from Moby Dick suggesting the character of Ahab). I got this book mainly for the examples in order to see the different ways allusions have been used, but all the examples are simply examples of literary references, not allusions."
1,very disappointing,I was horribly disappointed by this book. The author obviously never watched the 6th season and it shows. She wrote Spike out of character for this season. I was really hoping that this book would show the developement Spike has gone through the past year but it was neglected. Also are we really suppose to believe that after 4 years Buffy is still not over Angel? I felt that the authtor made Buffy look pathtic in that aspect.
1,ABACUS PDA Watch Sucks,"Hey there. I got this PDA Watch 2 weeks ago and hardly have used for 1 hour. Most of the time the watch screen won't respond to the stylus. Advised by the tech-support, I reset the watch everytime and lost data, but with no advantage. There might be bugs in the Palm OS loaded that runs the watch, or just mine one is a defective piece.But in general, its a bad design, with a tiny screen and even a tiner stylus, which needs a magnifying glass to pick and write. Its never cool, neither by size nor by looks nor by functionality. Avoid . Avoid . . Avoid . . .Me ? I am still struggling to catch hold of TigerDirect call center, who would put you on hold for hours, also their music sucks as their product."
1,Not very creative.,"This album was a bit disappointing. I listen to a lot of jazz, blues and electronica but I call this Musak (aural wallpaper). Spend your money instead on Glide by New York Eletric Piano or the new Metheny Mehldau album."
1,Only worth the bin.,"This shoddy DVD should have been released under an unofficial banner so that the fans could avoid it. It's misleading. How can anybody say this is well worth the money for christs sake, when there is so so much missing? There is only one word for it and that's crap."
1,Unfinished,"Perhaps it's unfair of me to rate this book, since I didn't make it to the end. It was disappointing, since I've liked others of Coover's books. This one is written in a stream of consciousness style reminiscent of James Joyce/""Ulysses"" (which I liked a lot). Similarly, it also is incredibly literate and erudite, lots of language play which still somehow was mostly just hard and not fun the way language should and can be. I could appreciate the humor intellectually, but it wasn't really funny. The subject matter is a cynical take on a dark subject, the Rosenberg executions. I can certainly understand why its release was so contoversial. It might help to know more about the period but as someone who came of political age (later) during the Watergate years I know little about Nixon as VP and many of the social references were lost on me."
1,"Does the job, no bells or whistles though","Nice fan but i was expecting better but for the price it,s ok"
1,"Ugh, hated the story -but good acting","The acting was good-the story was not. It was depressing, strange, and uninteresting. I like dpressing and strange, but not when it's combined with a bad story. I think some people might enjoy it in their own way-I just can't recommend it though. The stars are for the acting."
1,WORST Audio I Have EVER Heard !!,"Don't waste your time! The audio is muffled - at best. Even the interviews are of poor audio quality. I've seen ELO live, twice, and they are far, far better than this cheesey DVD. Fortunately, they are on tour again (Fall 2001) - so perhaps a good DVD production is just around the corner. The other reviews contained in this section appear to be biased. Save your money - you do not want to own this DVD."
1,Lord of the Rings,"I loved the books and the movie. However, the quality of the VHS tape I received from Amazon.com was terrible. Near the beginning and several times while playing there was a great deal of ""snow"" and glitches which made it appear to be a cut-and-paste or used version. When I attempted to view the movie a second time it was ""ejected"" from the VCR. I tried it with another VCR and it was ""ejected"" again. This video version was a complete waste of $$$$. I will purchase this video a second time from another source."
1,Like to be Frustrated?,"I am studying Shaolin Kung Fu and thought that it would be nice to complement my studies with T'ai Chi.The difficulty of following this tape is really dissapointing. Everything that you are looking at is opposite of what you need to execute. In other words, if Dunn turns left and tells you to turn left, since you are looking at a ""mirror"" image, it is very straining to execute the movement. If the tape had shown some of the instruction from another angle I would have given this tape a big thumbs up. Nevertheless, if you are not concerned about following the instruction due to the reasons I mentioned above then you might be able to get quite a bit out of this.The reason I gave it two stars is because the quality of the production was exemplary.Personally, I am looking for another source. Good luck, and MORE CHI!"
1,Another Disappointment,"Grisham is off on another political tirade. He starts off developing a decent plot and then abandons it. He gets off on an anti-Vietnam crusade extolling the virtues of running off to Canada. He focuses on his relationship with a matriarch which, again, diverts from the story line. He treats the solving of final crimes as an afterthought. Grisham has clearly lost it. Where he once wove a tale that meshed from beginning to end, he now appears on an ego trip to stuff his political predjuces down the readers throat at the expense of whatever plot he initiated. I was also disappointed with The King Of Torts for many of the same reasons. This was the last book by him that I shall read."
1,DVD problem,"The DVD has a glitch in it. It Won't play all the way thru.You may want to avoid any hassles on this one, hopefully disneywill iron this wrinkle out for the future!"
1,"Mac users love American Heritage, too.","I'd love to be able to review this CD-ROM, but you didn't make it clear on your website that it's only for Windows users. So I'll be returning it to you, along with my request for a Mac edition; after all, it would be nice to be able to boot up the world's best CD-ROM dictionary on the world's best computer."
1,"Well, THIS was a waste of money!","Horrid, horrid toy! It tips at the slightest movement of water, then fills with water, then sinks. It has been nothing but a source of frustration for our son! I love Fisher-Price, but this toy is NOT up to their usual standards. Oh, yes, it is well-made, in that my son has thrown it at the tub wall a kablillion times and it hasn't shown the slightest sign of falling to pieces, but it honestly needs to be sent back to the drawing board for a little redesign. The only redeeming aspects are:1) Sturdy2) Little People can be used in other scenarios (Little People or otherwise)3) Nifty purple Hippo float DOES workUnfortunately, these just don't make it worth the price, in my opinion."
1,Want to buy but won't,"I bought seasons 1 and 2 and was looking forward to buying season 3 but now i will not. Splitting one season into two volumes is ridiculous, especially for a soap opera! And no extras! You lost my $. Will NOT buy."
1,Poor substitute for the Real Manual. Don't bother.,"This Quick Reference is a poor substitute for the real Reference Manual. The publishers suggestion is that you study from the real Reference Manual, and then use this ""quick reference"" to work problems and take the exam. That's a very poor idea. Once you know a reference book, stick with it.One significant shortcoming of this book is that it is not ""tabbed"" like the real Reference Manual, so trying to find the section you're looking for takes longer than finding it in the comprehensive manual. Bottom line is that this Quick Refernce is nothing more than a list of formulas, and it will not be much help on the exam. I think the reason the publisher put this book together was for an ""add-on"" sale or for people who wouldn't shell out for the real manual. You need the real manual... skip this one.See my review under the Reference Manual for recommendations from someone who just took the exam."
1,doggie costume,The picture makes the costume look better than what it is. It is poorly made because it does not fit the dog properly. the neck is too short and the little hat/hood cant stay up and the supposed dragon tail is way too short. My dog is only 3lbs and it was still to big for the costume
1,Disappointed,"Most uninteresting; in fact, it is the first book in a long time that I threw out--waste of money. I thought it would be a good read about L.A. in today's world, but could never get interested. Too simplistic writing--short choppy sentences. Sorry, but wish you luck in the future!"
1,Effective if you apply it several times... but then not a great or lasting color,I had seen several bad reviews here about it not applying well. I tried using it every week for ongoing facial hair and I also found that it was not applying well. It would take 2 or 3 applications in order to be even. Then it would not look very much like true color but would have a bland look to it. I tried for a few weeks and gave up on it. It was taking too much time and not looking like I wanted it to when I was done. I can't recommend it.
1,WRONG,"I got this for a straight razor, and as others have noted, the canvas is too course and the leather is of poor grain and quality. But this tool is also heavy, akward and entirly too wide for a straight razor. This might be the right strop if you wanted to do a poor job sharpening an axe"
1,Navy Brat Should be Titled Navy Bad,"This series of books was originally published in the early 90's and probably should have been left alone after that initial publication. From the first, the outcome of this book was predictable. But, what could have been an interesting change-of-heart story; turned into a series of whining sessions. The lead female doesn't deserve her male counterpart. Her character continuously sings the sorry tune of self pity. She was truly obnoxious. By the end of the book, I wanted the Lieutenant to marry ANYBODY else. This book gets two stars for the subplots and the the perfect Lieutenant. I was disappointed with this book. Debbie Maccomber usually delivers better stories."
1,Check out my review for The Best of the Early Years,"I have just about the same thing to say about this album as I do for The Best of the Early Years (Not ""Then:""). BMG is just releasing half-a**ed discs to wring out some more money from the Giants. This album gets its second star simply for the fact that it's a collection of good songs. Severe Tire Damage is the way to go. Listen to the other reviewers."
1,this is fake paco xs,this is fake paco xs . the bottle and sticker is not the real one!! smell right but doesn't last long. very up set to order
1,Beware! Bogus Disc,"Do not buy any jewel case version of this game. Especially the ones which say you can download a PDF version of the manual from [...]. The application thinks the disc is pirated and refuses to run. I even downloaded the latest patch. No luck. I'm not accusing anyone of piracy but something went wrong in the pressing of the CD. Also, what I got was a CD not a DVD."
1,I spent more money to see this film then they did to film it,"William Shakespeare must have been turning over in his grave after what they did to his popular tale. I have never been a fan of Romeo and Juliet (I think Hamlet is much better) but even I know the butchering of a classic play when I see one. Leonardo and Claire are good actors, and in this peice of trash they play a modern-day Romeo and Juliet. Even though it is set in the nineties, they still stick to the original script, even though half of it is cut for the sake of those who get tired of Shakespeare, (why they get tired of him, I don't know).Now I know that Hollywood has had some pretty bad follies before, but this film is beyond the area in which I draw the line. They should be ashamed of themselves. If you have to watch a version of ROMEO AND JULIET I'd highly reccomend either WEST SIDE STORY or the Franco Zefferelli version."
1,Be Careful - this item is not rechargable!!!!,... that this was a rechargable product. It is NOT rechargable and you are tethered to the AC power supply which has a very short cord. I am very disappointed ...!!
1,didnt watch after the 1st episode,"I know everything on HBO is far better than anything else on TV. I figured extras would also be great. I was disappointed.I only watched the 1st episode but didnt think it was worth paying for the rest of the season.there was a few good jokes and im sure there are many rabid fans of the show, but I think it wasnt up to HBO levels."
1,Creative Zen V Plus,I had two of these MP3 players and both worked very well for a year or so. Then one of the MP3 players started to shut off for no reason and now it doesnt work. I had anther player and it worked well until one day when I plugged it into the computer. It said firmware error and was stuck on that screen. I tried to fix the problem but to no avail. Other reviews said the player stops after a year and I guess they are correct. I have two other Creative MP3 players and I really enjoy them. I hope they do not have the same problems as this product.
1,Very Basic,"This would be good for beginners, but a little too basic for me. He's a little bit too cheesy for me."
1,Waste of Time,This is the worse movie that I have seen. There is nothing funny about it. I am a Dana Carvey fan but watching this movie was a waste of time ... I suggest you take a nap instead.
1,1 star too many,"this movie stinks. im doing it a real favour by giving it one star.there is nothing good i think to say.If these actors werent stars they would never make another movie after this, as it is its one of those star movies where they obviously enjoy winking to camera and putting on wigs, but they should keep these home videos to themselves."
1,The Title says it all,"This book is definitely only for complete idiots. There is absolutely nothing of any interest in this book. THey are stories with huge, necessary chunks cut out. And this is all not to mention the grammatical, spelling, and factual errors that you'll be able to find on every other page. If you know nothing about wrestling, then this is the book for you. But If you've been watching for at least 6 months, then there is no point in wasting your money on this book."
1,Don't waste your money.,I purchased one and it did not do any better than the old magnet style. The electrical sensor always went off in the high setting. I wanted to use it on heavier wall texture. It might work better on smooth walls.I found the studs better the old fashion way. Hitting the wall with my hand until it was solid.
1,Some good info,"Good informational book, however it's written by someone who does not have ADHD. I found the majority of the information overwhelming and hard to implement by someone who actually does have ADHD."
1,A real let-down,"Thurbon's book got me very excited when I found it in the bookstore (sorry Amazon) as I had recently decided that I needed to know much more about the region than I did. After reading it, I have to say that Thurbon's book seems to follow a predictable pattern - Thurbon has his main point, which is that Siberia is a rotten place, and he finds locals to prove his point over and over again in a depressing manner. It doesn't seem to do justice to the region, nor is it very informative."
1,Do Not Buy,"This battery not only has 1/3 the capacity of the OEM battery, but it doesn't even fit in the phone! Seriously, the battery is too think or somehow not made right so the battery door won't close properly. I was very disappointed. To be fair, I did not try to return this to the company because I sanded the edges of the battery in a vain attempt to make it fit."
1,Confused in USA,"The incredible noises and colours in this film make it tricky to follow at times to say the least. Yet I do believe that Goddard was sucessful in achieving his goal presuming that it was to combine completely irrational cinematographic sounds and images with relavant political tensions very typical of the era. There is the strong influence coming from French fascination for all that is American. I would recommend this film to those allready accquainted with Goddard's work as without concentration, it would be very hard to follow, if not impossible otherwise."
1,mad abut you vidio,DVD VidioThis was not the complete first year. skipped over their courtship and hunting for an apartment.
1,More meditative than expected...,"I take the blame here for not spending hours of research on my next exercise DVD, but I wanted to share my experience anyhow, in case someone else is doing their research. This DVD is highly meditative in nature, and while I don't discount it's benefits, i was looking for something different. One of my favorite DVDs is Ellen Barrett's Superslim down Yoga/Pilates blend, and I was hoping for something similar. I wanted something less ""Denise Austin"", and I saw these rave reviews, so I went with it. But it is the other end of the spectrum- too slow and quiet for me. Ellen is the perfect blend- in between."
1,Not what I anticipated,I was really disappointed in this movie. I was expecting something much better. I will definitely be reselling this one.
1,Disappointed,"After reading the reviews of this CD, it is clear that while it does contain music from the movie, it DOES NOT contain the music in the movie. With out these review I would have wasted my money. I find it interesting that the official description of the CD leaves out this fact."
1,Awful fit,"This is my first review ever. I've always felt that Russell athletics made quality workout clothes at a good price, until those sweatpants! These are by far the worse fitting sweatpants I've ever tried, unless you tie them around your neck and stick your arms out of the pockets I can't imagine them fitting anyone properly."
1,Didn't work well,"Only time I used it for exercise, it registered my resting pulse at 202. I could not get it to function, although it did well when I was at rest. I returned it. Hopefully the next generation of these will function better."
1,Not worth the price!!,"I bought this swing after reading all the nice reviews on various websites. The first time I bought it, the product did not work. I had to return and get another one. My daughter barely used it since she did not like it that much. I then packed it away so I could use it for my next child. When I unpacked it after the birth of my second daughter, I found that the aquarium on the side had started leaking. The fluid is all oily and the whole swing is covered in that. Also, when I put in new batteries, it did not work.Overall, I have had a very bad experience with this swing!!"
1,arrived broken 2X,This scooter arrived with the wiring harness broken. I called amazon and they sent out a replacement immediately.2nd scooter had the wiring harness broken again in the same location! ( no it was not the same one)VERY poor design.
1,"Balls are mislabeled - this is actually a 65cm, that's marked as 75","These balls are excellent. I use one at work as a chair and was buying another for exercise at home. Very good product, but my low rating is due to the fact that Amazon apparently received a batch of balls that are mislabeled. I have 65cm Go Fit balls at home and this 75cm is exactly the same size. My 75cm Go Fit that I have at work is noticeably larger.I've returned this ball once and Amazon (as they always do) gave me excellent customer service and sent out a replacement. Regrettably, the replacement is also a 65cm marked as 75cm."
1,I am not satisfied with the seller,"the blender did not seem new, their sound is strange since the week I hurt, unfortunately I can not return it by the purchase from Venezuela. seemed a rebuilt machine. Kitchen Aid is an excellent brand mixers I have 4 of this brand and first brought this problem. I think it was because the seller was not the original box"
1,new age hooey,"This book came highly recommended from several sources and had a lot of buzz. It turned out to be a lot of meandering new age hooey. The writing was pedstrian, the plotting was not much either. Thumbs Down."
1,Better Luck Next Time,"Diana's CD is boring and totally forgetable. All the songs sound the same with the noisy guitars in the background. The only good song is the remake of ""Don't Cry Outloud."" Diana has no pizzazz at all and that's why she didn't win American Idol. She would be more successful singing to a group of senior citizens at a nursing home."
1,"Read ""Nightmare"" by Lukas instead!","I agree with the ""pointless"" review here, but want to suggest starting with the incredible Anthony Lukas book ""Nightmare"" before Emery. THE LUKAS BOOK IS SIMPLY THE BEST INTRODUCTORY BOOK ON WATERGATE EVER WRITTEN. For those who seek a deeper understanding after Lukas, turn to Kutler.This book is horribly conceived, organized, and written. It is a travesty that any hungry student should swallow this tripe when much better books are out there!"
1,more imperialist US propaganda,"If you think the US is the best country on Earth, is ""the home of the free and the land of the brave"" and all that [stuff], you'll love this 2 hours of propaganda.""Yes, the US should defeat the evil Japanase (and Germans) so *WE* can control the world. And to prove how honorable we are, we'll even let our Indians help us, whom we've been massacreing, cheating, and discriminating against for five hundred years.""After this film, your next neo-fascist imperial-America homework is to watch ""Bad Company"", ""Black Hawk Down"", ""Sum of All Fears"", and Brad Pitt's recent ""Spy Game."""
1,Really Bad,"This movie might have been funny back in the early to mid-90s when this type of humor was common. This movie seemed to compete with the Wayne's World films, Chris Farley films, and other SNL inspired characters and rolls. This movie weighs heavily on both the physical humor and verbal humor from the actors. Paulie Shore has some funny lines but not his best work. An honest effort but the movie falls short of any real chemistry in humor, acting, and screenplay writing. If you have nothing better to do, you could always watch this."
1,Maigret,"So-so, not very atmospheric, cases rather typical. Acting good but lacks the texture of the novels. Soewhat disappointing. Would not purchase more of the series."
1,Jawbone,"This headset is bulky, and the sound is not clear. The button is hard to push, which makes it painful to your ear. I do not recommend."
1,S sandwhich,"This is a terrible movie. The dodgeball film Ben Stiller did was much more palatable, which isn't saying much. They've taken three of the most over exposed actors, two of which aren't even really actors, and given them a horrible vehicle. The veritable avalanche of Jack Black and Ben Stiller projects is begining to taste like so many doses of castor oil. It's begining to resemble the Will Ferrel syndrome; please make it stop. The Tom Cruise ""cussing jewish producer guy"" was so over sold that when I watched his performance I was just left scratching my head. The same can be said for the black face Robert Downey; it's funny that he's wearing an afro wig and lowered his voice a few octaves? I don't get it. I'd rather watch 'Kelley's Heros' for the 20th time."
1,Broke within 1 month,"I had problems with this machine almost from the start.First started malfunctioning within the first month, by the 2nd month stopped working entirely.It started with it shuting off the dvd in the middle of it playing and ended when it shut down a dvd and then makes a little noise and there is no response to any buttons pushed. Have to hassle with shipping for repairs now. Shipping electronic products may be the problem instead of the product itself I dont know for sure but my past experiences with UPS has been horrific, They seem to go out of their way to try and destroy their shipments."
1,Worst Option,"There are other books in this field that are much better- How to Win Friends..., Conversationally Speaking, anything by Don Gabor. This book looked interesting because of how it breaks down specific situations (talking to people at work, talking to people on the street, etc.). The information in each of those subsections are largely pretty repetitive and not as specific as I thought they would be. The entire tone of the book is not encouraging either, which is tough for someone who is shy. The advice in the section on when to tell a joke is basically ""don't tell jokes unless you are already funny because it will get awkward or you will offend someone."" This may even be solid advice, but it should be phrased more positively for someone who purports to be a communications expert. I'd go with another book on the topic."
1,What a horrible disappointment!,"Before buying this game, I suggest you rent it if possible. Theme Park Rollercoaster is no where near worth the price I paid for it or even 50% off. I was expecting ""real-life"", ""sim"", or ""Rollercoaster Tycoon"" like coaster game, but no. This was designed for little kids who are capable of keeping track of 30 things at once. For an adult playing this game the cartoon characteristics are annoying. Essentially, I wouldn't pay five dollars for this game. I'm selling mine, you want to buy it?"
1,"beautifully filmed, but boring","I saw the five star rating but was dissapointed, blaa blaa blaa boring. If you listen to the sounds of the ocean in alternative audio mode with your eyes closed this dvd is for you."
1,"Read this and wish you were reading it, While You were Gone","I have enjoyed Sue Miller in the past, but this book just didn't do it for me. While the premise got my interest, the plot is so thinly constructed and the characters so unexceptional, I plowed my way through the book thinking, ""I wish I, too, were gone.""Finally, the resolution is disappointing and one closes the book thinking, ""What a dissatisfying ending to a dissatisfying book."""
1,I love the comics; I love the movie; I don't love the game,"The game is fairly short and easy. That would have been okay if not for the horrible camera. When fighting the Green Goblin I found myself constantly fiddling with the shoulder buttons and analog sticks in order to get a decent camera angle. Also, there were not enough bad guys to populate the large environments. Its not much fun when a building or train station contains only two or three guys to fight. If you're a big spidey fan, consider renting it. Don't buy it. You'd be better off spending 20$ on a PSone Spidey game."
1,Looks Like a Student Film,"Ridiculously bad movie. Looks like it was shot with a camcorder, badly lit, grainy visuals, grotesquely amateurish acting, laughable fight sequences. Save your money.If you want to watch a GOOD movie about doppelgangers, try Invasion of the Body Snatchers."
1,Do you call it MUSIC?,Please give me a break. Little girls maybe can love this CD. This CD is not for adults or people understand about music. If you buy this crap you will be sorry. Damn I was hoping for something better!!!!!
1,I miss the old Brian,"I did not purchase the CD but listened to the samples, so this isn't an altogether fair review. After listening to the samples, I was happy for Brian that he can still churn out some fun songs, however, the voice is no longer appealing to me and I won't be spending any money on the albums. I miss the Beach Boys sound from the 60's and 70's and will continue to enjoy that era's music. I feel a bit guilty for abandoning the contemporary Brian's music, but people and times change and we sometimes only want to visit the past. However, he is to be praised for what he's given to popular music and the sweet memories he's provided."
1,It's Not Brain Surgery,"You do need to do some research before you buy mutual funds but you don't need an overly long, extremely boring book to do it. You can quickly and easily narrow your choices by going to personal finance magazine web sites and the sites run by large mutual fund companies."
1,Beware: this is actually a Joo Ricardo solo album.,"When Secos e Molhados split in 1974, founder member Joo Ricardo said: ""I am Secos e Molhados, so the group will go on."" Instead, he began an ill-fated solo career. It was only much later that he decided to bring the group back with different line-ups. None of them recaptured the group's original appeal, though. But his old statement that ""he is"" Secos e Molhados has taken a new meaning since he began to release solo albums under the group's name. This is one of them. It is NOT a greatest hits compilation! And not an album I would recommend very strongly either, except to completists."
1,Unreliable,"Let me add my voice to those who think this is a wonderful light that often does not work. I have 3 of them and the two newest, the silver ones, will not turn on reliably. How this can continue in this product is beyond me. One person talks in a review about holding the light up to another light to get it started. I need to use mine when I wake up at night and my wife is asleep. The point is that I don't want a lot of lights on at that point. So last night, I wanted to read and the light wouldn't come on. Now, in the daylight, when I don't need it, it turns on. A very disappointing product."
1,"Bad metal, easily breaks.","I learned too late that the construction of this machine involved some kind of really cheap pot metal or similar. It wasn't more than two weeks of use when I went to cinch a metal rod into her when the metal holding the two vice pads together SNAPPED simultaneously straight in two on both sides! They were pulled cleanly apart along a perfect vertical line. Steel doesn't do that. Neither does iron. Anyway, it's completely useless now and thank goodness for Amazon's legendary customer service."
1,"Help me if you can, I'm feeling fleeced","Another cynical ploy by the major releasing studios to exploit boomer nostaglia (I'm surprised no one has observed the proximity of the release date of this opus to the holidays...)I already have my copy of the newly remastered ""Help!"". It is airing on the Sundance Channel as of this writing. The cost of my sparkling, letterboxed, uncut copy?25 cents for the blank DVD.You'd think the releasing studio would at least take me out to dinner first, before attempting to bend me over the retail counter.Wake up and smell the incense, folks."
1,Many better books.,Buy Siegel's book instead. Or Lynda's. This one just isn't up to their standards.
1,Have we read this book before?,"While the writing, itself, is witty, I can't say the same for the story. This story of a single New York woman with a gay male best friend and a disappointing love life has been written (and filmed) before with less predictability. I kept waiting to be surprised and never was. You can finish the book in your head 200 pages before Witchel finishes it on paper.Because Witchel has a witty, and often wicked, turn-of-phrase, I'd like to read something else she writes--something with a more original plotline and and more original characters."
1,"too bad, it don't have power","too bad, it don't have power and don't do right the job; I will have to buy another one with more power"
1,Ocean DULL-er Scene,"The first mistake with the title is the word 'modern'. There is nothing new about this music - Ocean Colour Scene are stuck in the sixties and I wish they would stay there. The music is boring with little or no originality. Sadly OCS come from my hometown, a fact I am very ashamed of. I suppose this is what you get from 4 men who consider Paul Weller a musical genius. DO NOT BUY"
1,Already Broken After One Week,"My children are not the type to break their toys because they are too rough with them. That is why I was surprised when after only a week of owning the music instruments there are several instruments that are already broken and can no longer be used to make music. The tambourine (drum part)ripped right away, and the hollow wood instrument cracked and split in two. I would not recommend this product."
1,Not who you would think it is!,"Imago DeiJust a fair warning for those interested in the study of the great Byzantine Orthodox Father, Saint Maximos the Confessor: THIS IS NOT HIM.! Read carefully the book description on the author. He is a contemporary California guru who likes to tinker with motorcycles. Maybe the previous reviewer did find great spiritual enlightenment from this book -- but it is NOT the spiritual enlightenment you will find from the real Saint Maximos the Confessor. INTSEAD, BUY AND READ:Maximus Confessor: Selected Writings (Classics of Western Spirituality)Maximus the Confessor (Early Church Fathers)Cosmic Liturgy: The Universe According to Maximus the Confessor (Communio Books.)"
1,Smoked!,"I bought this yesterday, primarily as a reasonably priced drill sharpener, but the capability to sharpen chisels, scissors, etc. was attractive.The drill bit holder was a bit flimsy and the instructions were useless, but with some fiddling I got it to work.After sharpening about 25 smallish drill bits (< 1/4"") the motor stopped. Dead. I took off the grinding wheel to see if something was dragging and found that the motor, never very strong, was dead. Kaput. Todt. Morte. The shaft could not be turned. Seized up like visegrips on a lead pipe. It's going back for a refund, and nothing more from PlasPlugs for me, thanks."
1,Would never do business with this person again.,"Book was not sent as described. It was claimed that this item was like new, but was anything but! Item had pen marks on many pages. I would never due business with this person again!!"
1,Cha - ching!,"Another lame attempt to line the wallets of Gloria Allerd and two more ""victims"" of Scott. Spend your money on something important...a local womens' shelter, childrens' hospital, Lacie and Conor's memorial fund."
1,Glad I borrowed this from the library..,"and NOT wasted my money on it. It did not disappoint me, however, since I was not expecting much. PF without Waters is simply not PF, period. This CD is a snooze...with no songs deserving a second listen. With Waters, the songs are lyrical and most of them melodical. Without Waters, the songs just wander on and on without direction."
1,Sticky Buttons,"Although this controller was advertised as having a ""tight joystick"", I should have been more skeptical about the button quality. Something was spilled on this controller, making the buttons sticky. I opened the controller to clean it out and found that there was a brown dried liquid (probably coke) on the inside. I was not happy with the quality here. Bad purchase."
1,Stale Popcorn Everytime!,"Every time we tried to make popcorn with it the popcorn always came out stale and was not crispy. We tried different ways of popping with and without the lid, with and without butter but the popcorn was always stale and chewy. If you like stale and chewy popcorn this is for you."
1,Poor quality dialogue,"The dialogue is bad. There may be an interesting story that unfolds over the course of the series, but Episode I was not a particularly good sell for it. I'm going to pass on the rest of the series."
1,do not waste your money,I bought this book as an alternative to Super baby food. What a disappointment. This book gives you recipes which are exact copies of earth's best jarred foods. Nothing new or exiciting. Do yourself a favor and do not waste your money.
1,how to make a fortune with other peoples trash,"This book sucks,,,ok,,ok,,so I have been in the ""junk business"" for over 33 years,,I think most of what anyone does is simply common sense..The info on how to attract sellers to your booth,,put a braided rug under a table,,have a beverage in a ""depression glass pitcher"", offer snacks, like put bonbons out,,,why,,in hot humid weather would you do this??????? get a microphone to announce sales to shoppers??This is insane!! Dont buy this book,,use your head,,if you did buy the book,,dont do anything suggested,,we all sat around at Brimfield this past week and just laughed and shook our heads!"
1,Don't expect Biblical accuracy.,"Because the author the book by the same title attempts to merge the Gospels, he takes the libery of altering the Gospel accounts and adding superfluous dialogue to ""round out the characters"" in a way that is irreverent of Christ and misinterpreting key passages of Scripture. Judas hung himself, he didn't kill himself in a fire! Come on, seriously! This movie has its moments, but the odd ""hallelujah chorus"" after the raising of Lazarus was not appropriate, and inserting Apostle Paul into this is not historically verifiable and a gross exaggeration on the part of the author. If the author had not contradicted what the Bible clearly records as having happened, I may have been more willing to accept his creativity in other areas."
1,Not worth the money,"Actually, I didn't even pay for it. It was issued to me. Hardly used it because of it's odd shape and the lens broke already--rendering the flashlight inoperable.I guess Pelican was thinking you could set this light down and shine it up at your subject. Fine if you like 8000 candlepower glaring in your eyes while you try to work.Biggest con--it's plastic. Plastic breaks, just like mine did. I'm not even real sure what happened. I think one of my kids over-tightened the lens (which is also the on/off mechanism.)If you're like me, when you need light, you NEED light. This one can't be counted on. Buy a Mini-Maglite. Mine still works after almost 20 years."
1,very overrated,wow... young boys who want to have <edited> ...... fascinating stuff. not really. kinda boring.
2,Thanks for nothing.,"Toys R Us, how do you stay in business? You advertise toys and claim to offer them, but when someone wants to go buy one, it isn't in stock in any of the 13 DFW metroplex locations. So I should just order it online and pay $80 in shipping, right? Is that what you are saying? That I shouldn't bother visitng your stores because your stores are not properly stocked. And further more that you are not concerned with the inflated shipping rates and whether or not an ordinary family can afford to pay them. VERY VERY VERY dissapointed."
2,Style Your Own Kids Kints,Very useful book of basic kid knits. Includes a number of patterns and styles that can be incorporated according to preferecne.
2,Exceeded expectations,"It was a gamble ordering this - based on the feedback about the item itself and Airsplat. The plunge paid off. The quality is top notch, tons of extra parts for various gun configurations that you would expect in a kit that's priced twice as much if not more. While it's true that there is no clear instructions to attach the M203, a quick look at the small nuts and bolts and the metal strips in the small polybag pretty much gives one the idea how to go about it. Some reviews also bashed Airsplat, i guess i lucked out, my transaction was seamless. If i were to say something negative, it's the shipping price. Way too high for me, being spoiled by Amazon as a Prime Member with free 2 day shipping."
2,"""I used to come here when this place was a crypt....""","In the sub-sub-genre of religious sleuthing, the protagonist perhaps most recalls Anthony Boucher's Sister Ursula -- if Sister Ursula had been a hard-drinking smoker, pulling no punches with unsatisfactory superiors. Father Brown, of course, would never have behaved like this, while Rabbi Small sighed over the foibles of the goyim.I hope for a film version, with the soundtrack blaring ""This Disco Used to Be a Cute Cathedral""... and wonder why Amazon does not carry the second book, ""The Darkness Did Not"" (which seems to be only available from catholictreasures.com)One caveat... ""Tumblar House"" looks like a vanity publication or the next thing to one, and the accompanying binding is quite poor... especially if, as is likely, the buyer wants to read it repeatedly"
2,brilliantly funny,"She is brilliantly funny.But it's important to realize that people who don't agree aren't necessarily suffering from traumatic sensory deprivation experienced as a child. And it's not a given that only smart people love the dirty, filthy and highly inappropriate humor of Sarah Silverman. People from other cultures might find her to be offensive and childish. Not to mention incredibly stupid. Sometimes I watch TV from other countries and think, ""Wow, this isn't funny. How can they enjoy this?""You know, life is weird, and Sarah points that out very effectively."
2,Quality bag with few minuses,"I have always been one to place my perfectly good computer in a cheap department store off-brand bag. This bag was given to me as a Father's Day present by my kids who were tired (embarrassed) by my ripped old bag. This bag is sturdy, made with thick material and heavy stitching. There are ample pockets and sections. My netbook and my Kindle both fit easily and are protected. The one thing I wish Mobile would have paid more attention to when making this bag is the strap. The strap doesn't match the quality of the rest of the bag. Otherwise, it is great, and I'm sure I will use it for a very long time."
2,flexibility at low cost,"Rough, cloudy times in the economy requires a low cost options.Why pay hundreds dollars for a mp3 player ? This trekstor iBeat extension works well with my 8GB SDHC card and sounds good with provided sennheiser headphones.I just recommend a couple of extra baterries when you go out and enjoy."
2,This method really works,"Don Webb's (and Dr. Flowers') method of research and practice is one of the two most effective methods of magical practice I've encountered in my fifteen years of magical work. This is the method of active engagement with the magical current through research, study and the effort of putting the knowledge into practice. If you're interested in more than armchair theory and the Typhonian current appeals to you, get this book and put it into practice. You will be greatly rewarded for your effort. The methodology detailed in this book will work for any magical current of the reader's interest. This book is currently quite costly on the used market. Hopefully Runa Raven will republish the book so it will be accessible to a greater audience."
2,"Fun and entertaining for dads, and moms","If you are a very serious person and really need to study babies like its your board exams, this might not be the book for you. But if you are looking for fun, easy to read, and yet informative book, this book is great. Tells you how it is. How accurate it is, i guess I will only know when we have the baby. But for dad's who wants a book to read that is not so intimidating, this is it. Only baby book that I can get through painlessly."
2,A Great Read,"I really enjoyed reading this book. It was a sweet & simple story. No real big plot, but just a sweet old fashioned story that you don't find anymore. I enjoyed it being a Thanksgiving themed story, you could almost smell the turkey and stuffing, it was just a fun book to read and reminds you of the whole falling-in-love process....."
2,A Classic!!!,"This is one of the best games I've ever owned. It has a great replay value, and has two free play modes on top of that. Graphics are great, sound is very immersive, and the control is similar to GTA3. The level of detail that was put into this game is exellent, and the cars, though renamed, are from that era and perform realistically. Police in the game will ticket you, arrest you, or try to kill you depending on the crime (running a red light, killing someone, smashing into another car, etc.). You can win many special cars in the ""Free Ride Extreme"" mode that are fun to drive, some top speeds of close to 200 mph, others are bulletproof or fast taxis. The story might remind you of the Godfather, or Goodfellas movies. I would buy this game if you like driving or FPS games."
2,Book Purchase was seamless...very pleased,Bought this book for my book club. It arrived immediately with plenty of time to read it before the end of the month. Good condition (as described!) Seamless transaction! Thanks!
2,Comfortable but poorly sized,"The reefs are very comfortable, but I have wide feet. The ""smoothy"" strap gets folded under itself easily and they're not quick to put on or take off. I am a 10.5, but ordered an 11. I should have bought at least an 11.5 or 12 due to the width of my feet."
2,Big fun in a little package,"My 20 month old daughter loves this toy! It's small size makes it nice and portable for the park, beach or even on holiday in a suitcase.The scoop doesn't work quite as well as I'd hope (it's a little stiff) - so my daughter may have to wait until she's a little older to use that feature of the toy."
2,"Witty, fun historical romance!","As a fan of Jane Austen, I find it difficult to traipse through the ""romance novel"" genre and find comparable works. I hesitate to search under the category for fear of the ever-predictable story lines. But Lynn Kurland writes a very enjoyable book that has you laughing with the characters."
2,A Must for Jeff Bridges Fans,"I'll make this short and sweet. If you enjoyed ""The Big Lebowski"" and want to see a different but equally potent side of Jeff Bridges' acting, buy this movie. It is very suspenseful the first time around, and it is great to watch this movie over again for the comedic elements. The only shortcoming in my opinion is that the ending is too abrupt."
2,?,I think that the Chee or somebody will come and use their powers on Tobias and Jake. I seems that nobody can even imagine that they don't have to kill him or convince him. They could just trap him. Being a dolphin would do him some good.
2,LOVE,"Her make up is pricey but its great! VERY lightweight and it has a cool water feel when you put it on.. cant explain it. Its not cakey. I really love this product as well the compact powder. I also use Mabelinne 24hr super stay and it only $12 and even better as far as staying power. However, it can feel heavier.."
2,It changed my life and way of eating. I am still fit,Fit for life is a great book as it is not a diet. I read it 10 years ago and to this day I recommend it to others. The best thing about Fit for Life is that it teaches you the mechanics of food combination and digestion.
2,Inspirational,"This is the inspirational story of the life of holocaust survivor Dr. Ruth Westheimer. Throughout an early life of adversity, Dr. Ruth keeps on soldering through without a hint of self-pity.At the age of eight, Dr. Ruth was evacuated, with hundreds of other children, from Germany to Switzerland. She lived in an orphanage for Jewish children, and did heavy house-cleaning for half the day and attended school for the other half. She never saw her parents or grandmother again.At 17 Dr. Ruth emigrated to Israel to live on a Kibbutz, where she was exploited. Living in a tent, her job was cleaning full-time, and no one suggested forther schooling. After a year she left the Kibbutz and supported herself in various jobs and attended school.The account of her years in France and her early years in the US is riviting. Dr. Ruth's strong spirit shining through every situation is inspirational."
2,The Best Veggi Sausage Rolls,I use this product to make vegitarian sausage rolls and they are delicious. i also use it to make veggi patties. it has good substance and is a good replacement for meat.I wish i could purchase it in the supermarket for convenience.
2,hi,"this game is not ment for ya stupid fxxk ya homie in the ass mainstreem hoe's. this game is ment for juggalos,axe killaz, and lets not forget juggalets. so all you haterboiz can FXCK OFF!!and um, this game is fun as hell."
2,Stands up to teenage boy,"My son plays trumpet in his high school marching band. He's not the most delicate creature when it comes to handling his possessions. He announced last year that he was required to have this gizmo for holding the music on his trumpet. I was concerned because it looked like fragile plastic, assuming I would be replacing it every month or so. He used it through the heaviest performance season of last year and has begun this new school year with it still intact. I'm impressed! I would recommend this product and would make the same purchase again."
2,Great Collection,This is truly the Ultimate James Bond Collection! I got this for my husband for his birthday and we have been enjoying it ever since... well worth buying!!!
2,Pat on the back!,"Ok, so the explanation for the pairing of these two Doctors doesn't make that much sense. WHO CARES?! This is pure unbridled fun, which Who should always be, and for those of us who like Blake's 7, this one is a real treat. Troughton is always a pleasure, and he elevates every scene he is in. I've never been one to be off put by the Sixth Doctors incarnation, but I admit that his views on the inability to eductae/domesticate an Andrigum was a bit shocking, though totally in line with his portrayal. I was surprised to see Troughton's Doctor share the sentiment. The story really moves along nicely, and the sequence of the Doctors in the restaurant is worth the price of admission. This one is well worth buying."
2,Bought for family for xmas gift,I recently took my children to see the Hobbit and came home to buy the triology that followed. It has been enjoyed by all of us!!
2,Awesome!!!,It was the thought of a blue see-through CD Player that I liked. They are sooo cute!I'm getting my friend one for her birthday so she'll stop asking to borrow mine!!!
2,Their best since Afraid of Sunlight...or ever!!,"Marillion have been my favorite band for the last 15 years, and this CD is nothing short of stunning. I thought Anoraknophobia was OK, with a bit too much filler and .com and Radiation were both disappointing. But Marbles...First, spend the extra money and get the 2 CD version. Ocean Cloud is worth the extra money all by itself. You won't regret it.I won't do a breakdown of each song (you're welcome!), but personal favorites are Invisible Man, Fantastic Place, Ocean Cloud and Neverland. If you've been wondering where Steve Rothery has been, well, he's all over this CD. The guitar in Neverland brings back the goosebumps missing since Brave and AoS.Highly recommended. Marillion were slipping in my eyes the last few recordings, but they hit a Home Run with this one. Good job, boys, and thanks for stopping by to see us. Hope to see you Summer 2005."
2,"Not quite 5 stars, but almost there.","This is an over-all enjoyable album. There aren't that many different styles on here, unless you call ""ballads"" a style (""Sun Never Shines""), but it's still good. Maybe you shouldn't listen to me, because I'm more of a punk fan, but either way you won't regret buying this, even though the tracks are fairly similar, and there isn't a great amount of emotional depth."
2,Awesome!,The day after watching this my husband and I changed how we eat. Awesome to see how people transformed from juicing! Extraordinarily inspirational!
2,"Excellent , unique and memorable music","This super album was recorded in 1979 and released in 1980. I was stationed with James Lee Stanely in Taiwan in 1967-68 while we were in the Air Force. I visited him in Monterey, Ca. in 1979 and he gave me a pre-release tape of ""Midnight Radio."" I have treasure this superior recording for its creative lyrics, great tunes and originality. Easy listening with thoughtful words to reflect on. You will enjoy listening to this recording over and over and find yourself humming and singing the songs for the joy of it. GREAT STUFF."
2,Feel good music :),Great CD and YES I still like CD's! Amazon found the music that is no longer in stores. I didn't want to download it - just doesn't feel the same. Thanks Amazon
2,Just great food!!!,I Love her book. Everything I have cooked from this book was very good and easy to prepare. If you have seen her show her energy and love of food comes out in the dishes. A must have book.
2,FURminator is awesome!!!,"Last year at our veterinarian--the assistant brushed my Basset with a Furminator and I was impressed! The veterinarian said they are nice to have--but that they cost around $50.00!!! I came home & looked on Amazon.com---and there the very same product was for about 1/3 of the cost! VERY SAME PRODUCT Got mine--and then recently I bought one for my niece to use on her shedding pug. She loves it--and our dogs think they are getting special attention! Do it outdoors if possible--the excess fur will be flying no matter where you do it--so be prepared to have less shedding in the house. All it takes is a regular brushing once a every week or two! (It was like my dogs were wearing a ""sweater under a winter coat""---and it helped to cool them off in this hot summer--and the housekeeping is a lot better too!!!)"
2,A Must Have Book for RVing With Dogs,"Great book!! Camping and RVing with Dogs is a timely addition to my ""must-have"" collection of travel guides. Since I take my dog, Lucy, with me whenever I am RVing, I found the information and tips in this book to be invaluable. In addition, the directory of pet-friendly campgrounds finally takes the guesswork out of finding a campground. Chapter 7, ""Coping with Diverse Environments"" gave great information about places I might want to go, but knew nothing about."
2,What is punk?,"Hmmmm, with the exceptions of (wait for it) Green Day and NOFX, there really are no ""punk"" bands around today. Luckily, we can enjoy THE MISFITS!!!!! This is by far their best album, although Static Age is FANTASTIC.....What more can I say? It's THE MISFITS!!!!!!! GET IT OR DIE!!!!!! Oh, and, if you bash Green Day for selling out, don't forget, the misfits sold out too. I was depressed."
2,more IS less,"The Tao te ching is fully expressed is this text AND cd edition. In surrendering one conquers, more is less, these and other concepts are revealed. As an American the Tao brings a peace and clarity I can use in times of chaos."
2,Respirator,"I bought this for my son, who uses it as a prop for photos . . .he is happy with it but he does not use it for its intended purpose so I can't comment on that .. .he chose this one for how it looks."
2,"great brand, not their best product","While you get the convenience of taking just one capsule a day for man vitamins and minerals, this isnt their best product. i suggest taking their super immune blend. you need to take 8 capsules a day, but you get so much more!!! and its super high in antioxidants."
2,superior spiritual writing for the mystically oriented.,"Not all are mystics like Teresa of Avila, nor are all intellectuals like Thomas Aquinas. One is not superior to the other. This writing is for the mystic. Her writing and aided by the translation of E. Allison Peers, is so conversational and written in a down to earth and highly accessible language style. Not written in ivory tower scholarly dialogue, but it is, at the same time, quite lofty.Sr. Teresa is a tour guide through the mansions of prayer with the utmost reverence for our Lord, obedience, and charity for the faith. She gives practical insights to scripture, and how to know what is really from God, and what is from the deceiver. I loved it, and found it highly comforting. I couldn't put it down and took so many notes that I've referred back to. Highly recommended."
2,ALIAS Recriuted,This book like anything that has to do with ALIAS is great. This book is not about the piolet episode. The book is basically about Sydney's life before she gets recruited to SD-6 and 6 months after she gets recruited. It tells you about her first mission. And remember Noah Hicks well they meet for the first time. I great book. I couldn't put it down.
2,so what if I am 19 years old,"Okay, so almost all the reviews and such say the age range for this book is grades 7-10. Well, let me tell you... I am a college sophomore and I loved it. Granted it only takes me about two hours to read, the story is great. I am an avid read of all of Meg Cabot/Jenny Carroll's books. I own All-American Girl, the entire Princess Diaries series, the entire Mediator series, and if I wasn't a broke college student, I would own all of the 1-800-Where-R-You series. I thouroughly enjoy the conversational tone the books are written in. The little bit of action and little bit of romance blends nicely together to create the perfect plot."
2,"Hilarious, wierd, and honest...almost too honest","...a very entertaining, genuine and refreshing read. Most of us have a little voice in our head which tells us not to talk or act when we think of something very funny or outrageous yet completely inappropriate to vocalize or act upon. Well it appears that the voice in Mr. Hawley's head is silent. We can all relate to his poetic tales and images, particularly if one was ever an 8 or 15 year old boy. If Frohes Wandern is truly autobiographical I feel sorry for his parents."
2,twisting suspense,"this was the first piece of writing i`ve read by douglas clegg and i must say i'm defintley going to check out more books by him. owen,the main character had me guessing on every page what he was going to do next. even the epilouge suprised me. douglas clegg is a true master at suspense. exclent novella."
2,This CD features the gales with their greastest lead singer,"This golden gospel classic is worth its weight in gold. Back when the sensational nightingales were known as the four knights, they had the hottest lead singer in the country...bar none. This was the hard driving Rev. Julius Cheeks. He never got his just dues, o but listen to these classic that someone ,thank God saved. Listen and be enriched. Throw your head back and listen and then listen some more. This CD is in my top 10. It is a must have, no excuse..get this CD and be blessed."
2,Great songs,"When I found the songs on Youtube, I found out that these songs were groovy to the beat of the chipmunks."
2,hot and ready in no time,"This expresso machine met all of my expectations. It steams milk readily, heats up quickly, and presses water thru the coffee in a manner that leaves plenty of creme, while making a strong expresso. It's quiet and easy to master. I think it's as good as some higher end models. so far no complaints"
2,Buy it,"""Launch"" is outstanding. I don't know if a better action genre music track has ever beeen made."
2,THE PRINCES AND THE FROG,THIS MOVIE IS ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES DISNEY HAS EVER MADE. IT KEPT ME & MY WIFE INTERESTED FROM START TO FINISH. I WOULD DEFINITLY RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE TO WHO -EVER WANTS TO KEEP THE FAMILY INTERESTED THROUGH-OUT AN EVENING OF ENTERTAINMENT.
2,Fun Fun Fun,"This heli is a blast. Takes a bit to figure out how to control, but once you got it, you'll be charging it over and over again and anticipating your next flight. The battery lasts exactly as long as my attention span (4-6 minutes). I liked it so much, I went out and bought the Air Hogs REFLEX. It's even more fun (but costs almost $40 more)."
2,A Great Sourcebook,"I am a documentary photographer, specializing in endangered historic buildings. Having explored New England for a number of years, I am in the process of moving to Charlotte, NC.This book will be the starting point for my work in the south. It is well organized, with sites listed by counties and there are clear maps. The book is detailed, with a good basic history of the area at the beginning. A particularly nice feature is the notation as to whether a site is private, open to the public or may just be viewed from the highway. I also own the Guide to the Historic Architecture of Western North Carolina and find it equally valuable."
2,Hello Kitty Unbrella,"This is a very pretty umbrella, so girlie! It does not fold up or collapse into a smaller size like a Totes umbrella. It folds down nicely enough but is still long and old-fashioned like. It opens up fairly big - just right for a 5 year old girl to carry and keep dry under in a rainstorm. We haven't yet gotten to try it out in the rain, but the quality of the fabric is pretty good, and I doubt the colors will bleed when wet. If it does I will certainly update this review. I think it's worth what we paid for it and my 5 year old was really very happy Santa had left it for her under the tree. It was the first thing she went for."
2,A rare read indeed.,"In an area that seems to be covered by every type of ""expert"" Brad Schreiber's ""What Are You Laughing At"" is a rare find indeed. The book offers numerous insights into writing for any genere from stage to screen to personal letters. The book is an invaluable tool for the comedian in all of us whether you want to be a professional comedian, comedy writer or just want to add some solid humor to your next business meeting this book is a must."
2,Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs,"Well, the Dinosaurs are supposedly extinct, except beneath the ice. A nice film for kids and family! I enjoyed it very much!"
2,Absolutely a must own CD,"The first time I heard this album, I thought it was a greatest hits album because I'd never heard of BNL. I was hooked immediately and I've heard them live and they are just as great live as in the studio."
2,Jolly Good,This type of entertainment is typically not my cup of tea. Yet I find myself wanting to give each episode a go as soon as it is available.
2,perfect book for my needs,This book should be required reading as we all need to set boundaries in our lives and this book tells us how.
2,Marketing intelligence everyone should use,Rogers and Peppers have provided the ultimate framework to build a new way for your company to do business. Any customer-centric organization should have this book on hand.
2,Water Pik,"This item works very good, I have never had my teeth so clean, arrived promptly and all pieces, very nice."
2,I liked your book alot it seem just like me when I moved .,It seem to be a unhappy story but in away it turned my life around. I think you should write alot more book then what you have out now.I had alot of my friends to read this one book and they all seemed to like it to.You put alot of things in your books that people have done befor.The Unheard Voice is a really good book.I think everyonr should pick it up and read it just one time and they will see that it hurts when people makes fun of you. And if I was the person in your book I would not take what some people did to her I would have to say something to them not just stand there.I think people should be alot more kinder to people. That just the way I see things about it. I hope know one gets mad for what I say but I think it is the truth. Well have to go fo now. Alisha
2,WORLDS MOST PERFECT COFFEE MUG (For Me),"Due to my daily routine, my needs might be a little different than some. I make my coffee at 4am, clip this mug to my backpack, and begin my work day at 6am. When I get to my desk, my coffee is still piping hot and stays hot down to the last drop around 8 or so. Left closed, this mug is capable of keeping coffee at a drinkable temperature for a good 6-7 hours. As stated, I travel with this thing clipped to my backpack so I needed a mug that was 100% leak proof. This one fits the bill! I also like the 360 degree drink top. No more fumbling around in the dark for the little hole and then miss and spill coffee down your front. Though this mug doesn't necessarily fit well in drink holders, it is fairly stable and does not tip easily. In all, I believe the designers at Thermos designed a coffee mug especially for me. When you purchase one, as I recommend, I hope you love it as much as I love mine."
2,Very nicely made - should have bought the 50' version though,Very well made. Does exactly what it is supposed to ....my only complaint it that I should have bought the longer (50') version.
2,Means What It Says,"I've owned this book for years and I go back and read it quite often. It is a fascinating book! Some find it offensive because it does include manipulation of others, but as the title says, its the art of seduction. Its not about getting *warm fuzzies*. The book uses multiple examples of historical figures that have used the techniques discussed in this book. I highly recommend this book, it is logical, informative, and to-the-point."
2,"Sick, twisted, and FUN!","What a great choice for a rental for this weekend!When Saw was released, it got mixed reviews. My newspaper gave it the ""bomb"" rating.The movie's about this killer kidnapping people and making them play 99% impossible puzzles. When a guy named Adam and a doctor get kidnapped, they need to solve the mystery.This movie is gory, disturbing, and just plain fun. Lots of plot twists that will make you keep guessing! Bring on Saw 2!"
2,The Duke at his best,Good quality DVD. Purchased as a gift for a die-hard John Wayne fan.Thank goodness I read a Review that suggested only purchasing authentic collectors edition DVD
2,paul mitchel super skinny,perfect for after your blow out Super Skinny smooths my hair and gives it a nice shine. I have tried others but still find it works the best.
2,just lovely,"It's a fat little book with powerful black and white images anda few words on each page. What can I say? It's achingly honest,beautiful and private. Josh delivers a message -- a story -- withoutextraneous frills and empty lyricism. Each page delivers, and thereare no wasted words..."
2,Furmanator does the job.,We have an excessively hairy long haired cat. This product does an outstanding job of cleaning it up.
2,"Truly memorable, but not true to original script.","In this Columbia Tristar version there are great performances by a number of people, from Dick Van Dyke to Ann Margaret to Janet Leigh to the wonderful Paul Lynde (as the father) to make this a lot of fun and though dated never seem to lose its magic. But you should know that this version is not true to the broadway script or songlist. For that amount of accuracy you are better off finding the Hallmark version with Jason Alexander in the Van Dyke role."
2,A Familiar Tale for Cameron Judd Readers,"While Glory River is strikingly similar to his 1996 publication, Passage to Natchez, this is still a page turner. Mr. Judd seems to have a knack for the period (early 1800s) and brings to life an exciting time in American History, with all the color, vilence joy and tragedy of the real thing. In fact, the book is faithful to the history of the Natchez Trace and the surrounding areas. I gave four stars rather than five because the characters, their surroundings, the plot line, etc., do seem in many respects to be duplicates of those in Passage. But it is a great yarn and I recommend it to lovers of historical fiction. I think the other Underhill novels might be a good bet as well. After all, if Jack Higgins can re-work old plots, why not Mr. Judd?"
2,Wanted! NOW!,"Concur with all the praise other reviewers have heaped on this great album. I own the vinyl version but have unfortunately disposed of the equipment to play it with a long time ago.""Night and Day"" alone is worth the price of admission. Paul Desmond just wails all the way there. He is longing for something, maybe the good-old-days. And even though it's uptempo you can feel the nostalgia. Where-oh-where is the original Columbia Records? And what the hell is Sony doing here? Yes, they manufacture excellent products but apparently music is beyond their grasp if they do not see fit to issue this album on CD. So, wake up, Sony! Lots of customers are waiting for this superb record (OK, CD)."
2,First-time visitor who felt like a regular,"Rick Steves'suggestions helped us to get the most out our week in London. From how to get and use a weekly transit pass to pubs and restaurants, we found his examples to be excellent. His philosophy of enjoying anyplace through interaction with local folk is shared by us and made our visit one that continues to enrich us. I just received email from a Londoner we met in Churchill's Pub and we're looking forward to ""tipping a few"" in the future. Buy this book, read it, plan your trip to your needs, and get the most out of this great city..."
2,cordless screwdriver,More powerful than I imagined...It will suit my need well for around the house use...Very easy to store.
2,It's the power of love!,"I bought this as a gift for my husband. He wanted just the 1st Back to the Future; however, I found the trilogy for such a great price I couldn't pass it by. My husband was thrilled. He said he could have passed on the 2nd movie but the 1st and 3rd are great. Now my kids get to see all three and we have really enjoyed watching the movies together as a family. I was disappointed with the 2nd movie as well because of the amount of language in a PG movie. But overall I would say that we are very pleased with the Trilogy."
2,Psycho Collector's Edition is Super Sweet,"I am a total Psycho fan and often watch the movie just to fall asleep to. So, when I finally got the movie on dvd I was freakin out because of the over an hour of bonus features which was all behind the scenes of the movie stuff. Very cool and might I add that Janet Lee was one very cool and very down to earth actress."
2,The True American Idol Ever!!!,This is one CD that I can listen over and over again and still get chills. CLAY Aiken Has a God given Gift He is amazingly talented and very Sexy. For the Person who was negative about Him just to boost Taylor Hicks and His CD there is no need to bash the True American Idol Clay Aiken just to get Your point for Taylor accross. I too Love Taylor I was part of the soul patrol and I do have Under the Radar and while it's ok it pales in any comparison to any of Clays CD's. Buy Measure of A Man and any CD Clay records You won't be sorry. He is amazing.
2,Intriguing and Useful,"The thing I loved most about The Attention Deficit Workplace is its applicability to real-life situations. If your a student or a business person, you will use and benefit from the many lessons and principles from this book."
2,Another 5*'s for A Walk to Remember,"Landon Carter is a most ordinary teenage boy concerned with girls, his own future, his own image, girls, etc. Jamie Sullivan is a minister's daughter without a mother to guide her through the challenges of her teenage years. She dresses funny and is not one of the mainstream kids. Jamie and Landon are an unlikely pair, but they are friends who grow to love and support one another in an extremely sensivite and well written love story. A Walk to Remember promised to make me laugh and to cry. I did both. If you have not read it, it's a wonderful story."
2,Bully tailgate lock,"This was very easy to install, looks decent, and works well. The tailgate latch opens slightly more difficult, I have to pull it more straight up than out and give it a good jerk. I may be able to go adjust it, but it opens fine for me. I would recommend it."
2,Great pictures with precise descriptions.,"I just received this book. One of the better ""Pottery Collectors"" books I've seen. The pictures are wonderful, for easy identification. The descriptions are very precise. Only a very small portion of this book is Lu-Ray Pastels. The rest is of all the other TS&T (Taylor, Smith and Taylor) pottery. The price guides are very comparable to what I've seen of pieces on the market."
2,See clearly underwater for about $25,"These goggles were easy to assemble and are comfortable in the water. Best of all, you can customize eye by eye so the final product matches your prescription."
2,A great story with a greater message.,"This book may be the best of this author's. I'm sorry I didn't read it earlier. Although the familiar Dismas Hardy is not the central figure of this book - you will recognize other central characters from other Lescroart work. I found this book to be very thought-provoking, fair, and unbiased in presenting the reader with a story that could happen in any city (and probably does happen to some extent more often than we wish to think). The reader cannot ignore the depth of fears, prejudices, attitudes, and personal agendas than hinder the progress of race relations in our country. You'll not be able to put the book down until you've read the last word."
2,"Lovely, poignant music","I'm always sad when I listen to this gorgeous disc. Lorraine Hunt-Lieberson died of cancer on July 3, 2006 at her home in Santa Fe, New Mexico at the height of her musical and expressive powers, aged only 52. Only a few years previously, she had nursed her sister through her final illness with the same disease.Ironically, in 2000 Hunt-Lieberson had sung one of these cantatas in a semi-staged performance directed by Peter Sellars. In Cantata BWV 82, Ich Habe Genug (""I Have Enough""), she was wearing a flimsy hospital gown and thick woolen socks, her face contorted with pain and yearning, portrayed a terminally ill patient who, no longer able to endure treatments, wants to let go and be comforted by Jesus.I can't imagine a more fitting memorial for this wonderful musician than these utterly moving performances."
2,THE BEST BATMAN MOVIE!,"This is my favorite Batman movie, The Penguin isn't as interesting and entertaining as The Joker but every scene in which Catwoman and Batman are together is great, especially the mistletoe lines. This movie is darker and more serious than the first Batman movie, I'm waiting for the guys at WB to release some kind of Special Edition, because I bought the first Batman movie and it's extra-free nothing, not even the trailers, only dated biographical pages for you to read about the main people involved in the movie. I sure hope for Burton to come back with Michael Keaton and do one more Batman, probably with Michael Keaton kind of realizing that he's getting old for the job but will have to wear the black cape one more time against his ultimate foe! Ha, ha, ha, I know that that's not gonna happen, but hey one can always dream."
2,Works just fine for me.,Works just fine for me. - Works just fine for me. - Works just fine for me.Works just fine for me.
2,A powerful tale of a miserable life.,"I read one review in which the reader said it flat out stunk. I ask why, because it was a tale of misery or because you actually thought it was bad? This was a wonderfully written book about the life of an Irish Catholic boy. If you thought it stunk simply because it's true, than you must not know a marvelous read when you see one. Another reviewer said the sexual exploit at the end lost them. This was a story of his life and Frank McCourt can't simply leave instances of his life out because it may offend."
2,Great Shimano Sora Cassette Gears,"I ordered this 12-13-14-15-16-17-19-21T 8 speed Shimano Sora, and it is great so far for my biking level of my road bike. I use the gears 12-14T at the most with a cadence of about 90-100 RPM and I can go for about 36-40 MPH speed on the flat and downhill. For the uphill with a grade of about 5 to 8 degrees, I use 15-19T gears. I rarely use 21T gear, only when there is a big uphill like around 10 degrees. I am very happy with this compact gears. I have a triple Sora Shimano crankset of 30-42-52T in the front of my road racing bike. Most of the time I use 42-52T front gears with 80-100 RPM cadence. I rarely use 30T front gear only for big uphill. This compact cassette gears are smooth in changing gears. It is compatible for both 8 speed of any bike such as road bikes and mountain bikes. I use this for my 24 speed road bike, 3 front gears of 30-42-52T x multiply by back 12-13-14-15-16-17-19-21T = 24 speeds."
2,We love Georgie!,"Quick and easy download, my daughters favorite curious George movie!Lots of great songs and overall a great holiday movie"
2,Preston & Child do it AGAIN!!!,"Once again these two powerful authors have proven that they are closing in on the summit of thier genre. These two have woven an intricate story and opened up an interesting period of Native American history as well. Congrats are in order, let us pray they keep up the good work."
2,brings it all together,"Purchased these at the same time as Samsung 46"". These cables are great. They get the job done. Price was incredible."
2,Pretty good,"I like the idea of these, but I found a pair made by Adidas at Dicks Sporting Goods that were a lot nicer(and cheaper too). These weren't as comfortable as the Adidas pair either, but the idea is great especially if you have dry cracked feet as I do often."
2,One of the few kitchen items that I don't mind having only one use!,"I try to not fill up my kitchen with items that can't have multiple uses. But there are those few tools that so well do their job that they make it all the more worth it.I've boughten two of these. And the only reason I got a second was because one time I was making boiled eggs with my grandma, I pulled this out and put it in the pot and she was so impressed I let her have mine and went back out later to get myself a replacement. This is great since unlike the count-down timers, it takes into account the temperature of the egg in the boiling water, and for how long.If you don't want your boiled eggs over cooked, this is the way to go!"
2,Yes its great,"This is the book I wish I had as an undergrad. I only purchased the book out of curiosity but was delighted with its content. If you are new to *nix programming then this book is a must! If this book demonstrates anything it reveals the true strength of Unix -- timeless. After all, the book was published in 1984. I always judge a technical book by its cover and this book is no exception (the less flashy the cover, the better the content). Eventually you'll need this book so you might as well buy it now."
2,Great Moisturizer,I was using an alpha hydroxy product (that kept my skin clear and beautiful) for sensitive skin and it was discontinued. I tried products from other lines that broke my skin out with a rash and acne. I have been searching for a couple of years now and have finally found a decently price product that does not irritate my skin and break my skin out. My skin is gradually getting better every week and those little bumps under the skin from other harsh products are going away.
2,Fantastic!!!,"Elaine Stritch. I've been a fan of hers since she did a sit-com over here called Two's Company with Donald Sinden way back when.This is fan-bloody-tastic. It's funny, poignant, raucous, outrageous and so honest at times that it sends a chill down your spine. And she can sing too.I recommend the Ethel Merman section to anyone who appreciates a good story, perfectly delivered.In October she's coming to London for 40 performances at the Old Vic. I can't wait!"
2,georgia flag,"This just what I was looking for, came in good shape, and on time. Thank you for the great service."
2,Cokin P026 Warm 81A Filter,"Add warmth to light and a pleasant tan to your photo. In general, they suppress blue casts on overcast days and on subjects lit by blue sky. These filters correspond to the Wratten Series 81 (81 A, B, C) and complement the Cokin blue filters (023, 024, and 025) which create cooler or bluer tones.Helpful hints : Do not combine these with other color filters as this will destroy the subtle effects. But you can combine them with optical effects filters, including Pastels, Dreams, Star, Speed, etc."
2,Outstanding,"This story had me spellbound throughout. I loved the relationships-old, new and possibles. The characters are believable and the situations are riveting. James Patterson at his best."
2,highly original and entertaining,"i purchased this item for my three year old this christmas somewhat reluctantly as i did not find the trailers appealing, but since my daughter went on about it so much i gave in. iwas wrong , what an entertaining film. Both my 3 year old and 1 year old keep asking me to put it on again. in my opinion its as good as toy story, and monsters inc."
2,"Feel The Love, People","This is deeply spiritual music that, if listened to mindfully and honestly, can open hearts and bring peace and brotherhood to everyone, regardless of ethnicity and opinion and personality. Unlike rap, this is not the kind of music that causes dissension and partisanship and petty, bickering personal resentments. As evidenced by the reviews below, listening to this beautiful, profound music causes one to see things under the aspect of eternity and realize that we are all one within the endless void of being. Fused into one mind through contemplation of these divine melodies and harmonies, we finally grasp that the chains of Maya that seem to bind us to eternal strife are but an illusion and that it's all about the love.THAT'S why everyone reviewing this CD is so mellow and cool with everyone else here.And no need for anyone to ""get a life"" because there's no life for anyone to ""get"" after all. Life just IS, man.Dig, man?Groovy."
2,Gotta love this cd,"When I went out and bought this cd it was after I heard the song ""Lovefool"" off the Romeo and Juliet Soundtrack. Surprisingly I found ""Lovefool"" was the worst song on this album. If you like light, refreshing, and energetic pop music, I would highly recommend this album. Nina's vocals sound excellent with the Cardigans' style of music. Favorite songs of mine include ""Losers"" and ""Never Recover."" Please send feedback to me if you agree or disagree with me."
2,baleful beasts and eerie creatures,i have loved this book sense i was in the 7th grade so glad to be able to read it again now that i am almost 50 the stories are much different then when i was young but they are still great i would recomend this to any one who love horror like i doBaleful Beasts and Eerie Creatures
2,Portable and worth,The product is portable and useful if you intend to use it over short out of town trips.Not recomended for people who are used to gas hobs as it takes around 60% extra time compared to Gas hobs.Use flat bottom pots for optimal use.
2,An inside look at the unraveling of a young woman's mind...,"It was slow-going at the start, but became very engaging as I delved further into the novel. The unraveling of Hannah's mind is chronicled with flashbacks from her childhood through the present. A worthwhile read..."
2,FUNNY!,The British duo Flanders and Swann recorded on their two trips to the US in the late 60s and early 70s (?) amaze and enchant with charming and witty music hall songs. Great for kids because of the animals in the songs and even better for adults. Literate humor that doesn't look down on its subjects. Priceless.
2,I love it,And Then Were None by Agata Christie - I love it. One of the best book written by A. Christie. Will read again:)
2,Karaoke Thomas,"For fans of the Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends series, HIT Entertainment brings you a DVD of pure train action, including eight sing-along songs and two stories.SONGS:SoundsEmilySurprisesA World Around YouDeterminationPatience is a VirtueOde to GordonEngine Roll CallSTORIES:Thomas and the TubaThomas and the Firework DisplayThe songs and stories are all from Season Eight, for those keeping “track”, and are shown as music videos, complete with bouncing puffs of steam for those kiddie karaoke sessions.As is the case with many Thomas DVDs, some editions are packaged with a model train and some aren’t. This one does not include the model train, but does have some bonus features.If there’s a Thomas fan in your house you’ll need to get this one, but it’s not recommended as a first buy for newbies.Amanda Richards, June 2, 2006"
2,Cocoa Body Butter,"""Soulmates Dissipate"" is an exceptional piece of art by a talented author, Mary B. Morrison. This striking novel will thrill you from beginning to end and leave you with tricks for the bedroom. Rub your body down with Jada's secret weapon, the Cocoa Body Butter and keep it tight for Wellington with the the ""Ben Wa Balls.""~LeBlanc author of ""Characters of Lust"""
2,wealth of information,"I've been pleased with the book and find it an excellent companion for bible reading and study. It does fall short in one regard, to-wit: it does not include many words found only in the inter-covenantal books, or so called Apocrypha, which are included in the original Authorized Version. Denominationalism aside, I would love to see the author address this issue with the same degree of thoroughness, perhaps in a follow-up volume."
2,Great Summer Read!,"For fans of the Pendergast books by Preston and Child,this is a must read. It wraps up the unofficial ""Diogenes Trilogy"" begun in ""Brimstone"". The story climaxes on a cliff by the sea and takes Constance, Pendergast's ward, to a whole new level. While it can be read as a stand alone novel, you should really read ""Dance of Death"" first. Its a great summer read with intricate escapes, international flight, games of ""cat and mouse"" and a look into Diogenes' lair, as well as Pendergast's psyche. Its not ""War and Peace"", but it will keep you frantically turning the pages while sitting on that beach!"
2,James and the Giant Peach,"James and the Giant Peach is a funny and nerve racking book that you can't stop reading. This story is for all genders, and ages 10 and up.James and the Giant Peach is about a little boy named James, whose parents died, and now lives with his wicked aunts. One day, someone suspicious gives him a bag of green things to make something spectacular, but James accidentally loses them, and all of them disappear. Suddenly, a gigantic peach grows from an old, dead, tree, which will bring James to anywhere away from his nasty aunts. On his way, he meets some unexpected guests. Some of them are help James, and some of them are very unpleasant. How is he going to get away? Find out if you read James and the Giant Peach."
2,Overall excellent performances,"This CD has been around for a long time. When you listen to the performances you would really be surprised how good they are, especially the overture to Flotow's Martha. But the Rossini Barber of Seville and Mozart Magic Flute are also outstanding. The rest are all good if not great. You get nine performances for less than the cost of a value meal. It is still available at the Amazon Marketplace. I would buy it before it disappears."
2,Easy to sing along with and not torture.,Many kids music CD's lead to crazy parents. This one is actually fun to listen and sing along with. I have found myself singing some of the songs when doing chores around the house! We have had this for almost 3 years now. Great for singing and putting songs to daily activities.
2,Excellent Unit History,"Another superb publication by Fedorowicz, this one a translation of the unit histories of the 9th and 10th SS Panzer Divisions. Well translated and very readable, this book covers some of the most interesting battles of World War II: Russia in early 1944, Normandy, Arnhem, the Ardennes, and the final battles on the eastern front in Hungary and Pomerania. There is also a section covering the 502nd SS Heavy Panzer Batallion in the battles in and around Berlin. Highly recommended for those interested in German WWII history and/or tank warfare."
2,better quality filter,verry good quality filter. I have bought many from stores and this is the best I have came across. Very durable
2,a good fun read,"I first came across Dr. Shahi's interesting ideas on biobusiness when I heard him speak at a conference a few months ago. His presentation created a bit of a buzz. In subsequent discussions, several attendees strongly recommended this book.I found ""BioBusiness in Asia"" to be very readable and well-structured to engage the general reader even though it is clearly organized for educational use (each chapter starts with a Summary and ends with Key Points).At the same time, the book is quite original with sometimes quirky anecdotes, memorable analyses, and intriguing insights. These include, among many others, the so-called ""BioBusiness Landscape"" and Dr. Shahi's perspective on the ""Innovation Development Pipeline"".A good read for both the novice and the industry savvy, as well as those who want to understand how we might go about translating the potential of biobusiness into practical reality."
2,Why Do Leaves Change Color?,This is a question every elementary child asks their parent or teacher. Don't know the answer? Read this cute book and you will find out! A great book to teach one science concept of fall. Do leaf rubbings of leaves collected on a walk and you and your child will have a great afternoon of learning. Excellent text and pictures.
2,The Big C,Love this for the characters and the content about a woman dealing with a life sentence from cancer from melanoma
2,The continueing saga of Anita Blake,"As a long time reader of Ms. Hamilton, I appreciate the opportunity to obtain books that are now hard to find in book stores."
2,"My ""roots"" have finally been uncovered!!!","In reading this book, I have had many of my questions answered. I was very impressed with Mrs. Ferrell's journey into the black woman's past and the struggle to realize how beautiful we really are. I want to express my gratitude to Mrs. Ferrell for giving me the insight on how to enhance my natural beauty and to help me stop being a ""hair abuser"". Being overseas, in a military community, where natural hairdressers are virtually null and void, this book has helped me care and style for my hair in the privacy of my home with minimal cost."
2,"Excellent results, another Hensperger hit!","I, too, was hesitant about buying this book, based on previous reviews I had read here. I own almost all of her books, and they all have fantastic recipes, instructions, and information. I decided to go with her past successes and asked for this book for Christmas. I have used 3 or 4 recipes so far, and each one has come out perfectly. I did not have to make any adjustments at all; the ingredients were right on. There is a wealth of information in this book, definitely the best book I have seen on bread machine baking. I have had not-so-great success with bread machine cookbooks by other authors. This book has everything you need to know on this subject, and then some. Also included are tempting recipes for jams, preserves, butters, spreads, etc., plus creative ways to use leftover bread. I highly recommend this book, whether you are beginning or experienced at bread machine baking."
2,Interesting Read,"I probably would not have picked this up, except. 1. The authors. I lived in Boston when Ray Flynn was mayor and I am married to someone from his home neighborhood of South Boston. Robin Moore wrote the French Connection. I couldn't resist. 2. The library I work for owns it.Having said that, I enjoyed it. I know the places in Massachusetts that were referred to. Buzzards Bay, Fall River, etc. I'm not Catholic, so I need my Catholic friends and in-laws to fill in certain things for me. I can't judge it from a religious point of view, but from the fact that I knew the locations and was entertained. It was very funny in places. Tragic at the end, though I expected Pope Bill to die, even before he got sick in Africa. An interesting touch of the common man, making it to the top. I also knew that Ambassador Flynn used this to say what he REALLY felt about, the President, the State Department. The names were barely changed to protect the ""innocent."""
2,Grip like CRAZY .!!,"Best nails I have found to hold OSB on wall panels. No need too use 2 3/8 "" nails when 2"" does the trick, and cheaper too.."
2,Terrific results - poor quality item,"I'd give the caruso five stars...if my unit didn't die every six months! I've tried cleaning the unit as someone had suggested, but it's definitely dead. When I plugged the unit in for the last time, I heard a ""popping"" sound and it would no longer steam. I used it almost every day.This is my fourth unit and I am looking into other brands. I have zero luck with regular electric rollers - my hair is super fine and long, and nothing else works! I am completely sold on steam rollers, but need something that will last!At the very least I have four units worth of rollers to use with my next purchase."
2,The definitive reference work on flow,"This book is quite possibly the most comprehensive reference book on flow cytometry available. Every aspect of a modern cytometer is covered in depth, including the underlying physics and all their practical consequences to the functioning of the machine. While the incredible wealth of information may make this book unsuitable as an introductory manual to the novice, it is indispensable in any lab that uses this technique on a regular basis."
2,Great CD.,I'm a child of the 70's and enjoy hard rock now and again. I enjoy Kutless and like this CD of theirs.
2,KitchenAid Porcelain Aluminum Nonstick 18-by-10-Inch Griddle,"Bought this for our Glass cooktop stove and it is perfect. We have other KitchenAid pots and pans and they have always been great - this met our expectations. It heats evenly, looks great and cleans up very easily (no no stick spray ever needed!)."
2,Mario Bros.,We got this as our first Ds game for Christmas one year. there are 8 worlds to conquer with individual places to win to move on the the next to conquer that 'world'. anyway it's a pretty fun game for boys and girls and maybe adults too. pretty fun game.
2,Good Data,THIS BOOK SHOULD BE READ BY ALL FAMILY DOCTORS> The book contains information on how Gluten effects the body in ways other than just the intestenal tract.
2,VERY cute,"this video is sooo cute if you don't like the videos where they sing then don't go for this but if you do then this is the best offer. the twins are adorable and they sing songs such as ""i am the cute one "" and ""brother for sale"". my favorite song is ""identical twins"" because they look so sweet. if you love watching the twins when they are young then this video is a definate MUST!"
2,Great Book,"I read this book when my children were small and found it very helpful. I bought it again, this time as a gift for my daughter who recently had a child - and who is planning on teaching music to children as well. So I thought it was very appropriate."
2,Maiden....They Never Stop,"This is a album any Maiden or Metal fan MUST have. Not only does it have some great guitar solos but they mix it up with slow synthesizers and then on to heavy full on Maiden. Dream of Mirrors is a great 10 minute song with slow and fast paced riffs. If your just starting to be a Maiden fan, or just like to get there CD's this is the one to get."
2,Great Game For Girls Ages 5 to 8,"My five year old daughter bought this game with some of her birthday money about 2 months ago. It's a great game, interesting, fun, and easy enough for the younger kids to navigate and play without parental help. It's a combination of simple games and decorating fun, and in each game you can choose different clothes for Kelly and friends, it's perfect for the younger girls. It is also fun and interesting enough for her two older sisters to play (they are 7 and 10), although the 10 year old does get bored with it faster than the younger ones do."
2,GTA but BETTER,"This game is pretty much like GTA, same sort of graphics, same way driving, same way shooting...but the the better part is the fighting and how u can threaten people on the streets and scare them instead of just killing them. This pretty much follows ""The Godfather"" movie story line. For example Luca Brossi dies and Micheal leaves to Sicily. One can create there on MOB face in the game which is really cool. Then you get accepted in the Corleone family, and even get to talk to the DON himself. Unlike other games if your doing a mission with some character to help you, that character doesn't die and kills people instead of just standing there. My favorite mission is when your with Sonny taking over one of the enemy families warehouse. The game is just great and amazing...go and buy it."
2,My Little Pink Friend,"This was the first ""vibe"" I bought. And did I choose well!This product does exactly what it says. It hits your g-spot.My only complaint, is that after a few months of use, the knob that controls the speed begins to rattle and slip on/off.It was a great buy for the money!"
2,My New Best Friend!,A toast to my new wine opener! It opens wine bottles in seconds. Just lever the arm in one direction to remove the cork from the bottle and reverse the arm in the opposite direction to release the cork from the worm screw. I'd definitely recommend this product to others.
2,Another Gong Li and Zhang Yimou success,"This film follows a couple's life from pre-communist era through the Cultural Revolution - a span of 3 decades. It shows us how these political upheavals affected the lives of the average person and what their daily life was like. The film delivers the powerful message of having to endure whatever life throws at you in a masterful way. Fine performances by Gong Li and Ge You. As usual, wonderful storyline and cinematography by Zhang Yimou (Raise the Red Lantern and Curse of the Golden Flower)."
2,I enjoyed it,"Saw movie for the cast in it. Took me awhile to talk myself into it but I'm glad I did.Its not a great movie but 3 1/2 stars. So just sit back, relax and enjoy. And watchsome of your high school memories come back."
2,Ancient Chants,I have had the wonderful opportunity to sing several of Hildegard's works. Hearing these canticles reminded me of how wonderful they are. This is a beautiful recording.
2,Insightful,"Truly a wonderful piece of ancient literature. A must-read for anyone interested in studying the Socratic method. Simple syntax throughout, which makes for a quick read. Does bring new arguments on samsara to the forefront. Also very theological in nature."
2,Forgiveness,This was a great book! It showed true forgiveness and what the power of God can do if you will allow him to work through you. Many people would really struggle with forgiving others who deceive them. This was a easy read with a lot of twists and turns that made the book one you could not put down.
2,Book Review,"In the Gravest Extreme by Masad Ayoob is the plain, unvarnished, pull no punches truth about the use of a firearm in one's defense. Even though it's nearly 30 years old, it holds just as true as we speak."
2,"Great storytelling. Nothing good on TV, especially quality.","Old fashioned storytelling in a movie. I recommend all the Catherine Cookson videos or DVD's. They are better (better at keeping you interested) than most Hallmark movies. Of course Masterpiece Theater movies are even better and richer. Hottie Nathaniel Parker is in one of these movies, and other hunkie British men are in the others."
2,Some of the truth about the long walk.,"When I read this book I thought that the book was interesting and at the sametime a little sad. I thought it was sad because my ancestors were the one that had to suffer the hard times through the Long walk. The Soldiers were the one that had no repect for the Navajos. They were the one that would shoot any one that would stop, just because an eldery person had to stop to take a break or a Navajo lady was about to have a baby.I think if some of the Soldiers ever regret what they did to the Navajo's. Even thought they may have just rode the horses along side of the Navajo's that were walking for more then 300 miles. To different places and showing them to they people at Santa Fe. Kit Carson was a mean and hateful guy to the Navajo'sthat is all i have to say about the Long Walk.I hope that it never happen agian, and that the Navajo's fought for us to keep this wonderful and beautful place full of adventure."
2,Wonderful Story!,"This book will make you laugh, cry and take a real look at yourself and your relationship to others and to Jesus Christ. I fell in love with Pastor Rogahn. He covers everything from gossip to sin to nonconformists to making fun of others without sounding as though he's preaching. This would make a great book for teens to study together in youth groups, discussing one of Pastor's topics each week. The author makes you feel as though you're right there in the pastor's library with them arranging the books. This is a wonderful true story of the friendship between a troubled young girl and her pastor. Great book for teens or for anyone who would like a refresher course on what it really means to be a Christian."
2,I'm impressed,I bought this for my wife and never expected the ice cream to taste as good as the store bought. I was wrong. Ice cream in 30 minutes and it's a very tasty and soft. Well worth the buy and hope to make more ice cream soon :)
2,I don't get scared by books...,"... and this is the creepiest book I have ever read. Enough said. Read it, be creeped out, and enjoy the mastery with which Neil Gaiman employs the art of the written word."
2,it's cheap,"The packaging is the worst but the price right. Buy a box of sandwich bags clean all 54 discs and place them in the bags then use the cardboard holds of the box. I loved the Stargate series, and this is a great way of seeing it again. If too young to remember enjoy it."
2,How did all these people get in my room?,"I am a 19-year-old HUGE Sinatra fan (rare enough), and I would consider this CD the soundtrack of my life. ""I've Got a Crush on You"", ""You Make Me Feel So Young"" and ""Where or When"" are perfect, and ""Come Fly With Me"" is awesome. It wasn't the first- or last- of Frank's CDs that I bought, but it is still my favorite. My favorite song (My Way) is missing, but ""My Kind of Town"" is there... and being a Chicago guy, that's good enough for me. And for a real Sinatra fan, he can talk about the ""Bayonne Baccalas"" all he wants. A legend."
2,Honoring Your Values via Gifts and Bequests,"Many estate planners fail to adequately understand a client's personal values and priorities and merely plug into a standardized will and trust setup. This book provides a systematic method for analyzing and implementing needs for personal financial security, gifts to family, and charitable giving. The audience for the book is clearly professional financial planners, but wealthy individuals will find the author's approach helpful."
2,The squeem waist cincher,The squeem waist cincher was GREAT for about three weeks it does exsactly what it says until the wire that supports the squeem started to come out and the other wire broke on the other side and the squeem started To crease in the waist and stretch out turning it into the scream ! i would say if you get this product it's best to buy two of them so you could switch off and it wouldn't damage as fast but for the three weeks that I had it I was very happy I am going to buy it again but this time I'll get two of them
2,"Yes, it IS relaxing","On some nights it's hard for me to relax. This is one of my favorite CDs to listen to help me clear my mind and relax enough to go to sleep. Plus, the music is beautiful."
2,Great thread,I bought an embroidery machine and I wanted some thread. This was expensive thread but what a great collection of embroidery threads it is and you get that great storage box. Very happy with this.
2,good customer service,"I've had the Elph 370Z for nearly two years and I like it quite a bit. Six months after I bought it the LCD screen died. I was able to drop the camera off at Canon in Irvine and within a week it was fixed, free of charge. The photos i have gotten are better than I would have expected from a camera that only uses 22 mm film. The small form factor is the nicest feature."
2,Man of destiny,"Our 16th president could not have avoided greatness. Oh for the likes of him in todays pols. His ability to move people, even his detrackers, into his camp and make them fast friends makes this account of his life a most remarkable story."
2,Overlooked Masterpiece of Nature Writing,"Mary Austin's work is roughly contemporary with John Muir's, although ""The Land of Little Rain"" comes after the publication of Muir's best work. It's been said that Mary Austin's work is the finest nature writing between John Muir's and Aldo Leopold's. I dearly love John Muir's writing, but Mary Austin is the better writer. There is a haunting, mystical quality in this book. At times it reads like beautifully stark poetry, like the landscape she describes. For me it reads like music. I read this after visiting Owens Valley, Death Valley and the valleys and mountains between. For me it was an affirmation of what I felt and sensed there. If you let it, the landscape has a way of burning itself into you, and she describes that very well."
2,"If you love Cole Porter, it's a must",Great value on Amazon. Bought it for my wife. She loves it. That's the best recommendation a husband can give.
2,"A real classic, no doubt","Every Sepultura fan should own this album. It's a true classic despite the bad production. Max Cavelera's vocals, and the fast paced guitars on here will drive you insane. The echoing drums are really good especially on Morbid Visions and War. The Bestial Devastation EP which is also on here has better prodution. It also includes a remake of the song Antichrist turned Anitcop which was recorded live at some time earlier in the bands career. All in all, a must have for anyone who loves moshing and headbanging. Sepultura rules."
2,very good,"the item ts good, I recommend the quality of the product I bought and I liked their quality is excellentlens, its aroma is good."
2,Highly entertaining,"I found Dan Simmon's Hyperion to be an entertaining, thought-provoking and compelling novel. The stories of each of the pilgrims were masterpieces of short fiction in their own right. Although I would recommend this book to any science fiction fan, I give it 4, rather than 5, stars as I found Simmons' writing to be at times over-descriptive and somehow lacking the true can-put-it-down momentum of a master storyteller. Although I am one to appreciate some ambiguity at the end of a novel, I felt like after all the build-up, Simmons owed us more at the end of the story than the obvious compulsion to turn to the next book in the series. With the right ending, I would have been left thinking about the many great themes in the work. Instead, I just found myself feeling empty and disappointed. Nonetheless, I certainly look forward to continuing this series."
2,For Mamiya 645,I bought a used Mamiya 645 with a waistlevel finder and wanted a strap to carry and use as support when shooting. The lugs on the strap matched the fittings on the side of the camera and are very secure. I adjusted the strap length to position the camera and it works perfectly. Just what I wanted.
2,Great movie,Best one since the first movie. This movie has the most overt Christian themes and ideas of the three and has as much action as the first movie. My 8 & 5 year olds absolutely love these movies and I appreciate the fact that I do not have to worry about the content to which they are exposed.
2,Almost as good as the original,"I'll admit, I lost my original stylus while moving my home, so I had to buy a replacement.Pro: This new stylus works just as well, with the added bonus of having a built in ink-pen - that's fantastic.Con: The only negative (and it's only a slight negative), is that the telescoping top doesn't work quite as well as the original. Don't get me wrong, it does telescope and feels great when in the 'long position'. But while in the 'holder', sometimes it doesn't pop-out on the first push. It's more of a slight annoyance than a problem."
2,A great score,"This soundtrack is an absolute joy to listen to. With music that uncannily evokes John Barry's early James Bond scores (especially Goldfinger and You Only Live Twice), Michael Giacchino has created a musical time tunnel capable of transporting listeners to the early nineteen sixties and the heyday of various action adventure series like Peter Gunn, Jonny Quest, the Man From Uncle and Secret Agent/Danger Man. The thought and craft behind each track is evident in the fact that you can remember exactly what part of the movie you were watching and the emotions you experienced when you first heard it. That kind of alchemy between screen action and score is a true rarity. A must have for fans of the wonderful Brad Bird movie."
2,Commander Cuddles,"In spite of being a not-too-friendly droid guy, General Grievous is actually kind of cute in this cartoonish action figure.This Grievous is pretty impressive. The details on him are a bit simple, but work very well. He has absoloutly no trouble standing up (due to his massive feet).Grievous's action feature is a four arm lightsaber attack. Squeeze his legs, and he raises all of his arms, making him look rather intimidating. He has four lightsabers (2 green and 2 blue) that can be put in his hands seperatly, or they can be connected to make 2 double bladed sabers.He also comes with a grappling hook (why is it always a grappling hook?). I don't use it, but it seems to fire pretty well, and Grievious grips it fairly well.Overall, this is a pretty good Grievous figure thats suitible for younger kids, because this fearsome droid general is actually kind of cute."
2,The Journey Continues...,"I liked ""The Order of the Flame"" so much, I bought the PS2 just to play this game. I liked it as much as the first one. The female protagonist (Rynn) is what makes the game. I have played this game several times for the adventure, the involvment, and of course, just to look at Rynn."
2,A child's displacement opens a window into ethnic diversity in Iran,"The story of a little boy from southern Iran whose parents are killed in the Iran-Iraq war, and who eventually ends up in the north where people are ethnically and linguistically different from the area he comes from. The film deals with the ethnic differences inside Iran, racism, and prejudice, as the woman who takes the boy in confronts the hostility of her husband and other villagers. It has the universal theme of how we confront those who are different from us, but in a totally unfamiliar setting which is fascinating in itself. Iran is a multicultural nation with a variety of geographies, languages, and cultures little known to the outside world, and this movie provides a touching glimpse inside as well as sharp social criticism by the director."
2,Plush Elmo,"My son just loves Elmo, and this one is perfect for carrying around and taking to bed with him. Elmo's soft and cuddly, and just the right size for my 15-month old. And while he loves the Tickle Me Elmo, Elmo TMX is just too hard for cuddling!"
2,Just what we wanted,I like the flat grill plates that make grilling sandwiches easy. Removable and easily cleaned. Only problem is an order that comes off when heating. I assume this is because it is new and will improve
2,"Great buy, child's favorite book",We bought this book and take it everywhere we go! Our child has always loved books and reading. This book is very durable and the large pictures and print are perfect for our child. It is by far his favorite. He took it to daycare with him one day and it was the hit toy of the day! We also love First 100 Animals. I highly recommend this book. our child was 15MO when we introduced it to him and 3 months later he still loves it.
2,"Bad title, good movie","The title and cover are bad, but the movie is great! Watch at least the first 20 minutes, then you'll be hooked. In the same family as 'Shaun of the Dead'."
2,Dry and Store is Audiologist recommended,"I have been using Dry n Store for 4 years, always with these Dry-Brik blocks.My audiologist strongly recommended this system to protect my very expensive hearing aids. The Dry-Brik Blocks work perfectly with the unit. Be aware that the timing stripe on the package in no way represents the actual desiccant condition in the block. It is nothing more than a timing device that starts running as soon as the seal is broken, even if the block remains in a sealed container.I have a humidity controlled home, so I leave each block in the unit for three months rather than the recommended two. No problems."
2,"""The conversation raft""","I bought this raft because I often float around the pool on a raft and try to converse with another friend on a raft. It's annoying to have to hold on to the other one. This raft solves that problem! I've only used it a few times so far, so can't say how well it will stand the test of time, but it seems very well made and sturdy enough to withstand ""normal"" wear and tear.If I had to have a negative about it, I'd say that it could be a bit longer, but really doesn't keep it from being a product I'd recommend."
2,great tent,"Gave this to my son for his first birthday. He loves it and so I love it, too. Easy to set up, easy to store and easy to play with. I thought about getting a cheaper one and after reading some reviews I'm glad I went with this one as I think it will last for a long time. Happy baby=happy mommy!"
2,An Accidental Woman,About a year ago I started reading Delinsky's books. This book was very very interesting and had me turning each page.
2,Painting the Sunset,"This legend is based on how the Great Plain Indians were given the colors of the sunset by one of the talented Indians. This book shows how Little Gopher, the Indian that painted the colors of the sunset for his People, remained true to his destiny. Even though he felt like he didn't have a special gift, Little Gopher continued to stay dedicated, until he was guided in the right direction by an old grandfather and young maiden in his Dream-Vision. The overall theme of this legend is that perseverance pays off in the end.This book could be used by teachers to introduce the lesson of how those who are dedicated to a dream or goal can succeed in the end. The plot of the story can be used to demonstrate and teach students how to do story maps. Also, other activities this book can be used for in the classroom are for Literature Circles and Idea Circles."
2,Good Targest and a good value,These are as advertised and are very good value. Not much else to say other than they arrived will packaged and when unrolled they lay reasonably flat.
2,"A new and interesting take on that fantasy ""otherworld""","Rosenberg does an excellent job wafting us right into his interesting ""otherworld"" where fertility godesses live in their retirement and Odin runs a ferry. He identifies a little too much with Ian, I think, and spends just a little too much time on small details, but then again the details add to the richness of the setting, so long as they don't bog you down. All in all, an excellent read, and I'm looking forward to the rest of the books in the series. I hope he can keep up the freshness of the ideas and vitality of the characters better in this series than he did in Guardians of the Flame."
2,Lots of fun,"All of Steele's books are just plain fun and this is no exception. Bizzare of course, but fun. I like his tributes to the greats and his nostaligic treatment of current scifi, ""the good old days of Captain Kirk."" The Elvis Cult is a riot."
2,GOTTA GET THIS ONE!!!,"Some real beliveable fiction in this one!!If you have TBWP films, games & the collectables-buy this book.Very well written-will keep you glued to the pages!!Can only become MORE collectable as time goes by!Just get it from Amazon-the nice people with the nice price!!"
2,Techie's view of this wonderful tool.,I started at a new company which gave a blackberry to all IT staff members. The book really jump started my use of the blackberry and administration of the BES. The book was well-written and thoughtful in its nod the technical audience. I also like the layout of the table of contents: by hack. Kudos to Mr. Mabe!
2,A Wonderful Read,"It has been quite a while since I've read such a fascinating memoir. The life and times of the McCourt family on the lanes of Limerick are wrought with sorrow, yet somehow McCourt has the wherewithall to hold the reader entranced with subtle humor throughout. The follow-up, 'Tis', picks up the story in America, but fails to be as interesting as the first book. Angela's Ashes is a ""must read""."
2,happy camper,"I bought this set for my wife for her birthday. She is a BIG Will and Grace fan. As with any complete season set, the great thing is having all the shows to watch on hand and not have to sit through any commercials. She's a happy camper.Every show makes her laugh, and I must admit that I'm getting into watching it as well. The box set is neatly pacakged and we feel the discs are easy to access from the box. Overall we are very satisfied with this purchase."
2,Fabulous CD,I listen to this symphony while I am creating my mixed media art. It is absolutely beautiful and meaningful to me.
2,Cool Toy!!!,"This toy is sooo cool!When you think of an item in your head and answer yes,no,unknown,or sometimes it eventually figures it out!I was playing it for an 1 hour and it got it right every time.It's amazing how it figures it out and it's great time consuming toy for travel and stuff."
2,Easy to set-up. It works.,"I was a little apprehensive about purchasing a 'do-it-yourself' security system, but I'm worry free now. It's only been a few days, but it seems to work great. It was also extremely easy to setup, and allows for some advanced configurations based on zoning -- still easy to setup. I would highly recommend this product."
2,Inspirational as well as intertaining.,Something for the whole family to watch. A piece of 20th century history. The children and their friend Hugo make you see that everyone has a place and a purpose in our lives.
2,Awesome Product!!!!,"My four year old had trouble learing her alphabet and numbers. We tried games, songs, flashcards, and many other activities and nothing worked. After watching these DVDs for only two weeks she knew all of her letters and the sounds they make. She is also trying to spell small words now. She can count further too. These DVDs are amazing. I only wish I bought them sooner. My 18 month old also watches these DVDs and trys to sing along too. I recommend these to anyone. I also have VOL 1 and they are a great DVD set as well. The two VOL are a great pair."
2,Quiet please,My toddler daughter loves all Patricelli books;)We love them too! Helping us explain quiet Vs loud to our 23 mo old little girl.She wants to read all her Patricelli books beforeBed every night.
2,Required Reading...,"Jim's book is a recount of lifes daily events that we all can relate to but Jim's honesty and retention of detail makes any reader envious of his delivery. I mow my lawn and have dinner partys, embarrass my family and find myself in similar situations as written in his book but Jim's presentation makes even the smallest household chore absolutely hilarious.I advise everyone to read ""Laugh It Off"". Hopefully, he'll write a second edition. Jim's book and weekly newspaper column will bring laughter to anyone.Sincerely, Jim Schaffer"
2,Nice to get back to...,"Like many others here, I dug out this disk from my ever-increasing collection. It's been at least six years since I've last listened to it, and ten since I bought it. I had a tape of it with me on a trip to Prague in 1990, and found it great listening while driving around at night. (There I go getting nostalgic!) Anyway, this disc has not lost any of it's impact with me. I heard and met them a couple of years later at a gig near their hometown of Hershey, PA (*not* Illinois as someone else here commented). So if you're an approaching 30-something and feeling nostalgic, check it out... :)"
2,awesome,"This is a great cd for any music fan and it will be greatly appriciated by hard core newsboys fans as they return to the style of albums like take me leader and step up to the microphone with edgy pop and rock combos. This cd incorperates everything a christian music fan would want, with hard rock tracks like ""Cornelius"" ""Giving it Over"" ""Live in Stereo"" and ""Fad of the Land"". It also has worship with tracks ""Thrive"" ""Million Pieces"" and ""Lord I don't Know"".This cd also has good promise in having some secular hits because you can hear hints of other bands in their music such as Smash Mouth, Lenny Kravitz, and U2. I recommend this album to any rock fan."
2,Favorite Pic,"This is a favorite picture of mine that looks classic in even an inexpensive black frame. Don Quixote represents those who wish to see things as they could be, not as they are right now. It is hopeful and inspirational."
2,American Revolution would have been impossible without it!,"It is difficult to write a review of the Second Treatise of Government in that it is a book whose central ideas so permeate both British and American thought that no review can do it justice.Any student of American history, particularly of the revolution and the formation of the Constitution, out of necessity should read this book. It is a book that the revolutionaries themselves were well acquainted with, and formed the rational basis for justifying both the Revolution and the establishment of the Constitution.Locke is, also, suprisingly easy to read, even today. Cogent, well-formed arguments inform every page of this masterwork. This is a fascinating book that shaped history itself."
2,"Not his best, but a must-read for any fan of Marius Gabriel","Rebecca is recuperating in Nepal after a mountain climbing accident when she learns that Therese, the daughter she gave up for adoption thirteen years ago, is suspected of setting the fire that killed her adoptive mother. She concludes that her best chance of helping Therese is to reappear in her life as a nanny, telling no one her real identity. Rebecca soon realizes that something is not quite right with the entire family. Unfortunately, Marius Gabriel is not at his finest in this book. The first three quarters were excellent, with a fantastic buildup of suspense and intrigue. The ending was a bit of a let-down, and it felt incongruous with respect to the rest of the book."
2,"Life, the Universe and... well... Almost Everything.","Sixteen stories of Life from the tiniest most pervasive virus to the broadest span of all creation. Features the following authors: John Binns (Editor), Trevor Baxendale, David Bailey, John Seavey, Mark Stevens, Ian Farrington, Jonathan Morris, Richard Salter, Kate Orman, Steve Lyons, Matthew Griffiths, Gareth Wigmore, Alexander Leithes, Andrew Campbell, Lance Parkin, Todd Green and Jim Mortimore."
2,A WONDERFUL BOOK TO OWN.,"This is the telling of the French tale of the Juggler of Notre Dame. It has of course been around for a few years now and is quite familiar. The author has adapted this tale with a wonderful text, but the true delight in this book is the author's wonderful illustrations. The care and attention to detail of the illustrations almost overwhelm and take over the actual story. This is a very small volume but it is well worth adding it to your collection. Adults and children will both learn and remember this tale due to the author's skill. Highly recommend this one and suggest you add it to your library, if indeed, you can find a good copy."
2,"If you dig really rockin' rockabilly, this is it!!!","What a fabulous collection of brand new selfpenned rockabilly this is. Hot & cooking, rough and rocking, while staying true to the original 50s sound. What a ball!! - Reviewed by The BlackCat, 2006"
2,A True-to-Life Account,"Though I am a Japanese American born after WWII, I wanted to know what was going through the minds of the Japanese in Japan who decided to bomb Pearl Harbor and get involved in the conflict. This book got me about as close as I could get to talking to someone high up and powerful in the Japanese naval command. The highs, the lows, the delusions, the misconceptions, the hopes, aspirations - they are all clearly laid out. The account of Yamamoto's death and Ugaki's survival is better than an Indiana Jones-tale. The main thing you come away with is this man's patriotism and devotion to a misguided cause. Ugaki and Japan seriously misjudged their strength versus the power and resources of the United States and their allies."
2,Exactly what I wanted,"The shoe fit me well, and it came in the original condition - no damages, and it came on time."
2,"A Wonderful Actress, A Wonderful Writer, A Wonderful Story","In first grade I bought this book at a school book fair. Finally two years later I read the book and was so glad! It's an outstanding book, perfect for girls ages seven to ten. It's about an orphan named Mandy who is very lonely. One day she climbs over the wall of her orphanage and finds a cottage which she makes her own. She learns a lot tending the garden and working at her cottage every day. One day there is a problem. The orphanage is looking for her. When I read that I wondered will she be okay? When I started reading that part I couldn't put it down. Anyone who reads this should really love it..-S.L.B. granddaughter of Barbara Seaman (10 years old)"
2,Good Hooks,These hooks meet their intended purpose. They obviously don't stick to everything - whoever invents a hook that does stick to everything will be rich!
2,Why 4 discs?,"I thought it weird that they supplied me with both the Blu-Ray and the DVDs. But, the picture and sound are amazing."
2,Love it!!,"Denise Austin is always great! She knows how to work the body and get great results. It's called Bootcamp, but it's not like anything I'd imagine would take place at an army bootcamp. But it's still a great workout."
2,Good music,"I bought this CD just for the two songs I had heard before, ""Days"" and ""Goodbye"". I was surprised to find out that I enjoyed many of the other songs. Nice album."
2,Impressed,"I was impressed by the quality of this comforter, especially at this price. The workmanship appears to be excellent and the 700 thread count cover feels like satin. It is hard to imagine any down working its way through. It is quite a bit warmer than my previous comforter and may not do for a 3 season comforter but I will have to see how it goes when the bedroom gets warmer (right now it gets down to the mid 50's).The tag says ""minimum 75% down"" just like every other comforter we saw at Macys and Bloomingdales for President's Day sales. The actual size is 68""x88"", not 90"" as stated in the copy (which makes it the standard size). Overall a great value."
2,Building power supplies.,"This gives you the basics of building power supplies, how they work and a good foundation for future projects. Easy to grasp and use as a learning tool."
2,an excellenet anime/hentai movie!,"this is an excellent anime movie! this is the first anime that i collected! this movie had a very good plot in it! this movie contains lesbian scenes of anime. if you collect anime, put this anime movie in your collection!"
2,Great album...,"50 Cent did great on this album. Em and DRE also did well on producing.I don't know why people are saying he can't rap,he has the hottest flow lately.The best tracks are patiently waiting, many men,high all the time,heat,if i cant,back down,21 questions,gotta make it to heaven,and u not like me.I hope fiddy will be more consistent the next time he releases his next album..."
2,Amazing!,"This book changed my life. It made me look at things in a way I hadn't before. I admire Nicole Krauss for her ability to master point-of-view changes. Immeadiatly after reading the book, which I got from the library, I logged onto Amazon and bought two copies, because I knew that I would want to share the book with others, and give it as a gift :)(it's really that good!)"
2,The Pickwick Papers,"Dickens is hilarious! This is a comical look at high and low society in England in the 1850's. You might recognize some of these characters - they could be your relatives, friends, neighbors - people are still the same. Reading the book on Kindle made it easy to check meanings of words like hosteler, portmanteau, trundle, and vicarage. Follow the wacky adventures of the Pickwickians as they travel through England, managing to live well without doing a lick of work."
2,Emerald Forest Illustration for La Ciudad de las Bestias,"As a teacher of a University in High School course, I was amazed at the ability to use the Emerald Forest as illustration for the story La Ciudad de las Bestias, by Isabel Allende. The customs, living conditions and beliefs of indigenous people of the Amazon (the setting of her story), are helpful in understanding the culture alluded to in the novel. The only problem for use in certain venues might be that it is rated R. The natural magazine/channel display of lack of dress of the natives might make showing of the movie prohibitive in some circumstances."
2,Awesome,"Once again Seal has proven he still has got it. Seal has stayed true to himself and has not conformed to the pop garbage that is out there today. I have been playing this CD over and over. I just love it! I have all his CD's and they are all great. I hope he tours. I had the opportunity to see him in concert a few years ago and it was one of the best shows I have every gone to. His show is very dynamic & powerful. The sound is amazing & Seal is full of energy. If anyone gets a chance, check out this amazing artist!!"
2,A Comeback For Arnold!,"This is the first movie Arnold released after his heart surgery. End of Days will take your breathe away and leave you at the edge of your seat. Get ready for high speed action and thrills! This is one of the best action movies Arnold has ever made. If you loved Eraser and True Lies, then End of Days is the movie to buy and watch over and over. 5 Stars all the way!"
2,Great product,This product worked just like I hoped it would!My Garmin nuvi GPS is stable on the dash andmuch easier to access than on the windshield.It issomewhat bulky but I guess that is necessary in orderto work properly. Very pleased!
2,LOVE this tea,This tea is great! I have been drinking it for at least a year now and never tire of it and nothing else seems to compare. It is great with honey and a splash of milk.
2,Much Better Organized Than His Other Books,Sometimes all of his tonics can get confusing but in this book they are well organized with an index at the back. In chapter two he lists steps one through five of what to apply when. There is a chapter for weeds which helped to me to finally figure out that what we used to call Winter Grass is Annual Bluegrass. He uses a lot of non-standard products like mouthwash and beer. In this book he explains a little bit more about why they work which I really liked. He also talks about the five grass growing regions of the country and the properties of various cool and warm season grasses. I thought he covered the western states better than in the other two books I have from him. All in all I would highly recommend.
2,Perfect for camera,I purchased this for my Sony Cybershot and am very happy with it. It is about as slim as the camera.
2,great dvd product,"I love The Office!! I was definitely excited about getting this product. However, it arrived later to my location than I thought it would arrive. It would have been 100%, if it would not had taken so long to get to my mailbox."
2,Scholarly,"Throughout Human History most people have believed that we are both physical and spiritual beings, that in fact the immaterial part of us can live on even when separated from our bodies by death. The rise of science, however, has called into question the existence of the soul. Concurrent with the demise of dualism has been the rise of advanced medical technologies that have brought to the fore difficult issues at both edges of life.In this careful and thoughtful treatment J. P. Moreland and Scott B. Rae argue that the rise of these problems alongside the demise of Christian dualism is no coincidence. They therefore employ a theological realism to meet these pressing issues and to present a reasonable and biblically accurate depiction of human nature."
2,Brief but helpful,This Chilton guide is not as comprehensive as others we have had but it is still a great tool to keep in the glove compartment.
2,Best x-mas movies of all time: Top 10,"A must have for your collection, It has both the original and the second version of it. Highly recommend, nothing better than getting warm around the holidays and watching this one."
2,Knives like new!,"Great product. Using the metal rod is not very efficient and hard to get really sharp. After a few strokes with this device my JA Henkels knives are like new, easily slices through ripe tomatoes. Highly recommend."
2,Keeps You Guessing,"When Faith Parker wakes from a long accident-induced coma, she has virtually no memory. She doesn't even remember her friend, journalist Dinah Leighton, who visited her every day at the hospital and who has now disappeared. As bits and pieces of Faith's memory gradually return, never mind that they seem to be someone else's memories, it appears that she was helping Dinah with an investigative piece, but the details have been lost. It also appears that someone was banking on Faith never waking up. As attempts are made on her life, she turns to Dinah's fiance for help. But can he be trusted, especially when it becomes apparent that Faith has some sort of psychic connection to the missing Dinah? This is an elegant little thriller with supernatural overtones, and readily recommended."
2,Electrical tape,Its electrical tape. Not much to say. Good adhesion. I use one roll in each of my first aid kits.
2,Great Space Saver,"This bike rack is better than expected. I didn't even bolt it to the wall(I don't have kids), but you have the option. The design works great as a freestanding rack. I highly recomend this product."
2,Got cats? You need this.,"This feeder is great for bird lovers and folks with cats - it keeps our felines entertained all day long (or at least until the seed runs out). In fact I'm back on Amazon tonight looking for another one because it's been such a hit.I'm amazed by how well the suction cups hold. The feeder hasn't budged a bit since we put it up last fall, even when it's full of seed plus half a dozen or so squabbling sparrows. We have not had any trouble with birds running into the window when trying to get to the food.I will say that it took much, much longer than I expected for the birds to find this feeder. We are on the 3rd floor and there's not a lot of cover too close by - but still, it took about six months (and winter months at that!) before we saw our first bird at the feeder. Be patient and they'll discover you eventually, and then you'll be in the same boat we are - constantly running out of sunflower seed."
2,Very cool. Lots of fun.,"Guero sounds pretty much like one would expect Beck to sound at this point in his career; in essence, it sounds like Odelay if Odelay had been made after Sea Change. This isn't a fault against the album; in fact, I appreciate how the maturity demonstrated here doesn't dull the fun. ""Qué Onda Guero"" is a definite highlight, as is the cheerful ""Girl"" and opener ""E-Pro,"" which sounds roughly like Beck channeling Joan Jett--which works much better than it sounds. This isn't the genre-defying masterpiece that was Odelay, nor is it on par with Beck's opus, Sea Change. But it's /good/ music, dammit, and that doesn't come around every day."
2,great classic,"very well done, blue ray of this classic movie. As always arrive promply and I have no complaints with this movie."
2,Bahamas Flyfishing Bible,"This is not only the definitive flyfishing guide to the Bahamas, but also (i) a very insightful book on logistics and non-fishing pursuits on the islands; and (ii) one of the finest fishing guides written for any area in the world, which is an especially great accomplishment given the span of the area. Read to plan, or just read to dream. Essential for anyone deciding on which island to go to, and which areas to fish. My only complaint? -- that I personally wasn't able to help research this book by visiting/fishing all areas covered."
2,Long standing,"I bought this CD years ago and it still remains a constant on my player. Michael Been's lyrics and voice are stirring. Every song on this disc evokes emotion and images that will haunt and inspire you. If you want to buy something that will touch you to the core then invest in this music. This is their strongest product, followed closely by Reconciled."
2,Raving Fans,A Must read for anyone in sales....inside or outside sales...Reminds us of the things that Corporate America has helped us forget!
2,Unbelievable performance/recording,Highly recommended - best recording of the symphonies that I've ever heard yet. Truly captures the essence of Beethoven.
2,Dr. Hook Fans Around the World UNITE!,"Truly one of their best albums, out of so many made by them after 16 years THIS ONE is, was, and always will be one of the best. Comprised of so many wonderfully sung songs by BOTH lead singers. Some would have you believe that only Dennis or only Ray sang the songs. This is false.Cover of the Rolling Stone is a fantastic song, but there are so many other songs they made that were far better than the ones that were their bigtime worldwide hits. Ballad of Lucy Jordan, The Wonderful Soupstone, Carry Me, Carrie, Turn On the World, and Mama, I'll Sing One Song For You. These are a few of the songs that were the true SOUL of Dr. Hook and the Medicine Show. I have over 100+ CDs, 50-some albums, countless cassette tapes, 8-track, reel-to-reel, VHS tapes, DVDs....all of it. Email me to join THE Dr. Hook Fan Club......."
2,"Well written, but a little on the long side","It describes a malfunctining family - in great detail, with great sympathy, great humor, and with a feeling of 'true'.Only problem is it sometimes is too long, with too muc internal deliberation, and too little actual action (for my taste).Undoubtedly a very good book by a very talented writer."
2,Fun and Fabulous at Bedtime,"We received this book on my daughters 1st birthday. She immediately loved it. We sing the book to her as this book easily lends itself to song. In the beginning we pointed to all of the different objects the text refers to: the moon, pink pajamas, blue pajamas and such. After a few readings, she is now pointing to the objects as we sing the book to her. She loves it, and it has made putting her down for bed such an ease. We sing the book two times and then it time for ""night-night."" This book is heartily recommended."
2,"Great market overview, but not thorough on valuation","This was a great purchase for the last 13 chapters, which explain current trends in each sector of the market. The beginning contains a good overview of value investing, but I found that the valuation techniques were not explained thoroughly enough to actually use (the growth and discount rates are sort of pulled from thin air, and these are important). So - it's good for beginners, and it carries the Morningstar name, but you'll later need to move on to more quantitative discussions of valuation."
2,Beautiful Peice,I received this piece as gift. The piece is gorgeous. I have been collecting willow tree figurines and this was a great addition to my collection. Willow Tree Figurines are beautifully handcrafted and will stand the test of time.
2,Thalia - Greatest Hits,"This is an amazing collection of all her videos since she started with EMI. If you are a fan you must have this in your collection, If you are not, you must still have this in your collection as it is one of a kind. Never before had her videos been available to purchase, and this is a great compilation. It would have been even better though if they added also the video for Anastasia that she did for that FOX Animated movie with same name, and videos from her real Beginnings like Un Pacto Entre Los Dos. The previous reviews that were done before the release date have a bit of incorrect information. I did not see anywhere on the DVD a section of the making of the videos as they list, Mujer Latina Remix is not included either. So go out and buy this one of a kind collection of Thalia's Videos, you'll really be glad you did."
2,A fine example of Lindberg's Virtuosity,"It's quite interesting to note how Lindberg's sound changes over the years. If you listen to this recording and then listen to one of his more recent releases, you can hear how his sound has become more refined, crisp and ""tight"".His extreme high register (high F, etc.) also becomes stronger over the years. Just goes to show that even the world's best can still get better. This CD contains great examples of the ""Classic"" Trombone Concertos (that David Cadenza is unbelievable!), and the World Premiere recording of the de Frumerie Concerto is just as good; if not the most exciting piece on the whole album. However, I too noticed some spots where Lindberg's tuning is less than perfect (particularly Grondahl). Nevertheless, Lindberg does incredible justice to each piece he records. Definitely worth your money!"
2,A Must-Read Collection,"Emotional Roller Coaster is a terrific collection of poetry, taking the reader through the ups and downs of life, love, and family. Ms Pagliolo does a wonderful job of putting words together to convey the emotions of life. An excellent read!"
2,Wish it hadn't been cancelled,"I really enjoyed this series and wish it hadn't been cancelled. It is intelligent, funny, sad and often scary. The characters for the most part are interesting and not your usual stereotypical characters. The writing is good. Some of the scariest parts are when average every day people are infected with the ""virus""."
2,good product,"Works well except that the top of the container is somewhat tricky to fit - it snaps on and off the base with some difficulty. But the product is much sturdier than the Blitz Pour N Stor which I used to own - and the top of that device is difficult to close as well, but only when the bin is full and it changes shape because the plastic is thin."
2,Believe the Hype!,"I had read the other positive reviews many times and wasn't sure I wanted to invest the money for this toy. But I finally broke down and bought it along with the G-spot attatchment. All I can say is WOW. To start with, the whole thing was bigger than I had thought from looking at it on-line. The attachment especially was a bit daunting. I took it out of the box and said to myself, ""My God, it's HUGE."" But let me tell you, this bad boy gets the job done. It is hours (or minutes) of fun--depending on how long you have and it delivers in the power department. I love that there are no batteries to replace and even though it lacks in the penetration, let's be honest, most orgasms are clitoral anyway. So plug it up and let the fun begin. Highly reccomended."
2,Unusual,This is really a cool item. It will be a great conversation piece. I will probably collect all of the different styles.
2,Interesting Read,"I thought ""Out of It"" was a very well written book. It shows us what actual hallucinations can be like for the schizophrenic. Obviously the writeris well spoken on what he experienced in the 7 months during which he was delusional."
2,Wonderful and Very detailed book!,This is very informative sewing book. Wonderful and detailed insrtuctions with step by step pictures. I like the book but I'm a novice sewer so it was a little overwhelming for me. But will be an asset when i get better at sewing. A great buy!
2,A Privilege to Read!,"Stephen White has written a very tight and well paced story. The characters, especially Alan, are interesting and compelling right from the beginning. It's clear that the author knows of what he writes, which lends a great air of reality to the whole story. I loved the ending...surprising, action-packed and lots of fun to read.If possible, I'd read this book before White's others just because many of the characters in this novel re-appear throughout the series."
2,Arkansas and the New South: 1847-1920,"A very interesting book! Moneyhon's focuses on the rebuilding of Arkansas' government and economy is very concise. He details the difficult tasks of building an infrastructure to lure industry and commerce to Arkansas. Another area that the book focused on was the begining of the transformation from the slave labor economy to a more modern agricultural and industrial economy. Moneyhon also does a good job of describing the hardships of the countless poor farmers and sharecroppers. The plights of the newly freed slaves are also portrayed in detail. Being from Arkansas, this book not only expanded the stories that I was already familiar with, but also taught me new histories of the state. A ""must read"" if you are interested in the post-Civil War South."
2,easy installation,"easy on, has worked very well, didn't run without it so I don't know if it reduces wind noise but it certainly doesn't add any. Can be flipped around so you don't have the lettering visible."

2,Good Quality Leather Hat - Recommended!,"This Kakadu ""Crushable Leather hat"" looks great, is made from good quality leather, and the sizing is accurate (at least in the XL size). This hat was given to me by my father after my excellentMinnetonka ""Fold Up"" Leather Hatgo missing (he didn't know that I ordered a new one to replace it). I like my Minnetonka hat a little bit more since the rim is somewhat bigger and just looks ""better"" on me, but it is also more expensive.The hat is great for hikers since it can be crushed and reformed after sticking it in a backpack. It is also great in the rain and snow since water does not seem to bother it.Recommended!CFH"
2,My favorite book of all time.,"This book made me appreciate the ability to read! Everything about the book was great -- the brilliant child Ender, his equally brilliant good and evil siblings and their rise to political power via the internet, Ender's adventure game, battle tactics, bullies, buggers ... every page was worth reading. I only wish that the sequels were half as good but they are not even close (IMHO). It was sad to see Ender grow up."
2,Saved by the gov't,I received my book on the same day I had a lecture.It was in good quality and I would certainly purchase from this seller again.
2,Awesome Book for the price,I got this book to get some help with my proteomics experiment and for the price of $4.99 it is well worth it. Tons of important information of students and professors alike.
2,Bridge On the Drina by Ivo Andric,"The way Andric writes, I sometimes forget it is fiction. He is so accurate with historical facts and references that it really is a seamless give and take between writer, facts and story.I love Ivo Andric, and am always on the lookout for his work in English translation. I would someday love to find and read Signs On The Traveled Road, some say is his best work. Of course Bridge On The Drina won him the Nobel prize in literature and reading it now I can see why. Andric is one of those authors I will read and revisit many times in my life."
2,Very nice grinder,"I bought this grinder after careful research of customer reviews on Amazon and other sites. Both I and my husband are very pleased with it. The unit is quiet, grinds very well and according to settings. We are average coffee drinkers, but can feel the big difference in the taste of our coffee now.Before we used Capresso 551.01 model, and it never worked well for us."
2,Intriguing!,"I thought this book was great. I didn't get it at all the first time I read it. After a couple times, though, I really understood it. It really made me grateful for the little things. In the book, there was no color, no feeling, no emotion. It's hard to even imagine.I recommend this book to everyone!"
2,Great Book of Facts. Millenium Edition,"The World Almanac 2000 is 1024 pages of facts and reference information on economy & business, astronomy & calendar, noted personalities, science, internet, computers, states of the U.S., travel, health, nation of the world, sports and more. The World Almanac 2000 provides brief, accurate information on an endless array of subjects. There is also a special section: the 20th century in pictures, an exclusive 16-page feature.I am using The World Almanacs during some last years. For the most information in one source The World Almanac remains the champion. This is one of the most great and useful reference book of facts I know."
2,The only translation I need,"My method of judging a translation of the Tao te Ching is to immediately open to chapter 15 and read. In this case....Alert, like men aware of dangerCourteous like visiting guestsYielding, like ice about to meltSimple, like uncarved blocks of woodCan't get better than that.I am probably in the minority in that I didn't care much for the photos. Seemed uninspiring to me. Hence, 4 stars not 5. Buy for the text."
2,Danser!,"No track listing? I will save you the effort of googling it.(1)Elle Est Là(2)Merde à l'Amour(3)Non Dis Non(4)As-Tu Déjà Aimé(5)Attaque Surprise(6)Je n'Ai Pas Peur(7)On s'Amuse(8)Bonne Anniversaire(9)Poursuite(10)Danser(11)Je Ne Veux Pas(12)EmmanuelleTrust me, they sing better in French than they do in English...listen to the song ""Vive Le Rappinghood"" (a B-Side from one of their singles) & you'll know that perhaps English should not be the universal language.C'est vraiment belle! Groovy Jazzy Funky!"
2,A Very Good Book!,"Though geared for classroom use, it still could be adapted for the homeschool environment.It starts with 2 sample daily schedules that you could use as a guide.Then it actually gives you a calendar for the whole year, unlike most books that don't give a schedule for summer. Each week in the month is assigned a theme with suggested letters and numbers to cover. Then each week is further divided into days that are assigned activities you could stretch further by using the sample daily schedule (given in the beginning of the book). To top it all, it gives reproducibles and suggestions when to use these reproducible crafts during the week. It also specifies their page numbers. If you are a non-proffessional like me, these book will work like a charm! No wasting time waiting for your children to sleep before surfing the internet for crafts."
2,Ageless,"I read Fate Is The Hunter in 1962, when the first paperback edition was published. That was an unforgettable experience for a very young adult fascinated by aviation. I still have the book, with its yellowed and brittle pages.So I decided to order the latest edition in view of re-reading it in ""greater comfort"".It is surprising how little Gann's auto-biography has aged. In fact, it has gained in value as a testimonial of the daily life and occasional tribulations of the first airline aviators.An essential book for those interested in the history of aviation."
2,exactly what I was looking for,Was a perfect fit for the french press I broke. Was the cheapest one I could find on the internet and was shipped quickly!
2,"Better now, but still expensive","I love this TV. Bought it for $1750 (floor model). Had an initial problem with the TV turning itself on and having a frozen screen where we couldn't shut it off unless we unplugged it. We called SHARP and they contacted a local repairman to come out and fix it. I guess this is a common problem with this model. The repairman came out yesterday and said he's already done this ""firmware upgrade"" to 15 others like ours. Hopefully this will solve our problem.Otherwise it's awesome. Great visually and has a lot of options. We're in Indianapolis and are dropping our cable bc with a roof antenna we get our local channels in HD. Looks much better than cable!Only gets 4 stars bc the price is still outrageous on technology is that supposed to be mainstream. Not everyone has $2k to drop on a TV."
2,Can I tell you how much I love this record...?,"A stellar collection of South African pop music from the 1940s and '50s -- probably the best introduction to the ""jive"" style that you can find, and fairly easy to track down. American swing and pop vocal styles are gloriously transmuted into delectable melodic forms -- the perfect thing to put on some day when you're down in the dumps and want to feel really, really warm and fuzzy. This disc features the best artists of the time, the recordings of many of whom are maddeningly impossible to find anywhere else. Especially cool are Miriam Makeba's original vocal ensemble, The Skylarks, and the beautiful pennywhistle music of groups such as the Solven Whistlers. This is a fun, fascinating album, and highly, highly recommended!"
2,tourmaline,Love it. it helps my daughters hair alot.It dryes and strightens all in on. Dont have to use the flat iron as much.
2,This is the voice of reason.,"Ayn Rand applies reason to a variety of significant matters with stunning and convincing effect. A must read for any person who has been raised on pablum in public/private schools and the media and who desires a true, meaningful educational experience.Jim"
2,Dr.Rosedale diet,"It is a revolution this book. I have met Dr.Rosedale in a conference and I have been impressed by what he has communicated about this diet.It is an oppotunity to improve your life, a new point of view."
2,EXCELLENT IN EVERY WAY !!,"When I turned fifty I decided I wanted to learn to tap dance. Every class I signed up for turned out to be too fast, too confused, too advanced, etc. and I became discouraged. Then I discovered BONNIE FRANKLIN'S tape and the quality of the instruction, pace, reinforcement and overall presentation were superior in every way. In a word, Bonnie is SPECTACULAR! She has been tapping since she was nine yrs. old and it really shows. Her ability to present the material at the level a beginner can grasp is nothing short of phenomenal. I play the tape several times a week and have REALLY LEARNED TO TAP !! It is so wonderfully satisfying to succeed at something you really want to do and this tape turned me into a tap-dancer. It is worth every cent I paid for it and I'd gladly pay MORE for another. Bonnie, please make a follow-up tape!"
2,This Movie Rocks!,This show is hillarious. It is textbook Murray. I plan on seeing a thousand times.
2,A helpful book,"I thought this was a good book with excellent advice on how a man should treat his wife. Although this book is old, the advice will never be outdated and be helpful to many. This book helps a man to examine himself and the way he treats women. It addresses issues such as leadership, manners, and communication. It is very important that a man treats his wife well and lets her know that she is loved. This book will help a man do just that. I would recomend this book to men that want to please their wives and do what's best for them."
2,Wonderful characterization,"Wonderful characterization! One would think Ms. Gardam must be a War Years Raj Baby herself. There was not a lot of action, but the reader so inhabits Old Filth (and others) that the page must be turned.False Prophet?"
2,WOW!,"I've seen this video more times than I can count, AND I bought the soundtrack! I NEVER get tired of the music! I saw Les Miz in Toronto in October, and once in Kitchener. I LOVE Philip Quast! He IS Javert! Colm Wilkinson is THE ONLY Valjean, and Micheal Ball rules! If you love Les Miserables, BUY THIS VIDEO!"
2,i am muy feliz !!!!,"This is great. Felicity all for me, and for us. Brilliant!!! Can someone tell us when the other seasons will be released????"
2,Smooth and Thin,"Working in a hospital, I needed a pen that was smooth and fine tip. I like that I can fill in documents quickly and the retractablility of this pen is important and makes the task and paperwork go by quickly. I love that it's refillable because I'm tired of throwing away good pens that dont have refill capacities. I love it so much that I bought the pen in two other colors. It's light and compact. I think I am a lover of this pen for life!"
2,an excellent resource!,This is a great book! I have been in the music business for a long time and the lessons within this thing are some of those that took me forever to learn on my own. Save yourself a few years of pain and read this book!
2,I am a novice in doing this.,"I have always been a Yankee fan. I bought this book and still have it in my collection. It was copywrited in MCMXLVI and it is near ""mint"" condition. It is a hard back copy. I was 22 years old when I purchased it and I am 76 years old now. The book is 54 years old.It is very interesting as it describes his days at the sandlot baseball diamonds until his time when he joined the Yankees. He drove to Florida for spring training with Tony Lazzari and Frank Crosetti. Both Tony and Frank drove and they finally asked Joe to take the wheel and he replied ""I don't drive"". I was at Yankee Stadium when he came back after his heel injury in time to play the Boston Red Socks game and really helped the Yankees win the pennant. It is a very interesting book for anyone to read who is a Yankee fan and followed the life of Joe."
2,Sorting out Germanic Europe's prehistory,"The author presents a sober and reasoned view of a time in which speculation is the norm- or should I say normally runs wild?Schutz writes in his forward that one purpose of the book is to make available a summary of the current state of scholarship which has been largly available only in German.The scope of the subject matter is very large and while an in-depth discussion of all aspects is impossible in a book this size, Schutz does succeed in covering many of the most important steps in the cultural development of central Europe.One important aspect Schutz elaborates on is the cultural continuity found throughout much of central Europe over hundreds of years.Separate sections deal with the lithic, Celtic and Germanic cultures. Although slightly dated, this book is a valuble resource."
2,Good Quality Cable,I've been using Monster cables since I bought my home entertainment components back in 2000. Never had any problems or issues with them. Bought these for a component to component connection for my TV and DVD. No issues. Monster cables on average are a little more expensive than other brands but I'm willing to pay the extra for a pretty much lifetime warrantee.
2,During my time.,"Enjoyed the action and charactors, gives you a feeling of what some of our uniformed service men went through, my brothers-in-laws."
2,Versatile and compact - form and function!,"We got this gate during the summer when our son was about 10 months and starting to walk. He loved trying to climb the stairs in the summer house we rented - we needed a gate but would need something that required zero hardware. Plus, we live in a small apartment, and would have to be able to stow it with ease. This gate fits the bill.We use it now to block all the AV equipment under the TV. I am buying another today to block off the sliding glass door. The little guy can see though and even stick his little fingers everywhere without worry about a pinch.And, it's very reasonably priced, so I don't feel like I'm getting pinched either. Gotta love that."
2,The Best One!,"I have bought several pedometers and have been very disappointed in them.Now, I am completely satisfied with my Omron HJ-112 Digital Pocket Pedometer.I wear it every day and have had no problems with it. It is accurate and so easy to read."
2,straight jacket,It was everything I hoped it would be and more. They should have that book in every prison library.
2,Great fun!,"I look forward to each new show. It is better then The IT Crowd, but if you like The Big Bang Theory You might like the British version."
2,great seat !,This booster is great. The material it is made of grips the chair so it doesn't slide around when the kids get in and out. We have 2 year old twin boys and having 2 highchairs takes up a lot of space. We switched them to these and they have done great at the table. Plus they are super-easy to clean.
2,"Complex, exhausting and fabulous!!","Thank you Ms. Kingsolver for a moving experience. I know this is just a novel, but I was so moved by the characters and the country and the beauty of the writing, that I won't soon forget the Price family or their African experience. I kept calling my sister long-distance to read her something I just couldn't wait to share."
2,can't believe it's not butter,"Man the Slits are great. I can't believe it took me this long to find them. I think i have a new favorite group, the Slits. Their music just talks to me. It makes me wanna take action not just sit on my ... all day. Do yourself a favor and buy this CD."
2,Not your typical alphabet book!,"I work at a public library in the kids' dept., so when I saw another alphabet book I almost passed it by, but the picture on the front of the book of an alligator eating a salad really piqued my curiosity. ""A is for Salad??? What???"" I said, and had to open the book to see what was going on. I didn't just look at a page or two, but had to read through the whole thing - it was just so cute and had me smiling as I figured out what each letter REALLY stands for. Great to get kids thinking while having fun, each picture depicts an animal beginning with the featured letter engaged in some activity. For example, an alligator is eating a salad. There are a few animals, such as the iguana and narwhal, which have helpful clues as to the animals' identities hidden in the pictures. Kids may need help to identify the jellyfish and vulture, though."
2,"This book belongs on any ""wanna-be-a-linguist"" bookshelf!","I very seldom PURCHASE a book for my personal library, but this is one of my favorites! I've shared it with various friends, mono-, bi- and multilingual. We all enjoyed it, but maybe those who speak at least one of the 4 languages covered here will get the true ""delight"" out of this comical, fascinating little work. The reader gets insight into the thought processes of the people groups represented. Just wish it had been a LONGER book."
2,Devil on the Mountain,"Sasquatch Mountain was a great movie with Lance Henriksen and Cerina Vincent. I saw her in the movie ""It waits"" and she was excellent in this one."
2,Poorly packaged - broken dishes on three shipments,We love the dishes but after two shipments with multiple broken dishes I was getting a little annoyed. I filed a mild complaint with Amazon and they let me keep the second shipment with several broken bowls and sent a third set. It was received with various broken plates and bowls but I was able to make a full set from two shipments - and a few spare pieces left over.The dishes themselves are very nice and the mugs are perfect. I like the fact that Pfalzgraff offers a wide range of open stock accessories.Kudos to Amazon for their great customer support.
2,Great Value!,"This was a terrific deal! I wish I could find a larger capacity that isn't ""HC"", so I'll just have to work with more cards."
2,UNBELIEVABLE!,"I went to a youth conference in January and the Swift were there. I had never heard of them before, but I realized I had heard one of their songs on the radio. They led worship and did a concert- they were awesome!! You can tell that they are really men of God and they don't want you to focus on them, but on God. After the conference I knew I had to get their album.My favorites on the CD are Wake Up and Almost There. Wow....All the songs are great though!! I never skip any of them...the band is awesome!!! The lyrics are great and once I got the CD I couldn't stop listening to it...I highly recommend this to anyone!!!!!"
2,Works great for faxes,"I use this to send out a sort of ""fax merge"" to people. It's easy to use and was easy to install."
2,Also works on porcelain sinks!,"I have white porcelain kitchen/laundry room/bathroom sinks. I use this cleaner to remove silver marks left behind by pots and pans, oven racks, etc. Works like a charm! Better than anything else I've tried."
2,Can't get enough. Great CD,"A must have for anyone wanting to succeed in life. You've achieved everything in your life because you at some point thought about it. So you should #1 set your self goals #2 think positive #3 look for diamonds around you #4 do things to achieve your goals everyday #5 treat other people nicelyOne you buy it, you're going to want to listen to it several times and you'll start seeing the world in a positive light.It sure has changed my view on the world.Thanks Earl!"
2,"Piping hot or ice cold, your choice!","This thermos is fantastic. I used to use it to take coffee to work in the morning, and if I forgot to clean it out that night, it was STILL WARM the next morning. That's 24 hours of thermal insulation.Of course, it works just as well for cold. Iced tea, ice water, stays icy cold. Be careful not to put too much ice in, because it won't melt anytime soon, and you'll wind up having only ice with not much to drink.The only drawbacks are size and weight. Its perfect for a road trip, trip to beach etc, but not something you'll want to be lugging around with you while hiking or anything. With this in consideration, you won't be disappointed with its performance. Highly recommended!"
2,Great addition to radeon hd 5450,"My gpu didnt come with a fan, poor thing was running at 69 c too. So i decided it was time to step in. I got this fan mainly for the name behind it. I simply put it in the pci slot next to it, rerouted some power to it, and was up and running. My gpu runs at 40c overclocked now. Im extremely happy with this fan. Do note when placed in the pci slot the intake (where you want the gpu) is on the right side. It also is quite poweful, so as long as it can take in air it will keep your gpu much cooler"
2,Katherine Rule Rules!,"This is an excellent submarine thriller. It was quite refreshing having a female protaganist in an espionage book. This book is not as formula as Tom Clancy and that's a rather good thing. I love submarine thrillers, and this is certainly one of the better ones."
2,Very Pleased,The adapter works great. I can now use my G.P.S. on the boat with no wories of the battery going dead.
2,Great Wedding CD!,"This is a great cd! It has a beautiful celtic sounding version of ""The Wedding Song"",a perfect wedding communion song that can almost give you the chills. I think there are a lot of great choices of songs to use if you are planning a wedding- not comtemporary songs but beautiful, classical, old fashioned music."
2,Sunburnt orange and brown,"In my opinion this is Stevie's most intimate album. There is so much colour and emotion here. It's the nucleus of Stevie's songwriting and musicianship. A MASTERPIECE! (Tuesday Heartbreak.. yeah!!! Looking for another pure love.. yeah!!!)The melodies are so rich and warm they make me think of a summer sunset. I would love to hear this as an instrumental album too.This music feels and breathes. So much emotion. And color... just close your eyes.There is Electric Ladyland, Sgt. Pepper's and Talking Book."
2,"I supporting this ""Baje""!!!!","I am listening to the album and wondering where this girl was hiding!!! Anyway, the album is good and I especially like Music of the Sun but that is the Caribbean in me. Go ahead and get your copy, I know I will."
2,Strongly recommended!,"Another well-written, emotionally-engaging book by Jodi Picoult. Although slow moving in the beginning, the tempo picked up considerably as the story moved forward. Paige was a likeable protagonist, and I related closely to how overwhelmed she felt after the birth of her son, especially with a husband who was so clueless and unsympathetic. Without giving the ending away, I truly appreciated the way the situation played out and resolved itself."
2,Digital camera review,"Great quality and variety of fuctions, but big laps between pictures taken when flashes"
2,Good game,Bought this game Grand Theft Auto IV for my PlayStation 3. it arrived in good condition and I enjoined playing this game.thank you
2,Wow,The movie was really enticing. Loved the scenery and the action. I would recommend this one for all the intrigue and action.
2,Bravo!,"Truly a great movie that you can enjoy over and over again. Acting is beautiful, scenery is just what it sounds like in the book. The only thing I would have like to see is the ending with a little more aniticipation. The sequence of finally finding Mr. Rochester and bringing him a glass of water should have been done with as much tension and anticipation as the rest of the movie. I think had it been 1-2 more segments long like Pride and Prejudice, it would have made all the difference. However, overall I adored this movie."
2,great to work with,Good buy. The item came quickly and as described. Will order from them again. You should definitely order from these guys.
2,blue gender great anime,i purchased this dvd on word of great iternet reviews and liked it on most condtions except for few minor tweaks here is how it rounds. +'s:exclent feautures like special feautures and the bilingual languages also the plot.-'s:just one big problem the animation isn't very well drawn. overall its agood series but make sure you check out the commentary.
2,If only it had had better writers,"An interesting idea and excellent actors. Both Cosby and Culp are good actors when trying to be serious and both can be exceptionally funny.But the show suffered from spotty writing. Some of the stories were really very good, but many were pretty lackluster, and some down right pittiful. It often seemed to have the same plot over and over, just different bad guys.Even the best actors need something to work with.It`s not that the show is bad. Over all it`s quite good. But it could have been so much better with better stories."
2,Long overdue,"I first came into the know about the so called 'Derriere Garde' on Ben Wattenberg's show in 2001. He was highlighting a collective wave of New York based classically trained painters, sculptors, architects and musicians. S De K's music was featured on the show. I purchased this recording in August 2001 and it was like a breath of fresh air to my musically adventurous though sometimes jaded palate. In the meta events that were to unfurl in the following months, this recording was like a sympathetic friend with whom sadness and laughter was shared."
2,Wowzer!,"I loved this book! With it's mixture of fun and fantasy, it was great! Avi agiain worked his wonders for kids of all ages. I read this book for a Social Studies book report. We had to pick a time age to read a book on. I'm really glad that i chose this one!"
2,PRE-MUSICAL,"For those who have seen the Elton John musical, and have had trouble understanding the first act, this movie clearly explains the strife that led Billy to his dancing quest. I would highly recommend this movie to those who have seen the musical."
2,Screw the critic,Screw the critic whatever Phil Collins has done has always been gold! God forbid we hear any decent drums on the radio these days.
2,Great overview of the Prophet Jeremiah,"Extremely well thought out and intersting. This book will give you a greater appreciation for Jeremiah, and how similar society was during his life and today."
2,Great for Summer Spanish,"A simple book for any age that can write and read - a fun way to keep Spanish vocabulary fresh. The only reason for four stars is that there's no phonetic spelling for the new words you may come across. My students do enjoy it, and always are happy to quiz themselves on ""Spanish speed"" with these books during class transition times.Sra. GoseAuthor of Spanish Fun Activity Calendar"
2,A really great film,"I first became a fan of Rhett and Link via the web. I loved their music and humor, so I ordered the movie. I was suprised. It is warm, witty - and deals with some powerful social issues. I really loved the intimacy captured in the interviews, and the sencerity of effection they have for those they come in contact with. You really see not only Rhett and Link's search for Ms. Locklear - their 1st grade teacher, but the unfolding of the cultural issues of a nation of people. A people that Ms. Locklear belongs to - so she is no longer just a teacher, but someone with influence and power to effect the lives of those around her. What starts as a search for a childhood teacher, becomes finding what influneces all of us, and helps us make the moral desicions of our lives, and for our nation."
2,A decent product for $200.,"With some effort I was able to get this machine to work properly and then there was little difference between the crema produced by this machine and that which comes from the $1,200. machines. Its finicky, oddly documented, although the CD that came with it has a series of short movies that was a nice touch. Mostly I was startled that there is no way to release the steam after a shot is made, twice when I tamped too hard, or some other blockage occurred I blew coffee grounds all over the kitchen when I opened the basket holder. That said, once I figured out the right coffee, grind, and tamping, its been pretty good.Would buy it again."
2,A Easy Read for Beginners to Patanjali's Yoga Sutra,"It's all in summary form. Definitely a good beginning for knowledge seekers on Patanjali's Yoga Sutra. As usual Swami Rama have many intersting points correlating the sutras to our daily life activities, such as husband and wife relationship.A must read because it relates to our daily life."
2,Peace of mind,I love the peace of mind I got while using the baby b'air. I felt that my daughter was much safer than if she were just sitting on my lap with out it. We only used it once for a trip to Disney and then sold it on ebay. I am buying another one for my son to use when we go to Disney in the spring. Had I thought we were going to have any more children I would not have gotten rid of it. I was als happy that it is machine washable. My daughter wet through her diaper all over it and me on the way there. I think if you are flying without a car seat this is the next best thing to ensure your child's safety. I won't fly with out it.
2,like the others in the series but,"the main stories a bit short and theres a ""minimoon"" bouns tale and the books seem to be geting smaller but maybe thays just me"
2,excellent toothbrush,"This tooth brush does an excellent job. All my life I had terrible brushing habits and the dentist always said I had bad gums, had to floss and brush. Now I get excellent reviews. No talus build up, very shiny white teeth. I highly recommend this."
2,damn good,"this album surprised me because i only bought it for two songs i heard but after listenig to the whole album it turned up to be very good, i really recommend it."
2,It works awesome!,"I have an older iMac and this Ram along with a OS upgrade rejuvenated my machine. Great product, awesome value!"
2,Great product!,This is a great high quality product and shipped quickly. Very very good deal I would highly recommend to anybody.
2,gOOd,The product and the receiving was in time and Was good...Unfortunately the box has been broken during the package travelling... :-s
2,I'm a Strong Lion too.,"1 minute and 9 seconds of pure Pollard pop bliss. If 'Strong Lion' is the sound of Uncle Bob post-GbV, then all will be well with the world (at least the Indie Rock World, of which he is king). I love the fact that everybody's Fading Captain still gives the 7""/single format his time -- and big thanks to Must Destroy! for providing a 'Compound Eye' warning shot over the bow. Other than the jangly pep of 'I'm a Strong Lion' (is Bob ready to do a Christian rock album?), the single features 2 previously unreleased tracks (demos from 'Universal Truths and Cycles'). 'Breadcrumbs For The Whales' is a slow burner; almost bedtime storylike. 'Inchworm Parade' (exclusive to the CD single) is classic Robert Pollard solo material, sounding much like a 'Waved Out' outtake."
2,RCA ANTENNA Amplified,"Having another of this same model, I purchased this for another TV. It works fine at my location in a suburban location, the amplifier is a bonus to enable reception of distant stations."
2,Classic,A classic work by one of the old masters of science fiction even if a bit dated. May all Be presented.
2,too loud,"bass is amplified a tremendous amount. too bass heavy. good sound if you turn them up but they can damage your ears, they are very loud!!!! the highs are weak."
2,Itchy Bootie?,"Look its this simple. If you have an itchy bootie, burning, stink or any other problem then use these three times a day and thank me later!! This is a good price and they are perfect!"
2,great gundam series!,Gundam 0083 brings out the true essence of what gundamis really made of. It is a great series and the DVD has4 episodes so its pretty good.
2,"Haunting, Engaging Tale","Othersyde is a complex weave of teenagers trying to establish themselves in society and get the respect of their peers, but also the eerie tale of an unseen force trying to wreak havoc upon the world.From the tick-tick-ticking of the telegraph key, to the foreshadowing of Babylon 5 (not yet a series or pilot at time of publish) - Straczynski has a way of pulling you in, locking you up, and then spitting you back out wanting more.If you can find this book - you will not be disappointed!"
2,WHERE IS THE FULL FOREMOST POETS CD?!,"This is a great jazz/broken beat/funk/house comp CD, but my burning question is...after sterling singles like MOONRAKER and now OPEN SEASON, where oh where is the full-length debut from FOREMOST POETS aka JOHNNY DANGEROUS? They make intelligent, twisted, spacey tech-house and need to be heard!"
2,Fantastic!,I did not want to watch this show when it first came out but I gave it a shot and now I LOVE IT!!! Highly recommended!
2,"Prometheus Unbound, Highly Recommended","If you are intrigued by genius or what David Keirsey calls the Promethean temperament, then you need go no further than this book. Cheney makes you feel as if you are there in the room with Tesla as he lectures in front of a wowed audience. The breadth and depth of Tesla's genius is astounding. As I read it, I was struck by how exciting Tesla's research was (anyone who thinks science is boring should read this book). He had some profound (if sometimes off the wall) theories on how to use electricity. It is a truly sad ordeal, though, to see Tesla at middle age, bitter because so many of his inventions had been ignored or stolen. But hopefully books like this will bring recognition to his myriad of inventions. He was certainly worthy of a Nobel Prize, at the very least for his invention of the alternating current."
2,Sung with feeling and the absolute TOPZ!!!,"Whitney Houston is one of the best singers there ever was, her music is inspirational, tuoching and not to mention HOT!!! She has the best voice that I have ever heard."
2,Pretty good,"As fun as a game of Scrabble can be. This software plays a pretty good game of Scrabble. You can set the level of competition, although it's pretty tough to beat at the highest level unless you are a tournament-worthy player yourself."
2,Great Read!,I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys Mary Stewart's romantic mysteries. I'm so glad that they are being reissued as Rediscovered Classics.
2,I expected a different end,"Though the movie is good, I would have felt more better if they have left Joe back to his old home instead of any man made home even if it is very large. Rest the movie was good as like other disney movies"
2,Ender's Game may the one of the best sci-fi books ever written...,I give this book to anyone who I think will get it. There is a lot more to it than meets the eye. I gain something new every time I reread it. Definitely give this one a chance!
2,Just what my roasts need,"To give a little more information than is on the Amazon site, this rack is reversible, so that there is a choice between 3/8 and 1/2 inches for the height the roast is raised above the bottom of the pan. Also, I e-mailed the company to answer a couple of questions and was told that this product can go up to 572 degrees F (300 degrees C) in the oven no more, and it is oven safe and dishwasher safe. In a second e-mail to the company on May 2, I learned that the rack is made of chrome, and the company is saying that it will not rust."
2,Every Web developer should buy this book!,"I've bought many HTML, JAVASCRIPT, CSS, and DHTML guide books. Although, many books teach about tags and programming logic, they forget to add pratical examples that normal humans can use right away.This is a must have for all Internet developers and Internet Marketing experts"
2,Awesome!!!!,"I love this series! This is my favorite book out of this series! It is a really good book. Janete Oke is one of my favorite authors. You have got to read ""The Meeting Place""!!!!"
2,From the back cover:,"A stolen kiss, a midnight visit and suddenly oil baton Cade Gallagher found himself married to a virginal Tamiri princess! Honor demanded Cade pledge himself to Leila Kamal to save the lovely princess's reputation. Only the two of them knew the truth, that Leila remained untouched. Come hell or devil's own temptation, Cade vowed to keep her that way. Leila might be innocent, but she knew the agony of forbidden desire when she saw it in a man's eyes. Her tall, stubborn Texan of a husband might think he was being noble. But honorable intentions were no match for a princess determined to be a wife in every way!"
2,"EXCITING STORY, FREE WILLY WITH A DOLPHIN","The author, former trainer for dolphins starring on the much beloved Flipper tv series, details his struggle with big industry while he tries to return dolphins to the wild. There is a big trial in which the author loses a sizable civil fine for his liberation activities. He still has a let's get on with life joie de vivre about him. O'Barry's life is the stuff of drama and he's a modern day David in the eternal struggle with Goliath, in this case the captivity industry."
2,This is the most wonderful slice of cheese ever put on DVD,"I was thrilled when this came out on DVD! I think this is one of the worst adaptations of the story of Dracula! It is nothing like the Edward Gorey inspired play that made Langella famous in the roll, it is directed by a genious, has a stellar cast, wonderful score (John Williams for pete sake!) but it is all wrong.Why do I love it so? Because it is all wrong. It makes no sense to me, I'm not a ""goth"" nut or anything, but I love this movie!"
2,CUTE!!!,Another gift for our daughter...she loves this!!!Great to have something that doesn't require a battery or make noise!!!Every little girl needs this first purse and the accessories that come with it...just too cute to pass up!!!
2,Why did I like this CD?,"Not sure. However, as a jazz lover, I heard ""La Mer"" at a social function played by a totally eclectic DJ. I quickly asked, ""Wow, WHO the heck is that?!"" I couldn't believe it was NIN! I bought the CD just to check out the other compositions and enjoyed them as well. Never followed the band in their hey-day, too dark and satanic for my taste. But as a lover of fresh sounds, I'm glad to add this one to my extensive (and yes electic) library."
2,Loved this book,I have now read five books by Joel Rosenberg and loved every one of them. He is more current than the nightly news broadcasts. Perhaps the politicians in Washington should follow his lead!!
2,Boys love these toys,"My 5 y/o son bought this with his own birthday money as he has a lot of the other Imaginext toys. The Eagle and 'owner' came with his as it had another box of goodies attached when he made his purchase. He loves all the imaginext toys. very sturdy and has trap doors, lights and sounds. great toy."
2,The Best Live Album By A Mile,If Live had of kept up with this style they would be one of the greatest rock bands ever. Instead they went stupid and are now no more than Limp Bizkit tryhards. The Distance To Here is good but this is their best easily. Go out and get it!
2,DORA STYLING SEA THRONE,"This is a really nice toy my daughter enjoyed playing with it,she has always wanted the Dora Styling throne and she was very happy when i got as a Christmas present for her. Amazon Rocks"
2,"Powerful, provocative and masterful guide to your voice.","Jam-packed with powerful insights, Dr. Cooper teaches ambitious readers how to gain control of their voices and improve their chances of success. Recognizing the power of voice in the success equation, ""Change Your Voice, Change Your Life"" abundantly gives the ""trade secrets"" needed to transform ordinary voices into powerful megaphones of success. Rejecting the notion that voice is inborn and unchangeable, Dr. Cooper teaches interested readers the easy, straightforward steps to developing an influential voice. With extraordinary clarity, this book proves that voice is, in fact, one of the most overlooked but powerful ingredients of success. By following Dr. Cooper's lively, entertaining discussion, readers truly change their voices and indeed their lives."
2,A suitable job for a woman,Good non-fiction read. I enjoy learning about jobs that most woman only think about doing.
2,Walking through the rooms in my head....,"Back in the early 90's I was walking through Circuit City when this beautiful singing voice caught my attention. I followed that sound over to the video department where I fell in love with Shakespear's Sister ""Stay"". It sounded amazing. I immediately sought out the cd. I've been a fan all these years. ""Stay"" is still a really cool song. The video is pretty cool too.~"
2,Awesome!,"Love these! ""There is no fear where love exists. Rather, perfect love banishes fear, for fear involves punishment, and the person who lives in fear has not been perfected in love."" 1 John 4:18"
2,Lots of hooks! Love it!,In a tiny house with no hall closet my husband & are were desperate for a coat rack to hold EVERYTHING! It was incredibly easy to assemble. A little wobbly b/c of a design flaw in the base but has never tipped. I even tested it by hanging all of our winter coats on one side to see if it would tip. DIDN'T TIP!! It's been a great addition to our house & fits in with the decor. Excellant coat rack at a great price!
2,Still going strong after eight years,"Just don't use it on the stovetop! It should be obvious, but mine got put on the stove at one point. The plastic handle started to smoke a bit and there was no serious damage done.Makes good tea, easy to see the progress of the brewing. Cleans easily as well. Not used daily though."
2,great service!,"I can't find this cd anywhere in stores luckily when I ordered it, it came in less than a week and in great condition!"
2,best,nintendo rules it has all the best consoles and handhelds i dont use the WI-FI but is ok but unneeded the daul screens is a great feature i also like the stylus i like it how the ds folds oh and 1 of my favorite features is the rechargable battery i like that you can choose beetween a silver or blue ds i got a blue one pros its nintendo reachargable batttery daul screen it folds like the gameboy sp daul screen cons why do you need WI-FI
2,Henry V,"Great seller and the movie arrived fast, and it was in excellent condition. No problems. Thanks."
2,I like films about witch hunters and so forth,"My copy is on the way . I held out on streaming this unrated Blue Undergroud dvd for a good while . I'm VERY glad i finally got around to it though . If you like films like TWINS OF EVIL , WITCHFINDER GENERAL and so on (i recently streamed a similar era film with Udo Kier) , This may well be for you . It really helps if you are a Chris Lee fan . He's very good here . This Jess Fraco film is fairly similar to a Hammer or Amicus film . Check it out ."
2,A remarkable introductory text,"This book is succinct and replete with information. Lightfoot addresses most of the major questions pertaining to the process of Scripture being written, copied, preserved and transmitted through the course of history. He is very economical with his words, avoiding pedantry and maintaining a readable style. While this book will lead the serious student to do further reading, one cannot ask more from an introductory text on this topic. Highly recommended."
2,"Good product, sucks putting it in the car","It works great, but removing the old one and putting in a new one is a B."
2,Great speaker,"I have 3 pair of this speaker all through my house. As I get older I'm loosing hearing at the top end of the sound scale and these help to bring the music alive. Not too bright as might be expected with a tweeter, just enough."
2,Oldie but Goodie,"Having had this book around the house for ages, I picked it up and to my surprise within a few minutes really understood (not just enough to use, but actually understood) what logarithms really are, where they come from. The chapter on e, pi, and i is another great one to get the story behind the story, as it were. For me the book could better have continued in this vein of explaining concepts we've seen before but never really grasped intuitively, and perhaps because I'm not terribly interested in mathematical games I found that segment less fun. But in fairness, they've done a good job getting away from textbook math and into some interesting themes. I don't know if it's all still valid, as it is so old--references to Fermat's last theorem are at least outdated!"
2,Fujifilm Finepix S9100,"I really like this camera. Picture quality is great and it's easy to use. Battery life is exceptional. If there's anything that might deserve a negative remark, it's the flash; the flash tends to wash out the picture pretty bad in some instances. Other than that, I'm really pleased with the purchase."
2,best out there,"delivery was super fast, this is my favorite soap , great smell and cleans super awesome.. try it you'll like it. guaranteed.. and it's cheap"
2,Hippo in the Garden,A book that bears rereading from time to time. Always fresh no matter how many times you do. Informative and thought provoking.
2,awsomeness,this game is intense the matches are so good the season this year is the best the roster is fairly complete i was amazed cause of the lack of wrestlers in the last game. voice over in the season mode the lips mactch the words not like the last one were you could here the talking all you seen was blah blah blahand stupid hand jestures it was nothing compared to 2006. its agreat game i luv it the first match i did was for survivor serios in memory of eddie i made a match with eddie and batista. it was fun i enjoy the matches in this game very detailed and relistic. well thats all i have this game is greatgod bless you eddie guerrero
2,Great starter/Newbie book,I found this to be a great source before tackling the different parts of my Jeep. Helped me to keep cost down by not making mistakes on upgrades.
2,Great Highchair,"What a great highchair. I use this daily to feed my son and I really like it! I love the 5 point harness especially since my ds thinks he can climb out of the chair and walk on air lol. I also like the ease of cleaning the cover. Wipe it down and put it back on, breezy!This isn't a small chair, but it folds rather compactly and can be moved with relative ease, just be sure to take the brakes off first!"
2,High score with minimal effort.,"This book summarizes the main points in a very lucid and concise manner with small number of carefully selected examples which emphasizes the main idea. Because of the unique format of this book, students can grasp the main idea in a shortest time with minimal effort. This book can be helpful to review the main ideas before the exams or to grasp the main idea before studying the subject in more detail."
2,A Charmer,"This is a very nice surprise. Dylan Walsh is excellent and the young actor playing the kid is also very good. Makes you want to be a better parent, which is always a good thing!"
2,A Joy To Read....,"This book is a joy to read. You can take it out on the bus or train, open to any page, and receive a nugget of wisdom from various traditions that will give you food for thought for the rest of the day. I know what my friends are getting for Christmas..."
2,Nice curls,I love the different heat levels and the heat burst. It allows me to have tight or loose curls or just make nice waves in my hair.
2,Awsome,"The different between having a GPS that that works and one that doesn't.I live in Sao Paulo, Brasil, and the reception without the Gilsson Antenna, was very poor. Sometimes I arrived to my destination and the GPS still didn't catch any satellites.With the Gilsson antenna it catches almost every satellite and the precision is of about 3 metres (9 feet).I would definitely recomend it."
2,Good Thriller,"Though not nearly as good as Case's The Genesis Code, the book is still engaging and has a lot of interesting scientific information that is simple enough for the layman to understand yet detailed enough to grab the attention of a scientist. It's somewhat slow moving at times, and becomes kind of obvious towards the end, but Case manages to maintain our interest with his very good story telling, allowing the bits and pieces into place as the story progresses. And it has neat ending."
2,Just perfect,"I bought this item for my vacations and it was nothing but perfect. I cannot believe the crisp vision, no fog, no UV radiation. Wish I had them 20 years ago when I used to compete. :)"
2,Perfect,Exactly what I wanted and was completely brand new. Very excited to own this. The brush is very soft and easy to use. It holds quite a lot of watercolor and picks up color very well. I will definitely have to own more of these brushes.
2,Small but cute,"I bought these for my six mo old niece.... Cute and shiny. Fast delivery, very happy with this product. One thing the picture obviously big... When u get them really small. But worth it the diamond is shiny.. So I am happy."
2,pure and refreshing,"It's a lot of fun to hear music that wasn't created with the burden of any inhibitions, and that is why I have nothing but good things to say about the Melvins and this particular album (actually 2 albums). Like the majority of us outside the Pacific Northwest, I was turned on to the Melvins courtesy of Kurt Cobain in the early nineties and I bought Houdini. Houdini is good, but this would have been a more appropriate introduction to their music and I'm glad to finally hear their music from the ground up."
2,They did it!! (took 3 tries),"Well, after thinking about it, I finally got Untouchables. Issues was a total disappiontment in my opinion. This is a full recovery of Korn. Their downhill streak is snapped by this CD. Does it sound like the first album? not exactly but it's truly their best effort since the killer 1994 album. Go buy this"
2,A Strong Hardcore Album by Hatebreed,"This is not really my favorite Hatebreed album but it is certainly a strong album from the band. If you like your hardcore pissed off and brutal, then you will probably dig this.My three favorite songs on this album are:Tear It DownFacing What Consumes YouChoose or Be ChosenHatebreed fans will not be disappointed."
2,Recommended for everyone who likes erotic DVD's,This is an excellent erotic DVD. I think of this is more like Playboy. I would recommend this to every erotic DVD fan. I like erotic DVD's because they are more appropiate than porn DVD's.
2,You must read this book!,"Just finished reading this for the umpteenth time and it still amazes me. The first time I read it I had borrowed it from my sister. I kept it so long, and read it so often, she finally bought me my own copy so she could have hers back. This book is hysterically funny, nostalgic, heartbreaking, and soul healing. The words on the pages never change, but it's a slightly different book every time I read it. I can't recommend this book highly enough."
2,Alcatraz showed promise; bummed to see it cancelled.,"The show may have had a few weaknesses but it was great to see ""Hurley"" and Sam Neill again. Overall, the series showed promise... but, unfortunately, that's just the kind of show that Fox likes to cancel."
2,Expansion Disks,"I recently purchased Karaoke Revolution and the game itself is great fun, I was very pleased to have purchased it but there are a couple of negatives, one being that all the songs are either pop, rock and an oldie or two but no country songs, but I purchased it under the impression that expansion disks could be purchased, it even says it in the directions and on the game disk itself how to use them, but I cannot find them any where.I do not think that a game should be put on the market untill it offers what it claims. The package does not say expansion disks coming soon."
2,Great short stories . . .,"give lively insight into the rich array of characters that make up the population in and around Bangkok. A definite must read for anyone traveling to the area, or been there, or with interest. I read it while traveling around Thailand, and it bread depth into the land and culture."
2,The Awakening Land,The story is about pioneers in the Ohio country in the early 1800s. It deals with life as it really was in those days. The story mainly revolves around Elilabeth Montgomery and how she deals with all the hardships that she and her broken family go through. There are many side stories dealing with other members of the family and neighbors. The acting was good and the locales were acurate. It was very entertaining. I would highly recomend this mini-series.
2,The best movie is from Amazon.,"Road House is a favorite movie of my husband and I. Patrick Swazie was great in any movie he made. In this movie, he shows right from wrong is a good thing. He goes from Road House to Road House. fightly & cleaning out the bad guys. He hit a very bad time in this movie. It will cost him his best friend & maybe the love of his life. There are some fights, & funny stuff too. It is laughable when a Polar bear fall's on ""Skeeter"". If you haven't seen this movie, you've got to see it. Amazon has the best price for ""Road House""."
2,Great,"I thought that the product was great, and the shipping time was faster than expected. The only thing I found wrong with the CD was that the case was cracked but that could have happened during the shipping process."
2,its a great follow up!!,Safe Ride Home is a great follow up to thier first album Count To Ten. If your a FrogPond fan then you should own it. And if you ever get the chance to see them live it will blow you away. I love this album and you all will to. Its a must have.
2,Tough and Well Written,"I read this a long time ago, and it still sticks in my mind. An excellent account of solitude in the West."
2,McIntyre's 4th per. English,"I think shade's children is a good sci-fi futuristic book. The author weaves real human thoughts and emotions that people actually think into the story, along with interviews of the characters to give a little background information."
2,Best book written on D-Day to the surrender of the Germans.,"I am a 14 year old homeschooler, who read this book because I enjoy history. This book puts the works of the author, Stephen Ambrose, together. I found it had some great information on the Allied forces and what they had to go through in order to win the war. It made me respect the veterans of WWII and I hope every one who reads this book has the same results."
2,Great first sc-fi novel,"The author is straight on with military life, You could put the characters on a modern navy ship instead of a space-ship and they would fit right in!The story is fast-paced and with some great action! I highly recommend this for those who like military sc-fi.When are the sequels arriving! Put me on the per-order list!"
2,The Best,Stash Mint Tea is my favorite mint tea because the strength of the tea is preserved and enhanced by being packaged in the individual packets. It seems to have more flavor when it is protected from the air. I really enjoy drinking it in the morning. It helps with my digestion and calms my various stomach issues.
2,Food for thought,This was truly an enjoyable read and I'm not a huge reader. I was hooked from the start and the character of Dottie continued to draw me in. Very revealing about how young female minds work - similar to An Egg on Three Sticks which I highly recommend.
2,The Polks' history is American History,"The contribution of the Polk family is mindboggling. Author Polk captures both the extraordinary characters that built this country and disabuses readers of any notions that all of his ancestors were saints. It's the best book on American history I've ever read. As a dynasty, the Polks are true American royalty, flawed and all."
2,When you were as good as your word,"Five were one of the most successful recent collectives who brought back the seldom heard, unabashed old-school hip hop style centered more around unadulterated flow, fun, and positivity- a glaring contrast to the vast majority of grimly faux-street, cool depressants out there. This group of hungry emcees do not waste much time, tearing into their rhymes with a love for the syllable and usually enduring samples, forgetting to act cool and simply being it by selflessly honing delivery."
2,"Diffecult but not Impossible, maybe....","I just finished Riven and it was one of the most exciting games I have ever played, if not the most. The graphics were superb and I felt like I was on a roller-coaster ride many times. The puzzles were diffecult, but I got through the majority of them with only a few hints, but I'm not sure I could have done it without help. I'm really looking forward to whatever sequel RedOrb has in mind. It will be at the top of my list as soon as it is released. Check out the web site on the Riven box for input and help, but then if you are as into puzzles as Riven fans are, you don't need that hint. Go for it. Give your imagination some exercise."
2,Fun!,"We mounted this to the wall of our one twin year-old's playroom. They're too little yet to figure out how to latch and unlatch thing, but they enjoy swing the doors open and close."
2,Great for Nostalgia Buffs,"As other reviews of books in the Showcase Presents series have noted, this is DC's version of the Marvel Essentials series-- B&W reproductions of comics published decades ago. The comics in this particular edition were originally published between June '58 and Nov '59, when I was eight and nine years old and a voracious comics reader. Even now, I can actually remember reading some of the particular comics that are in this book, and while, to an adult, the stories here are simplistic and even sometimes silly, it was, for nostalgia purposes alone, a real delight to get to re-read them again for the inexpensive price of ten dollars. In fact I sort of feel sorry for children growing up now, who have to make do with comics that are kind of grim and sordid, in contrast to the clearly drawn, cheerful and good-hearted ones that existed back in the fifties and sixties."
2,great listening,"This CD was all that I expected and hoped it would be. It has the wonderful acapella gospel songs that Ernie finished his shows with,great listening."
2,Works for me,I've had this router connected for about a month and it works fine for me. I'm not a serious gamer so the speed is probably a bit over kill for what I do (internet and file sharing which includes video). Wasn't real hard to set up. I'm happy!
2,Really liked this book.,"If you are a trader or investor, regardless of how long (or particularly how little) you've been at it, this should be required reading for everyone. Very entertaining reading that has some many practical lessons throughout; lessons that Mr. Schwager is kind enough to summarize at the end of the text. Take notes and apply what you learn and it should improve your trading."
2,It's the Vurt-U-Want,"Vurt is a wild ride across the dreamscape of the mind. Anexcellent first novel, that promises the reader both excitementfor this work and for future works by Mr. Noon.The characters are fairly well developed, and the landscapeboth visual and surreal. The storyline involves a futuristicdrug, a thing from outer space, a ""gang"" and a lost love.The drug causes the usual societal problems, crime, sex,violence, and lack of respect for police. But it also leadsthe protaganist on a journey of learning, longing andmetaphysical discovery. Not bad for a brightly coloredfeather and a bunch of Dog People, Robots, humans and variouscombinations of those.While I wouldn't want to call it, like the book jacket does,the ""Clockwork Orange of the '90's,"" it is a futuristic,rampaging youth, thriller that performs well.I look forward to reading more from Mr. Noon."
2,This is the better album of that series,"I still like to mention this album in conversations, because some of today's songs, even country band Lonestar's power ballads like Amazed, borrow from this rock album. I like the choices of songs from the heavy metal bands here. But the writing is very good, the musical arrangements are dynamite and there's a loudness to the power ballads that can rival their heavy rockers! Firehouse, L A Guns, Poison and some others have some very dynamite songs here. This is the much better album of that series, versus the more commercial sheen of the first."
2,Tire Width Fit Depends on Model Version,"If you stagger the height of the hooks, you can fit the bikes closely and have them all upright. I prefer them all upright to make it easier for the misses and kids. This is an effective and somewhat cheap to hang your bikes. However, before buying, I suggesting checking which model you'll be getting. Different model fits different tire width. The latest model fits up to 3.0"" tire width, which is not what I received when I ordered from Amazon. This is maybe why they're selling at a discount. Of course, Amazon's service is top notch and they did it right.The product is great but it's getting four stars because the maker didn't update their product labeling when they updated their product. There's no way to tell which version you'll get until you can measure the inner diameter of the hook. Hopes this helps."
2,Sterling Silver Dainy Blue Donute Shape Earrings,"Although the spheres are larger, more oval, and a lighter blue than shown in the picture, the earrings are beautiful."
2,Great workout!,I love her workout videos! I am glad I stopped going to the gym and wasting my money becuase I get a better workout with Jillian Michaels.
2,If you are looking you know,One of the best things put on cd ever. Great music for your workout playist and driving and ......ya its just awesome.
2,Terrible---But not anymore.,"I got this as a first anniversary gift for my wife. The second time she wore it, a week after receiving it, the bracelet broke, fell off her wrist and is now lost. I will be contacting Amazon about the quality of this jewelry; hopefully the quality of their customer service is better than their jewelry. I will keep you informed.-- UPDATE---Their customer service was fantastic. I feel bad that it took me so long to update my rating. highly RECOMMEND."
2,Good for extra recipes,"I bought this book, along with the Starving Students' Vegetarian Cookbook, and it's a good source for extra recipes (I think Starving Students' is the best--I have both Starving Students' cookbooks). I haven't tried any of the recipes yet, just flipped through the pages. Looks like some good stuff in there. But I still recommend Starving Students' over this one--only reason why it has four stars, instead of five."
2,Memories,I remember my grandparents reading these stories to me when I was a kid. Now- it's my turn. The book is exactly the way I remember it. I hope it can last until it's my children's turn to read it to their grandchildren.
2,excellent,"snug fit and stiff but such was expected; orange material and reflectivevstrip a extremely bright, can't be missed by anyone with functioning eyes. Tactile grip on fingers and palms offsets poor grasp function due to overall stiffness. Keeps the wet out as long as cuff not immersed(of course). Keeps people away on subway...they don't know what to think..MTA worker? Cop? Crazy? nice side effect."
2,I want ALL complete seasons of Designing Women,"I have been waiting patiently for ALL complete seasons to start being available. I know there are a lot of people out there that have been waiting a long time for this to happen. Please, please, please make the entire absolutely wonderful series available to all of us die hard fans. I keep checking every once in a while and you STILL only have the ""Best of."" I want more!!!"
2,Fantastic Knife,"Bought this for my son. We both love it. Very slim, sleek. With the spring assist it is very easy to open. Super sharp out of the box. It can be locked to not open while being carried. Very nice safety feature. Very pleased. Now I am Jealous and want one for me!!!!"
2,3RD ROCK IS HILARIOUS!!!,If your a 3rd rock fan - you will not be disappointed.There are always more and more mihaps as the 4 aliens strive to blend into human culture.The stories do not get old and the laughs keep coming.Enjoy!
2,Great advice for parents and teachers,"What an inspirational book -- it should be mandatory reading for all parents and teachers! Each chapter relates one child and what the author learned from that child. It is such a shame that so many parents of small children ruin them because they don't understand their children's needs. So much damage can be done to a child's feeling of self-worth that it may take decades to overcome, if at all. Children are all born innocent and develop into what their parents and environment teach them. This book informs parents and teachers how young children should be treated to allow them to grow into happy, well-adjusted adults. Wonderfully done!! If you are a parent of a young child, please read this book ... you'll be glad you did!"
2,Fracktured Flickers,I used to watch this when I was a kid. Really funny. Han Conried is really funny and an excellent host for the show.
2,Some of the best short stories I've read,These delicate short stories tell harrowing tales of love and loss with something rare in modern literature - absolute respect for the characters and the reader.I'm really looking forward to Tony Earley's novel that contains some of the characters from the last three stories in this collection.Bill
2,Car seat,Good design although a 3 point harness would have been great as younger children can escape while driving. The build is great with a very comfortable seat and best of all it doesn't slide around while empty. I would recommend this for 3 year olds and older.
2,Fantastic!,"My 13 month old daughter LOVES this and so do I! It is easy to use, easy to install. She signs for bike and helmet twice a day at least. Some may think it throws you off balance, but not at all. My daughter even gets excited and bounces around and it is fine. I did have to move my gears around a bit, but it was no biggie."
2,Good price + free shipping = no-brainer,"I bought this for $3.99 and the shipping on it was free, by itself. It feels secure in your hand and it has done a good job so far. I would not recommend that you use it as a replacement for a peeler, but it definitely deserves your consideration to scrub the dirt and chemicals from the outside layer of vegetables.The circular grip is something that will probably be hit or miss for some people, as would a long handle for other people. I like the ergonomics of this product and I think others would as well."
2,A fascinating look into another time's mores,"Of course this is a classic of American literature, and, to my mind, with good reason. The story engages and puts one in the time. It requires a modern reader to stretch, but the exercise rewards."
2,A master's stroke!,"Vocalist extraordinaire Mark Boals put together a fantastic line up after his last endeavor with Yngwie Malmsteen ,all in the name of recording this beautiful and compelling mixture of speed,progressive and neoclassical rock;Tony Macalpine shines all over this impressive recording,backed up by the up and coming Australian drummer virtuoso Virgil Donati.The album flows with ease engaging the listener from the start to finish.Now together as a band,Ring of Fire are true keepers of the flame!"
2,An Undiscovered Diamond,"I was shocked to find that not a single word of praise has been written, not just for this wonderful book, but for the whole series! Worse, most of the rest of the series are already out of print! And if you have not read these books I do highly recommend that you start with ""Skinner's Rules"" and work your way through them. While good, this book is not the best in the Bob Skinner series. In this book we find Skinner almost complacent in his successful career and family life. Only near the end does the tough-as-nails street cop flash out from behind the civility. As a style these ""police procedurals"" are first rate mysteries, the ""Skinner"" series among the best of the lot. I highly recommend them as being as good as Robert B. Parker's ""Spenser"" novels."
2,Simple and durable bag,Got this bag for military use to supplement the A3 bags we are issued so I can have a simple bag with my personal gear. Great canvas bag that feels sturdy enough to take a lot of abuse. It's about 2/3 the size of an A3 bag and to me feels slightly more durable with thicker fabric so I am pleased with it. A3 bags have a waterproof coating on the inside but this does not so I will spray it with some scotch guard just in case it is left sitting outside on a pallet. FYI... It has small D rings at the ends of the zipper that look like they are for a shoulder strap but no strap included. I don't plan on using a shoulder strap as I like using the 2 handles as shoulder straps and wearing it like a backpack to haul it long distances if I have it loaded up with heavy gear. The handles on this bag seem well suited to do that.
2,Amazing book about an amazing man.,"I really enjoyed this book as I learned so much not just about history, but about this amazing man. He lived through personal difficulties, personal tragedies and even when things were going very badly, where even his friends stood against him, he stuck to what he believed in. A man with true gumption, yet empathy for his fellow man and a depth of understanding that is truely astounding."
2,Always love the Good Wife,"Well, what can I say? Just a great show.... what else can I say? Not much, I just love the show!"
2,A Great Buy!,"I wasn't much for cooking...BEFORE I bought this cookbook!Now, my family ALWAYS wants me to cook, and brags about how good I am! Little do they know, that I have this secret cookbook! All of the recipes are very ""homemade"" tasting! It has appetizers, classic recipes, tex-mex, everything! I highly recommend it, any dish I've made out of it, has been quick, easy, and a crowd favorite!"
2,You may end up reading the whole series!,"What the Author Bodie posted on Facebook about this novel.........Sisters of the Thoene Nation...In researching The Zion Chronicles, I met a beautiful Jewish Daughter of Zion who had been taken by the Nazis as a young, innocent teenager and used as a prostitute by Nazi officers in an SS brothel. I called her Rachel in my novels, but she is based on a real person who survived. Her courage and spiritual battle to be whole and healed, inspired my life and work. I never imagined that such evil against women continued and INCREASED in our time! I believe that the Redemption and Restoration of Rachel represents many, many young women in our world today who have been taken, held captive, abused and used. JOIN ME IN PRAYER TODAY AT NOON FOR THE FREEDOM OF MILLIONS OF CAPTIVE WOMEN AND CHILDREN! God bless all in this house!"
2,what r u waiting for?,"I think this game is the best and i agree who cares about gameplay. I think it is the way u play the game and approach it. This is for people that don't hav the game, don't listen to those idiots, trust me, get the game u will like it(if u like racing games)."
2,Fabulous Audio for a small room,"These speakers offer full, sound that easily fills a small room. The treble clarity is particularly crisp with the MicroTractrix Horn, and the bass is deep and powerful. The speakers have a relatively small footprint for their sound, but will take up some room on your desk if that is a factor (each speaker is about the width of an oversized coffee mug). One precaution is that the subwoofer has very thin feet on it, making the bass travel through into the surrounding rooms, so if you live in an apartment or dorm and this is a concern, I suggest resting the subwoofer on a towel to absorb some of the noise. Overall, a fabulous product, and worth the list price. If you can find it on sale, grab it!"
2,Great set; but Terrible Packaging,Did anyone else have trouble getting these DVD's out of the case? I cant believe the incompetence in the packaging! I literally cracked one disc trying to free it from its holder. The people who designed this have to get a clue--there is no reason for these discs to be in so tight! Does anyone have any suggestions on how to pop them out easier?
2,It IS a hoax...geez,"Okay first and most important, the movie itself isn't all that bad. For the time period when it came out it was, in fact, pretty decent. It is a pretty good ghost-like story (I won't go into details as most people know them).But one thing that bothers me is the hoax vs not a hoax thing.The house is REAL....the murders are REAL....the tale of the haunting is 100% a hoax! The LUTZ family THEMSELVES came out and said it was made up years later....okay? Is that convincing enough for everyone? They came out and said it was a hoax. Period, end of story.But the movie is still a fun watch ;)"
2,Not a Bad Track in This Mix,"As being a huge fan of Clever, I always appreciate his thought process that goes into track selections for a mix, as well as the mix itself. However, Breakbeat Science: Exercise 5 was a little awkward for me. I thought the tracks overall were pretty good, but the mix itself was where I was having trouble. At times it felt too rushed & really good songs went by too fast & the mediocre ones were hanging around too long. I would though (in the end), recommend this mix; if you played this for anyone who had never heard Clever before, they would definetly ask who it is...you know? Check out Troubled Waters & a June issue of ""Knowledge"" magazine (there's a FREE Clever mix with that issue & it's solid)."
2,awesome,"fits perfect. exactly what i ordered. fit my low pinion dana 30 as needed. it includes everythig. all spacers, bearings and gaskets"
2,The Muppets and Travelin Tyke,The Muppets really are timeless. I remember watching these when I was a child and now I buying these for my children. These will always be timeless. Has anyone seen the Travelin Tyke video? [website]
2,City Hotel,"In 1960, a lovely little witch horror film set in Massachusettes was produced in England by the fledgling Amicus Films, then called Vulcan Films. It starred Christopher Lee, Betta St. John, Patricia Jessel, Venetia Stevenson, & Valentine Dyall, and was entitled CITY OF THE DEAD, or HORROR HOTEL here in the U.S. It tells the story of a young woman wishing to find out more about a particular witch that may or may not have survived burning at the stake. Needless to say, she finds out too much. I don't wish to elaborate on further plot details, suffice it to say that the scares are of the Val Lewton school of fright and are thus wonderful! The performances are of top caliber, in particular Lee, Jessel, and Dyall in rather sensationalistic roles. The other cast members also fare quite well thanks to director John Llewellyn Moxey's superb handling of an excellent screenplay. Be sure to visit this lovely city and book you reservation at the hotel. They're dying to meet you..."
2,So far so good,I've had this crockpot for about a month and it works very well. Made perfect polenta with it last week. I did have trouble with overnight Oatmeal but I am going to give that one another try. The best thing about it is that while most of the small crockpots I have come across do not have multiple heat settings - this one does. And it is pretty enough to keep out on the counter.
2,Nice machine,Makes great ice cream. I would say it's worth it but be prepared to do some prep. You have to freeze the canister. You don't save any money making your own ice cream but you do get to have fun experimenting with crazy flavours.
2,Open Your Ears - Please!!!,"I do not own this particular compilation, but I have two other verisons of each of the single CD releases [and of course I have my trusty old vinyl], and while I applaud the previous reviewer's insight and suggestion to provide an expanded version of LIVE - Please kindly refrain from bashing Penthouse!Give it a listen - Cheek to Cheek ala Alex!!!Nothing short of Brilliant!!! And lets not forget Runaway, and School's Out!!! Please!!!So, I ask that you put your predisposed disposition aside, crank up the volume, open your ears, and let the TAPES blow you away...[Of course, in case you hadn't noticed, I'm a wee bit biased when it comes to Alex :-)]Enjoy!!!"
2,Family Tree Guide Book to Europe,"Book is exectly what I was looking for.I bought it used and it is in excellent condition.I will continue to order from Amazon,com"
2,Product works great!,Adapter was what I expected. I am glad to know I can order them online. Hope you will still carry them.
2,Excuse me while I laugh...........,"The poor hero is stuck with a lady he considers the nag of all nags. The heroine is stuck with ""The Hammer"", a man she knows to be unspeakably cruel and brutal.To what lengths would you go to avoid an arranged marriage....Ms. Sands made a story that could be so yawningly typical, into a spitfire comedy of love. Terrific writing, likable characters and predicaments that you gotta see to believe. Throw in some delicious romance (and the poor hero that you've got feel sorry for-in a funny way), and you've got a book that I read practically in one sitting. Hang your ""Do Not Disturb"" sign, ladies........."
2,This one is a Upbeat Great Read,"I work in a Nursery School and the children get pretty antsy around Halloween. This one kept them all quiet and focusing onthe book. They LOVED it- I had to reread it again, and the other classes in our school had me come into their classes and read this story.Very imaginative and all the words rhyme!! I love books that have a beat and the words rhyme like this.Enjoy-"
2,Good beginner Juicer,"There is nothing better at this price point as far as juicers go. This is great and does the job well. There was a little more pulp than I'd like but if you are just starting juicing and don't want to spend several hundred on a top of the line juicer this is the place to start. Also didn't do the greatest with leafy greens, but great with fruit like apples, etc."
2,This book wonderfully changed me!,"I am blood type A. At the time when I started reading this book and trying the diet, I had been suffering from post-partum depression for 8 months. I felt miserable, my attitude was miserable and my family, friends and co-workers were paying the price. After being on the diet for a week, my mood began making a drastic change for the better and within a month, the post partum depression was gone. At that point I was actually able to bond with my baby for the first time. The large amount of fruits, vegetables, and soy (a way of eating that I had never thought of trying since I've grown up being a meat and potatoes girl) that the diet recommends did wonders.I highly recommend this book, whether you are suffering from an illness or not, as a refreshing change from your current routine."
2,"the best ""everyday bra"" I've found","For larger sizes this bra provides a very natural shape (not too pointy and not too spread out to the sides). It is so comfortable I have multiples (2 beige and a black).I will say that under lightweight fabric tops I do wear""dimmers"" to avoid letting everyone else know when I get cold. I have this issue with most bras though.Love the range of sizes offered by Fantasie! You just can't walk into the average department store and find a 36FF."
2,"A Good Little Book, Fun to Read","AS FOR THE QUALITY, there are tons of photos and examples in glossy vivid color. I think one of the best things about the book is that it gets your creating juices flowing. It does discuss a lot of Photoshop techniques, so those without an editing program may not enjoy it. And perhaps there is too much on printers; I prefer to send mine over the internet to companies like [...].Really advanced digital users may find it somewhat basic, but I think most users are basically intermediate, and this book fits the bill. It's chock-full of information, and there's just enough to send you in the right direction to go and explore on your own.I think it's a great ""intermediate introduction"" and I look forward to purchasing other books by Tom Ang."
2,Friendship of Misfits,"This book kinda sorta was about a team of young middle school kids who work together and go to the Academic Bowl.If this was a linear world, and this book was a documentary, that's what you'd say this book was about.Instead, Konigsburg tells a circuitous story, of four misfits and their misfit teacher, who develop a friendship amid a hostile world. In the process, they not only create their own, kinder world, but they gentle the world around them."
2,"Great introduction ""set"" for a science class.","Believe it or not, I use this book as a read-aloud for my 8th grade (13 year olds!) science class. I read it to them before beginning a unit on weather. Even this age finds it humorous. Add this to your collection!"
2,"Great singing and band , but similar styles can get boring","I'll take a chance here and say that most listeners will come to this album after getting a taste for Sam's style and maybe hearing most or all of his big hits .This is not an album for dancing , as the songs aren't romantic in the least .This album does set and maintain a mood - we had it playing in the car the other night and it was perfect for that time .However , there is not a lot of diversity in the songs and that was one of the great things about Sam .The last song is a departure and almost feels out of place - nothing leads up to it gently .The sound is wonderful but I recommend you listen to it at a record shop first to see if you like the whole thing ."
2,Gia was typical of modern youth,As I learned more and more about this woman I was extremely taken by how much of her I see in so many of my young counterparts today.
2,Once Near Death,"I was attracted to this book since just over one year after my mother died, I was a ""hit and run"" victim and thrown from my scooter and run over by a Toyota 4-Runner.An ICU nurse since 1983, I was unable to work for over a year but returned to an ""office"" position and am employed full-time.I have my life back.The book's layout is very attractive, the content easy to assimilate.I shared this book with our nurses who specialize in Pain Management and Oncology. Where I don't have direct contact with patients and their families in my current job, they are at the bedside daily.I enjoyed this book.Thank you."
2,A mom's review,"I took my nine year old daughter to Raise Your Voice, with minimal expectations. I have to say I was surprised to find myself really paying attention. I also cried in several places, and then had to try not to embarrass my daughter!Hilary is an average actress & singer, but she has a sweetness and innocence that draws you in. I wasn't expecting the sadness, but overall I felt quite comfortable having my daughter view this movie.Several scenes were a poor copy of FAME, but I guess you have to be as old as I am to remember that. It was all brand-new to my nine year old.Mom gives this a ""thumbs up""."
2,Not one thing wrong with this game,"I ordered this game based on all the reviews here and am glad I did. My husband and I are actually the only ones playing it so far. Our 4 year old enjoys setting the cars up per the cards instructions but can't problem solve to this degree, yet. Our 2 year old enjoys lining the cars up on the board, that has to be good for something, right? This is a great, compact, take anywhere, thinking game. Can't wait to gift it as well."
2,"Taste is really good, ingredients a bit iffy","All the enchilada sauces for Old El Paso are really tasty. Unfortunately they have both soy and gluten, which makes them off limits for a lot of people with food sensitivities (lost stars for that). But taste-wise, for everybody else, they are really good! The red sauce comes in hot, medium, and mild, and unlike some 'hot' sauces it doesn't sacrifice taste at all for the heat. The green sauce is very mild. My kid and friends love enchiladas made with either. I eat lowcarb, and often chop up cooked chicken, dice a little pepper/onion, and mix in a little enchilada sauce (sometimes a little cream cheese) and nuke it and stir. Yum."
2,Good system for the price,"First off, let me say that I'm satisfied with the system. It's not going to rattle the windows or wake the neighbors - but for ordinary movie watching with clear sound effects it is a good value.I've had this system for about 8 months and very seldom use the DVD. Last night we purchased Lost in Translation and the DVD skipped during the previews, then the player refused to load the DVD after I ejected and cleaned the disc.Long story short, I hacked the system according to Matta2k's instructions later in this message board and now it works perfectly.We'll see if I'm still satisfied at the end of the year."
2,I love my ipod!,"What a great device. It stores everything I could want and then some. Its battery life is a little disappointing after several months, which is why I'm giving it four stars. The navigation is smooth and very effective. Long plane flights and car trips seem far shorter with this gadget in my hand.Highly recommended!"
2,Great value,I am giving this product 4 stars instead of 5 only because I haven't had the opportunity to use it more than about a dozen times so far. Overall the quality of this product is good. The cutters are sharp and cut well and the winder work smoothly. At first I thought that the winder seemed to be a bit flimsy but I have come to realize that it is flexible to accommodate different sizes of tuner handles. Overall I have to say that I am very pleased with this.
2,Excellent grinder,"Have had several grinders of other brands and this is by far the best one at the best price yet. It grinds the coffee very evenly. So glad I made the choice to buy this one, due to the many positive feedback entries on this website!"
2,Works well,This is the best product out there for cats. It is effective and is safe for the cats. Watch the cheaper products--they could be harmful to your pets and ineffective.
2,Paradise,"This book was one of the best plots that EJD has ever made. This book was recommended to me by a friend and I am so glad that I got the pleasure of reading it. It is unlike any EJD book that i've read in the past, complete with all of hot scenes that EJD is known for. This is a definate MUST READ"
2,Mundi Change Purse (Black),"Very nice purse, really like it. Only negative is that it could be a little smaller,"
2,To Bring You My Love,"To Bring You My Love being Harvey's 1995 release and received great reviews from the critics when the album was released and the album did reasonably well peaking at #12 in the UK Album charts and #40 in the Billboard 200. Singles of this album where ""Down by the water"", ""C'Mon Billy"" and ""Send his love to me"". The booklet contains no lyrics, some nice photos of Ms Harvey and a list of whom and what they play on each track. 4/5."
2,Quality set of shoes,This is a nice set of shoes. I play on regular basis and bought this for my brother as a gift.
2,Son loves it.,My 3 yo loves this truck. It has held up so far to some pretty aggressive play and my son sitting on it(probably not recommended).
2,Raving Rabbids,So much crazy psycho laugh out loud fun. Rabbids will have moments where I am just sitting on the couch laughing. I only gave it 4 stars because some of the other Rabbids were more enjoyable to play. Like the TV one.
2,You will use it,"Simple to use, and good results. Negative aspect is that it is a space hog and the impaling rods are sharp. Not a good gift for the eldery. It takes finese and some strength to load a leg of lamb or chicken on the sharp daggars. Caution needed.However easy to clean, the spit does well in the dishwasher.You need to grease the pivot points w/ oil each time you use (I use olive oil). Otherwise it will make and odd sound like whale noises.The unit does get hot, which is the point, avoid over hung cabinets or placing it in reach of children.I have always covered the drip pan w/ aluminum foil, and after a year the pan is still like new."
2,Great Universal Remote,"This remote is very easy to setup. All the functions work well. The only thing I notice is that sometimes you have to really push a button hard to get the command to initiate. Although this could be perceived as a pain, it is much better than having over sensitive buttons."
2,cable booster,My cable repair man suggested a cable booster. I know very little about the subject but this gadget makes our TV come in clearer and the cable on the computer is faster. Works for me
2,Better than Death!,"Hey, when i first heard this album i was like um...okay..i should have just brought the smashing pumpkins album i wanted so much...and then after a few hundreds of more listens it got stuck on me like any sexy chick would have been when they saw me do a reverse bow! simply nice! some very violent tunes but understandable. the song shoot this is simply rubbish. they shouldve just made an Ep and not a lp. what a waste of my time! i had better things to do like fill my girlfriends taco with meat and many many more! but an effort not wasted by attempt of the new band it twas. that is great i suppose! i recommend this CD to deaf people!! so they can become un-deaf. the melodies! URGH! too good i love it."
2,phone battery,"This is just a replacement battery for a cordless phone, but it is a OEM type battery and not a cheap replacement. Shipping was quick and with ordering two (two handsets) the price including the shipping was less than buying at a retail outlet."
2,Solid follow-up to Ender's Game,Read Ender's Game on a recommendation and purchased Speaker for the Dead before I was even finished with the first book. Orson Card does a great job of pivoting from one story to the next that I was unable to put down Speaker for the Dead.
2,Christmas Leg Lamp,"I bought this for my husband for Christmas as a joke. The Christmas Story is his favorite movie. He loved the lamp SO much that it is a permanant fixture on the table beside his chair in the living room. It is definately a great conversation piece and is small, but more adaptable than the larger version."
2,Classic MST,"If you are a MST fan, you will love this one. The movie is terrible - that's why it was selected for MST - and Mike and the bots do a great job of poking fun. It's almost too easy. The only down side is typical of the Rhino videos - Rhino does a terrible job of mixing the audio, so the audio from the movie is very hard to hear, while the audio from Mike and the bots is quite clear. That means you miss the point of some of the jabs. Hopefully, now that Shout Factory has taken the MST videos from Rhino, they will do a better job of audio mix."
2,nice xmas present,"very happy. it does what it says it will do. very easy and simple. only thing i could recommend, would be to include a cover with the kindle. i had to order and wait a week. i couldn't imagine taking it out with you without a cover."
2,"Interesting, lol","I feel a little messed up for finding the content intriguing, lol !Wonderfully well written, just like all of Anne's material."
2,"Screw 'Yojimbo"" - This is America!","I'm sick to death of hearing about some ... remake of a Japaneese ""Yojimbo.""This version, KICKED ...!Let me sum it up for you:Bad guy: ""I guess you'll have to kill me.""Willis: ""It'll hurt if I do...""Bullets and bad guys fly!What more do you need?Buy this quick!"
2,Laughed my ass off,"I saw the show in August, and I couldn't wait for the soundtrack to release. Has there ever been two better back-to-back comedy tunes than 'Everyone's a Little Bit Racist' and 'The Internet Is For Porn'? Some may think the show juvenile, but behind the laughs is a story that strikes closer to reality than most dramas. Buy one for yourself and one for all your friends."
2,another true report from a cured incurable melanoma patient,"a very well written book from a respectable source validating the awesome benefits of The Gerson Therapy and telling her personal battle with the ""black death"". I told some friends about this book and about Dr. Max Gerson. They reported back that they couldn't imagine a paperback for $67. Well folks try the Gerson Institute web site and buy one or a hundred at $12.95. There is no short supply!!!"
2,The Hollows Series,"There is never a dull moment in this series! This is a must read series for all who enjoy witches, vampires and more!"
2,Top Quality,Bought 16 of these glasses because I was tired of using chipped glasses and mixed match glasses. Had I'd known the quality of these. I wouldnt have purchased so many because these suckers will never chip or break unless I dropped them from my roof!They are a little on the heavy side but for the durability its well worth the weight! (no pun intended) I recieved them 2 days after ordered and the packaging is over and above its breaking point. I have 4 cats and a crazy little dog and now we dont have to worry about them knocking the glasses over.
2,A Must Read Book Before Getting Married,Don't let the title fool you. This book is great for anyone who is in a relationship.
2,Everything is all good,"This is such a love story. Never take a friendship as close as they were for granted. This movie is one of the best. Get the movie and see for yourself. I rate this movie with 5 star's. Also the soundtrack is off the hook. Puschase both the movie and soundtrack.Thank you,Shanell HARRIS"
2,A great book but not for beginners,"This book has probably kept more people from making a bamboo rod than any other work. It is a great book, just don't buy it thinking that it will teach you how to make one. It is not an instruction manual, but rather documentation of how Garrison made his rods. No question that Garrison set the standard for many aspects of rodmaking, but this is the book t0 read AFTER you read Maurer and Elser, or Cattanach, or The Lovely Reed."
2,An Iconic Show,"Truly and inconic part of the fifties, it is a enjoyable time to watch the episode that introduced ""Superman On Earth""."
2,Avid Gamer,"IF you enjoyed gauntlet legends, then you'll enjoy this game. Its an easy beat if you are a good gamer, but a lot of fun play time. Each level and boss get harder and harder, with an ultamite boss that is the end of the game. But with a four player option, and four different playable characters, along with four settings: easy, normal, hard and impossible, creates a great challenege. I haven't discovered any unlockables yet, which is always a nice plus, to unlock a character or bonus level. Overall, a good game to have to enjoy with a friend or on a down day."
2,"the slide sorter is fine, but don't buy suggested lamp or transformer!","I recently purchased the Logan Slide Sorter, which is fairly old tech, but very helpful in deciding which of the thousands of slides from my parents and my family that I want to scan and save to CD.I just wanted to warn other purchasers that the suggested Panavue Transformer and Panavue Replacement Lamp that are recommended on the Amazon site, to be purchased with the Logan Slide Sorter, are TOTALLY incompatible for the Logan Slide Sorter. Do not order them, or you will have to go through the hassle of not only returning them, but paying the return postage!"

2,Definitely worth the money.,"Solid, compact, and just the ticket if you're looking for an inexpensive red-dot laser sight.One definite positive is the sliding on/off switch, easy to flick on without having to stick your finger in between the trigger guard and the laser. Also no double stick tape or remote switch you have to worry about positioning, no wire to snag. I think it will also be less prone to accidental on/off switching while being carried or stored.I've got a lot of experience with lasers and there is very little off-axis light 'noise.' This means the maximum of the laser energy is devoted to the dot and not 'scatter.'"
2,Love this series,"We love True Blood, even when it gets a bit weird. The show is very addictive and season 4 left me wanting season 5 to be available!!"
2,Long Way Home CD Purchase,The product was easy to find. I like the ability to listen to tracks before purchasing. The CD came right on time and in perfect condition. I will not hesitate to buy CDs from this seller through Amazon again.
2,Art Rock from the Heart of the 80's,"Dif Juz apparently didn't remain together much longer after the release of the ""No Motion"" track which appeared on the 4AD compilation ""Lonely is an Eyesore"". This is truly unfortunate because the track reflects a band beginning to peak and show incredible promise.This album is entirely instrumental, comprising tracks from previous Dif Juz releases. Deceptively complex, the music lies somewhere between progressive rock and mid-career Cocteau Twins (or imagine a softer, dreamier version of Mogwai). For an album that is now 17 years old it has aged extremely well and still bears repeated listenings on my CD player. Highly recommended."
2,Awesome introduction to WPF and XAML,"Chris has done an excellent job of explaining WPF and drilling into common use scenarios. His explanations do a great job of show why to do things a certain way. For instance he explains that app developers are better served by using the Grid control rather than the canvas control in order to better support scaling of the user interface. As a developer for the VS Forms designer for WPF, I highly recommend this book for those wanting to learn this new technology."
2,You need one of these,If you're using a cast iron skillet you definitly need one of these. Much better than fumbling with a pot holder or an oven mitt.
2,soothing good tunes,"No surprises in this Ventura cd. All the charm he is famous for, is here. I am glad I bought quite a few way back when he was not yet a cult. Most of his cds are practically out of reach. I realized recently I have a real treasure in monetary terms with his cds! Whenever you find an affordable one, just get it!"
2,Serial cable,Extremely useful for the road. Required for some of the new keyboard accessories which don't include them.
2,Original HP,"Although I thought the time that it took the suppler to ship the product was a little slow, the product was as promised and in excellent condition. I do believe that the price for these HP image drums are high. But, I know that they work! I had to ""bite the bullet"" because I was replacing one of those re-conditioned image drums that I only got 2 months of life out of."
2,My three bunnies love it,My three rabbits just loved this when it came in the mail. I am trying to discourage furniture chewing so hopefully this will help. It was so popular with them I immediately ordered another!
2,But the Gemini Killer has been dead for 12 years...,"Legion is a great novel by the renowned author William Peter Blatty (made famous by his work ""The Exorcist""). The story picks up where the mystery of The Exorcist left off. Although it does not match up to the extreme heights, popularity, and intrest as The Exorcist, it is still worth reading.""Jesus asked the man his name, and he answered, 'Legion, for we are many.'"""
2,congratulation,A very knowledgeable book. After reading it you'll have an excellent overview of GPRS. Mr. Heine uses a lot of pictures and tables which illustrates the informations very well.
2,Works for me,I own an HP All-in-one printer and always run out of the black ink. This is by far a better alternative to buying the combo color-black since 90% of the documents I print are in black ink.
2,Classic Cut Trimmer,"The size is just right for our museum work room, however it slides a little as it is a lightweight trimmer. Maybe a rubber mat below it will hold better.Thanks, M"
2,Comfy & Sassy,"Falling just at the mid-rise, it holds in any unwanted bulge sightings...and stretchy just enough so it fits to a more slender leg/thigh. FINALLY, comfortable fit & fashion all in one!"
2,A Quick Read,"While this was a quick read and it held my interest, the story was more a litany of new and ever more outrageous forms of torture than a tale of adventure and romance. I hope the next volume is less macabre. My only other remark is that the cast is so huge its hard to keep track of who's who."
2,"Solid Prog, a few real gems in here","While Circus Maximus isn't exactly genre-busting or pushing progressive metal to new places, what they do, they do very well and sometimes that's more than enough. This album, like their other album Isolate, is not one that blew me away the first spin or two, but over time I've really come to appreciate the musicianship, quality of song writing/lyrics and even though they don't really take the genre anywhere new, it's a great album.I would say that this album isn't quite on par with Isolate, but has a few real gems on the album like ""Why am I here"", ""1st chapter"", and ""Glory of the Empire"". While it's true they aren't pushing boundaries like Suspyre on ""When Time Fades"" or Frost on ""Experiments"", they have no weaknesses either.Basically any fan of Dream Theater, Kamelot, Redepemtion or similar bands will find a lot to like here and this disc should end up earning a spot in your rotation after a few spins."
2,"Great, Imaginative Sci-Fi Novel","I'm not what you would call a huge fan of science fiction, but I found Coyote to be a compelling, interesting read. Coyote is a moon of a planet in a solar system many light-years from Earth. The action in the novel takes place well in the future, when the world has drastically changed. The U.S. is no longer, and what is in its place is particularly unappealing. The starship Alabama is about to launch when it is hijacked by its own crew filled with, instead of the intended party loyalists, social dissidents. The successfully make it to Coyote (and Steele gets them there with some imaginative sci-fi creations) and form the rudiments of a society. They ultimately have contact with earth again, but it is not the earth they left. Coyote is a very readable, very enjoyable sci-fi novel. Have fun."
2,A simple yet VERY worth-while book,"Not only do I find this book relatively easy to understand, but Carolyn gives real-world examples to support her theories and ideas. I am currently at her treatment center in Malibu and this book has not only enlightened me on eating disorders, but it has also aided me to comprehend what my parents and loved ones are going through and how the eating disorder affects them. I highly recommend this book!"
2,Have to ask one question...,Does this set include six movies or only five? In all of this excitement I kind of lost track myself.
2,Mamma Mia?,"This review will be very short. ""Mamma Mia"" is a fine movie, but do me a favor, please find/buy/rent a copy of ""Muriel's Wedding"" wedding (heck, even look at the cover of the DVD first and you'll see what I mean).The common theme here seems to be (some of) the music of Abba.4 stars for Mamma Mia4 stars for Muriel's WeddingBe warned, Muriel's Wedding is 'different' as Australian comedies go..."
2,Reebok NFL Equipment Hoodie,This is the most comfortable sweatshirt I have ever owned and the fleece lining will keep you warm even in the wind and rain (which I found out at the Baltimore Ravens stadium).
2,"If you want to grow, read this!","If you are looking for meat and not milk, Rick Joyner has written the book for you. This book will challenge and draw you to honestly face and deal with your weaknesses, help you prepare for difficult days to come, and encourage you to turn your eyes to Jesus and follow Him faithfully. Only those serious about growing need open its pages."
2,Am thinking of buying another set!,"I purchased this for my annual Fall Festival and the kids LOVED it. Even the older (12-15 yrs) ones had a blast with them! I actually had a hard time getting them to move on to the next game! Am thinking of buying another set so I can have more than 4 compete at a time! Wonderful product, well made, and well worth the money!"
2,AMAZING,VERY GOOD AND CREEPY I IMAGINE ITS JASON AND JUST PRETEND THE MASK RIPPING ISNT RTHERE THE ACTORS ARE GREAT ESPECIALY TIFFANY HEALM AND THE GIRL WHO PLAYS OPAM ROBINS GREAT TOO VERY GOREY CREEPY EVEN A INCH SCARY

2,Eureka Lightspeed vaccum,"I used this vacuum before this has an excellent dirt suction capacity, brush roll broke so i search for the new vaccum, but i feel this vacuum is great price deal than other vacuum has. and great too. i go with this again.."
2,chris benoit,let me say that i'm not a huge benoit fan but I respect him and eddie. Lately they have grown on me and I decided to check this dvd out. It is pretty damn good the dvd extras really make it worth it he has some good matches although i wish the 2outof3 falls with kurt was on here.I would recomend this its better than the mick foley one and thats sad to say cuz hes my favorite entertainer and i think the wwe screwed him over by picking average matches.
2,Good primer,A nice little primer on how to dig up artifacts from the past with special emphasis on the area just East of the Mediterranean.
2,The Perfect Shoes,"My mom actually bought these shoes for my daughter. She found them while browsing children's shoes online. They're cute online, but they are even cuter in person. They fit my daughter well and just look so comfortable. The brown goes with most of her outfits and the cutouts give it such a sweet, delicate look. She was wearing them when she first learned to walk at almost 11 months old and these easily gave her the support she needed. I get comments from people all of the time when she has them on about how precious they are. People are always asking me where they can buy a pair. I love these shoes!!!!"
2,Relentlessly Truthful,"This accurate, thoroughly researched account of the mis-handling of justice in a small town in Arkansas is a must read for anyone who has ever felt like an outsider in their neighborhood. It's not only accurate and well written, it's also as good a nail-biter crime drama as you're likely to find. Mara Leveritt's even hand perfectly lays out these hard to believe events and draws you in to a community full of secrets and cover-ups. I loved this book as much as I hate the fact that these boys (who are now men) are still in prison. Damien Echols has become a good friend of mine and I know he will be vindicated. Please read this book!-Eddie Spaghetti, The SUPERSUCKERS"
2,They're Good Seeds.,"These Flaxseeds are of good quality, I eat them daily. Bought the whole seed, rather than the ground seed, because of the better nutritional value of grinding your own. Will buy again. I read that whole seeds can pass undigested, and that ground seeds can loose their nutritional value over time. So we grind a week's worth at a time. Best used in oatmeal as the flavors blend well. Or in a cold cereal, or added to a cup of coffee for a twist. Seem to blend better in hot foods."
2,"A Great Book, But Expensive and Difficult in High School","I used the third edition of this book, it was only one volume covering from clonial age to the first election of Clinton. This was the book assigned to my high school and AP history class (my setup was weird 4 periods a week of standard High School history, and 2 a week of AP level history). This book prepared me really well for the AP US Exam, while I have not yet received my score, I am very confident I knew the material well. This book also really helped me for the SAT Subject Test: US History, on which I scored a 96th percentile 780. While this book is good for intense history courses, I believe it is too hard for a standard high school level US History course. This is because it covers too much material for that type of class. This book is very well written, and at times can often be interesting to read, what other text books can say that."
2,Easy and Quick,"I wanted to use the pump for a while before writing a review. My daughter is two months old now, and I have been using it nearly everyday, so that I can finish my last semester at college and leave her with a babysitter. It is quick, breaks down into smaller parts for putting in my backpack, and it doesn't hurt. The only that I don't like is that the clear tube sometimes gets foggy from the heat of the breastmilk, and you can't see if any milk is getting into the pump. When that happens I just wipe inside the neck of the pump, and it's perfect again! I recommend this for students and moms who need to pump at work."
2,Reviewer: Big Zach! NOT A KIDS REVIEW! although a kid.,This movie is Awesome! I love it so much it is very dark and action packed! It has a very great story and an excellent ending! The third best batman movie and one of the best superhero movies ever. I am a huge fan of Tim Burton and he this is one of his greatest films! The actors were great escpecially Danny Devito he was Perfect it was like he knew everything about the penguin! Michelle Pfeifer was great also she was everything a catwoman should have.
2,takuya's review,"I am a Japanese university student and I watched the prison episode of '30 days'in my English class. Morgan entered in American prizon 30 days. He was talking with many prisoners and make many friends.But most his friends were drug addicts.A man went out from prison,but he came back prison soon.I thought this show is interesting.Because I could see realistic prisoner's life.But I think not better that take prisoner's face.I would recommend this show because I understood prisoner's life."
2,Does the Job,"I like this Bible because it stands up to being tossed in a backpack or a cargo pocket well. That is the main selling point of this one for me--durability. I also really like the NLT for readability and ease of understanding.Only negatives are the print is a little small (but not overly so.) and flipping to passages is a little bit of a trick since the metal edges of the cover make it a little tougher to get your finger in next to the pages.The cover is cool, and is a conversation starter."
2,"like, wow!","We've thoroughly enjoyed this collection! Our kids beg to watch and we don't mind one bit--it's fun to revisit those memories of after school TV and they're good, clean shows. I highly recommend this collection."
2,good insights,"Lots of thot provoking good insights. Another that should be in all Christian library's. Frank has done his homework and hats off to the publisher for the brave move. Viola has studied church history and makes great observations but in my opinion, occasionally pushes scripture too far to validate said points, but to write off the whole book for a couple of instances of rigidity would be a big mistake."
2,Fiskars 12-foot Pruning Saw,"I bought the pruning saw with an extra blade, figured I'd save myself a trip to Ace for one but haven't needed to use it yet. The saw works well with live branches, but will just rub on dry dead ones, so it's effectiveness depends on your project. If you're getting a pruning saw I'd recommend this one."
2,"Swift Transaction, prompt delivery A+++","Exactly what I wanted and exactly the price, I'm more than satisfied with the product, service and speed of delivery. Thanks."
2,I have tried several off brands and they don't stack up with factory cartridges.,I have spent over 2 hours filling out how I rate products that I bought through the last year or so and then you have to have 20 more words in order for me to submit my ratting. This is it.
2,Siemens System--State of the Art in DECT Cordless,Siemens ten-year track record of marketing these phone systems in Europe shows. The reception is clear. The design is clean and the phone is easy to use. The answer system works reliably. The directions for use and programming are straight forward. Definitely worth the price.
2,Great rack but the cover is TERRIBLE!,"I just set up the rack and I am pretty happy with it. It took about 25 minutes to assemble and it seems to be of good quality. Unlike some other reviews here, mine did come with the branded Landmann end rails and a very nice finish. The packaging was very good as well. It easily holds a face cord of firewood and looks great!As others mentioned, DO NOT GET THE COVER! I got it only because the price with cover was cheaper than the price without. The cover is so terrible, though. It ripped in about 10 different places the first time I put it onto the rack. Each of the ties ripped off of the cover as I was tightening them and then the cover started to rip in other places as well. I immediately removed it and threw it in the trashcan. It's so bad!"
2,A MUST HAVE FOR EVERYONE!!!,"This is by far the BEST CD I have ever owned. Normally, I buy a CD because I like a tune or two that I hear on the radio. Well, when I bought this one, I was pleasantly surprised. Not only do I enjoy EVERY track on this CD, but it stays in my car and I just play it over and over and over again. This is a top-notch band! This is a group that everyone can enjoy! What are you waiting for? Get this CD!!"
2,One of the best Dating books I've read,"I've read through piles of books on dating and relationships, and this book packs the most bang for the buck. Whenever a book makes a strong statement which is undoubtedly true, I highlight it in yellow. This book had a lot of yellow in it by the time I was done reading it. The tag-team authorship is well educated, and at the same time easy to read. I recommend it to anyone that has worried about issues in dating, relating, and mating."
2,"Come on, people, it's not that bad!","I must admit I went in hating this show before I even saw it. Some of the character designs still make me cringe, but overall the show has grown on me. Give it a chance before you diss it.And if you still don't like it, go watch TAS. Which this show is not, nor does it ever claim to be. It's a re-imagining of the character, like Smallville. Rate it on its own merits, not in comparison to anything else."
2,Great Comedy Series...but HORRIBLE DVD transfer quality,"A great comedy series like WINGS deserves a better release than this.The Video Quality is blurry, washed out and very fuzzy.Unlike HOGANS HEROES and other CBS/Paramount TV series that have finally been released on DVD lately with EXCELLENT video quality... it appears they used some low quality prints or even VHS copies of old shows to make the DVD transfers here on WINGS.I give the series 10 stars !!! but the poor DVD transfer lowers the rating to a 4 since they are hard to watch with this substandard release."
2,vintage Heyer,If you like Georgette Heyer -- you will like Devil's Cub. It is vintage Heyer. Period perfect and captivating characters interacting in a tongue-in-cheek drama.
2,Good grammar guide,This book is handy because it covers grammar principals at the basic conversational level and includes English translations.
2,good!!,"I read it before the ancient aliens tv show. If you like ancient civilizations, Atlantis, ancient technology and myths youe will like this book."
2,SF Travelogue,"Nasir says ""...as a native Arab I had found most sf portrayals of theMiddle East to be the most astonishing malarkey. I wanted to write about the region as it really is: hot, jostling, ancient, and human-intense, and about the luminous inner awareness awakened by its blinding days and jasmine nights, its silent ruins baking the stillness of orange groves.""The story begins in a simple hut on the Jordan River. Blaine Ramsey is a""digger"" who prospects for compelling subconscious images for use inadvertising. He finds his dreams and even his days haunted by an Egyptian film goddess. He travels to Cairo to pursue his vision.The mystery of Ramsey's goddess/actress is revealed, if not explained,against the exotic, tumultuous Cairo urban landscape. For readers of American science fiction, Jamil Nasir's travelogue in this book should be as strange and exciting as any trip to an alien planet."
2,"It's not nice to carp, but..","...the reviewer who gave this astonishing performance three stars because the Adagio movement lacked mystique may lead one to think that Boulez has replace Bruckner's spirit with his own. Actually, that's true, for his version of the Adagio is strcutrually clear, precise, and without much rubato to underline emotion. But for some reason this turns out to be alchemy--the Adagio is one of the greatest things about Boulez's reading.But, then, I should disclose that my Bruckner collection is full of Karajan and Giulini and bare of Wand, Jochum, or Hiatink, all of whome this reviewer extols for mystrique. I find all three flat (even though Haitink performed a wonderful Bruckner Seventh with the BSO in recent seasons and an equaly superb Eighth with the Vinnea Phil in Carnegie Hall)."
2,A Good Radio...,"I recently bought and installed this radio in my truck, and I have not had any problems yet!!! A few minor details are the noise blanker seems really sesitive (sometimes when it is on I do not receive any traffic) but that is about it. I enjoy Cobra products, this is my second radio (I just traded up from a 25NWXT), I have a Cobra HG2000 Antenna, and I am waiting on a Cobra Mic for my radio. So far no problems with any of it and I hope to have none down the road!!!!!"
2,Simply the best sunny day driving music,"this cd is great! i love to listen to it on a sunny weekend afternoon while driving. it's the type of music that is best listened to while driving a Mercedes-Benz. my personal favorite is Beach Combing whose deep bass outperforms some of the bass cd's released by hip-hop artists. if you listen to the the preview of some of th esongs, i guarantee that you will love it."
2,For Master Craftsmen,"This book is mostly over my head, but it goes a long way to satisfy my curiosity about the mystery of the Japanese house, specifically, the wonderful sliding screens that tranform spaces and make them more fluid. I especially like the fact that the author talks a lot about his apprentice years, even down to the tools he received and the sorts of jobs he was expected to do. In the U.S., houses aren't built with this blend of art & science, but I think that may change as people become more unhappy with the slapped-together, junk-wood and drywall method of home building. MAKING SHOJI is probably not for the Black & Dekker crowd, but carpenters and other curious folk will find it very interesting."
2,COMFORTABLE MUTIMEDIA MOUSE WITH STEEP PRICE TAG,"PROS: VERY CONFORTABLE HUMAN ALGORITHMIC SHAPE, THE BUTTONS DURABILITY I GIVE 7/10.CONS: NEED 2 BATTERIES TO WORK WHICH IS NOT GOOD,CAUSE BATTERIES ARE HEAVY(ADD WIEGHT TO MOUSE OVERALL MASS,EXPENSIVE, AND NOT GOOD FOR ENVIRMENT!!!. rEACTION TIME IS NOT BUILD FOR GAMERS,OVERALL I GIVE 8/10, IF YOU DONT PLAY GAMES AND LIKE WIRELESS MOUSE THIS IS AN OK CHOICE."
2,Reliving my youth,"This is an excellent book written by an author who is my age, and who, like me, lived in West Berlin during the second world war. The story provides an accurate account of the conditions in Berlin during the war, and of the friendship shared between the American soldiers (who we all admired) and the Berliners. It will be of great value to those interested in the historical aspects of the story, as well as to those who want a real page-turner about a young girl's perspectives on living through the war and how she and her family were able to cope through such a devastating time. A wonderful story which recounts the developmnt of a relationship between a young girl from Berlin and an American soldier who become separated by the battles of war, only to be brought back together again by fate. The ending is sure to be remembered by anyone fortunate enough to read this accurate description of our history and that of the young girl who is at its center. An excellent yarn."
2,For hard core action fans.,"This is one for the hard core action fans. There's very little 'down time' to run for popcorn. If someone isn't getting shot, punched, etc. things are getting blown up or sunk in water. There is an action scene I haven't seen yet with a police car. Several of the action scenes are worth a rewind and I did appreciate the 'buff bodies'. You have to give these guys an A plus for working out.Chrissy K. McVay - Author"
2,Brilliantly acted and beautifully told,"Having never seen a Brad Pitt movie, Meet Joe Black took me by surprise. The chemistry between Brad Pitt and Claire Forlani was more powerful than any I've ever seen. It was amazing that Brad Pitt could play DEATH with such an air of innocence. The peanut butter scene had me in stitches. The love evident between Death and Susan jumped off the screen making the final scene at the birthday party when Susan realized who Joe was all the more heartbreaking. Overall MJB was incredible."
2,One of the best books I have read this year,I just finished Jewels of the Sun and loved it. I couldn't put it down. You really had the feel that you were in Ireland. I loved the idea of the faries. One of her best yet. Can not wait for Shawn and Darcy's stories.
2,Cards to keep,I really enjoyed the mythic tarot cards. I look at many of them and can intuitively say atleast one word for each. The book gives great meanings if you can understand it. I would say keep the cards and the book.....then look for another book more user friendly and come back to your previous book.
2,"Thorough, Balanced and Full of Information","I use this commentary to write a Sunday School lesson plan. It is a wonderful reference, and although he presents his views and reasoning it is balanced enough to let you do your own thinking."
2,Very helpful learning tool,"I purchased this bulletin board set for my beginner piano students who need extra help with learning the notes. the charts are clear, colorful, and durable. Also they attach easily to a door or painted wall with tacky gum so they can be repositioned as often as necessary. My students use the notation charts all the time. As for the musical symbols...not so much but are still nice to have on display. The wipe off staff charts are great. You can cut them to size if you want for smaller practice boards. I have even had adult students comment on these charts. Definitely worth the buy"
2,Good Bits,Used them on some small woodworking projects and they work fine. Will let u know more when i have used them extensively. For the price its still a great deal
2,Awesome Underground Hip-Hop,Sharkey's Machine is one of the best albums I have heard in a long time. It is contains some of the best MC's and the music is a flavor that is universal. Positive lyrics and music that is new and fresh make this a must have. You will not be disappointed.
2,Yep Yep!!,"I am 53 overweight couch potato ! I have tried every diet every exercise video! Most videos are to hard for older people! people! Bought this one as I am also doing Bistro meal plan diet ! LOVE LOVE them both! Go Richard, love how it has actual overweight people instead of perky skinny people!! Great video still today!!"
2,An absolute must,"Over 300 GPS units were stolen from my community last year, including mine. I'd left it attached to the windshield out of convenience. I left work one evening and found the passenger window smashed out and the GPS gone. The police said that windshield suction mounts are too big of a temptation for thieves to pass up.I purchased a new Garmin and this mount and it could not be easier. It sits on the dashboard like a bean bag and I move it to the best position for me to view. It only slides if I really hit the breaks hard. When I want to hide the unit I simply pick it up and put it on the floor. No one would ever know I have a GPS unit. Well worth the money."
2,Awesome Book!!!,"As an entrepreneur, I just love Mr. Trump - this book is great, it teaches you the path (indirectly, you have to listen!) in which a billionaire thinks, and informs you - that to reach the top, it doesn't matter what people tell you your ""chances are"", if you believe your ""chances"" ,then you have little possibility of success anyway.Good tips and guidance, benefited me during some injurious times...a recommended volume to all you Trump enthusiasts, or people who just wish to discover more about prosperity and ""thinking rich"".Thank you Donald Trump, for this amazing work."
2,Good kit for the price,"I've installed several of these types of wire kits for sub amp installation over the years and all were pretty much the same. This kit has good quality wire and connectors, maybe a little better than another brand I've used. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I feel that the 100A fuse holder was a little cheap made but it appears to be adequate and seems to work ok. Good product and good price."
2,An Underrated Gem,"An enjoyable album, with expert production by Rupert Hine. Some nice songs such as Break the Chain, World of Mirrors, The Low Hum of Machines, and the remarkable Love Changes This. Very life-affirming music, though I am not entirely sure that the band had all that much to say beyond relatively obvious observations. As I implied, it's not a very challenging album, though I suspect that that wasn't the point, and would probably distract. One By One By One (named from a lyric from Break the Chain) is a good listen, and that's what it's all about."
2,Fallen Angel!,"Reviewing this work in itself is going to be a spoiler for future readers, so let me keep my posting as succint as possible:1. It is one of the finest pastiches that I have come across, with an element of honesty that tends to envelope you.2. It is a very painful work that saddens you to an extent that I considered impossible, before reading this work.3. Read it, but don't lose faith. If the Church can survive the entire gamut of conspiracy theories, we can also survive."
2,Good product,5 StarsFirst of this is a must have if you have a brushless Rc car. If you are doing wheelies all the time and cant keep on the ground this is what you are looking for. This will protect your back end of the motor from hits and scratches. MUST HAVE.
2,Unsinkable Molly Brown CD,"I received the CD much sooner than expected. It arrived in good condition, and I am very pleased with the sound. I believe this was my first purchase from Amazon, but it won't be my last. It was nice shopping without having to leave the house, particularly since this is an old recording, and I was unable to locate it at any local music store. I intend to broaden the scope of my purchases in the future."
2,Rich and rewarding experience,With so much mediocre music flooding our lives today it's delightful to be able to retrieve gems like this. Those thick rich analogue synth sounds come out so beautifully on modern equipment. Jan Hammer still stands tall with this lovely early work
2,They keep getting better.,"Although the Filmore concerts will never be topped, this live set from the best live band ever is as good as it gets.I hope the Allman Brothers road does go on forever."

2,english translation,"very good book.it is enjoiable to the reader and gives first hand info about tibet and surroundings .but there is but: its translations in english is execrable, dissastrous, shamefull; how can u say quote : 'rimpoche, now five and twenty years old' ???? besides this the whole book is full of clear german phrase organizaton; gramar mistakes and german sentence structures with english words.the publishers and translator whom i do not give the honnor of naming should be ashamed they sell such abbominations"
2,Great but not as good as the first book,At first it took time to get into this book but after a few chapters I couldn't put it down! I couldn't wait to continue on to the third book in this ! Keep reading it is worth it :)
2,Love The Replacements?,Then you'll love this DVD. The documentary was made by someone who is a great fan of the band and took time and care to show you The Replacements. I have been waiting to see this forever and it never screened in my town so I pre-ordered it and I am glad I did. Anyone who is into the band would love to have this in their collection.
2,The Black Cauldron (Disney Gold Classic Collection),This is an amazing Disney film. The whole family will love it. I'm always amazed by this films history as it is one of the best Disney animations of all time!
2,Great Pump,"Great pump. I am using this pump and a $4 diverter valve to replace two other pumps that were each more expensive than this pump. It is driving two water features (a column with about a 4' lift/carry, and a spitter) with power to spare. Outside use only as it is not unusually loud, but not quiet.I agonized for weeks over which pump to get, don't do that. Just buy this one."
2,Now That's REALLY What I Call VERY Good Music!,"~The first thing I have to say is- THIS ALBEM ROCKS! Out of 20 hit songs, only about 2 of them I don't like that much. But they're not THAT bad... they are Usher-U Got It Bad, and Mandy Moore-Crush. I WOULD tell you my most favorite songs on this albem, but 18 of them are my favorites! I listen to this CD non-stop! It's great to listen to if you are bored, on the computer or reading, or just wanna party with your best friends! I HIGHLY reccomend this CD for anyone that wants to listen to some really good, variable, dancable, very-good-beat-and-lyrics songs! There is a wide variety of music on this CD- R&B, pop, rap rock, alternative, hip-hop, and dance tunes. So it's sure gotta be good-& it is!! I have to tell ya, this is the best NOW! albem EVER!! Go out & buy it!! You should be satisfied!! :)~"
2,Excellent For Computers!!!,"I like the Swiffer dusters, for keeping my computer, keypad, printer, and my computer desk, dust free. I keep one handy by the computer."
2,Good quick reference,"This book is a good reference for experienced C# programmers, or for those who know a related C syntax language who want an intro to the language without reading 200 pages of ""what is a variable"" and ""why use loops"" and other newbie stuff. Warning-It is a reference to the C# language, it barley touches on the .net class libraries at all. So if you need info on the datagrid, you are out of luck. Great book"
2,not as bad as the critics said,"this is not an awful movie, it's quite funny at some momments...it's not boring at all...i recomend it for some kids... specially girls, u r gonna luv this"
2,A Good Shooter,"The Kyocera / Yashica T4 Zoom is a well-made, handsome and very compact zoom film camera. The lens has above-average sharpness and photos taken with this camera show little or no vignetting, a problem typical of these cameras. The camera is very easy to use and, although its small size makes for tiny controls, it's not hard to use. Color saturation is very good and contrast isn't bad, but photos may be overall a bit dark because of the slow lens speeds. My only complaint is that, at wide-angle settings, the flash isn't very powerful, but it's acceptable at close-up range. This camera probably won't take photos that are as sharp as those taken by a single focal length camera (like the Olympus Stylus Epic with an f2.8 lens -- sharper than the original T4? Maybe!), but for a zoom camera it produces quality results."
2,Akai 20 inch tv with side slot dvd,We love the tv but sometimes we have a problem getting aa dvd to eject.Other wise it is great. any suggestions?
2,Informative,"If you are at all considering filing bankruptcy, you should read this book. It is a great guide that is not only informative, but easy to read. The step-by--step instructions will help you wade through the process. Definitely user-friendly."
2,WALL*E is a winner - a must-see film for anyone & everyone,"WALL*E is a simple yet charming & enjoyable story. Truly wonderful & skilled filmmaking from the mind of director & co-writer Andrew Stanton (Finding Nemo also), as shown by how much emotion and heartfelt moments can be conveyed with such little dialogue. WALL*E reminded me a lot of E.T, with his curious look at the world & his heart of gold. Along with stunning visuals (especially the large vistas), WALL*E is another more than solid Pixar film. Without a doubt, I anticipate it will bag the 2009 Academy Award for Best Animated Film."
2,THIS MAN KNOWS HOW TO KEEP YOU UP ALL NIGHT,"I read this book with trepidation. Recently having read my first Harlan Coben book Tell No One and recommending it to everyone, I feared my initial enthusiasm might be in vain. My worry was unfounded. Again Mr. Coben proves he knows how to grab you and not let go until the rollercoaster ride has mercifully ended. What a storyteller!"
2,Great to use and to store,"These were purchased for my cat (who has an aversion to kitty litter - Oh joy). The good news is they fit into the tray that secures these pads for puppy training. They hold a good amount of urine. So far they have not ripped when the cat scratches to ""dig"".Advantages over the others I bought in the same order:1- These are packed tightly (vacuum packed) and are thin. So the pads mailed neatly in a sturdy, stable box, and they are easy to store for the same reason.2- These were wrapped in plastic and kept clean during shipping. The other brand's box tore during shipping, exposing the pads to dirt, etc.These are on my list for reorder when needed."
2,I love Jill Stengl,"Polly dreams of marriage with a man she can respect, but two men dream of marriage to Polly. Lieutenant Kevin Morris possesses undenible charisma and stunning good looks, but to Polly his morals dont exactly match his proffesed faith. Air Force Strike Eagle pilot Peter Shackleton, through not as physically attractive, is a true man of God.But when Peter is deployed to Turkey,Polly begins to doubt her future role as a military wife. Can Peter and Polly get through their problems and look to the future. I love this author and this book is great."
2,best to watch all three,"I recently watched all three of these movies (Dracula 2000, Dracula II, Dracula III: Legacy) and liked them all very much.I'm not sure that II and III can be completely appreciated without seeing the other chapters but they all make for one of the best modern horror movie series."
2,Remembering...,"Great reading! Many childhood memories flooded back. Being free and safe to roam acres of woods at will is a liberty that my children have missed. The conflicts, and more important, the strength of family runs strong in ""Lesson of the Harvest"". I was so caught up in the story that I read cover to cover in one sitting. Can't wait for the next one!"
2,Daughter is very pleased,"My daughter had me order this CD two weeks before it came out and is very pleased with it. The first few weeks she had it I would hear the radio in her room playing very loud, and with out doubt. She loves the CD I got for her."
2,Get this wonderful soundtrack today!,Just because this CD cover has a couple of cartoon Dinosoras on the cover dosen't mean this is one dumb CD. The music is beautiful. I recommend that you get this when you can. This CD is one you will enjoy listening to over & over again! :)
2,Love it!,"I seriously considered not purchasing this item because of the negative reviews. However, it was the BIG ITEM on my 4 y/o son's Christmas list. I didn't want him to be disappointed that Santa didn't bring his Polar Express train, so I reluctantly purchased it. Boy, was I pleasantly surprised! Santa really delivered. This train is beautiful! Everything my little guy was dreaming of. It comes in an easy to unpack/re-pack box that is great for putting it away during non-play time. It is sturdy and easy to assemble. It is easy to control. Most importantly, it is absolutely charming with great details. I'm not sure what went wrong with the folks who gave negative reviews, possibly wrong expectations. However, I must say that the item description covers it well. If you're looking for a Polar Express train lovely enough to collect, but simple, sturdy, and inexpensive enough to give to a child, look no further."
2,Not Bad,"Does what it says... Howard Stern comes in nice and clear now! :-)I agree that the FM transmitter is a bit weak. Of course, using the FM transmitter has other problems as well since you need to keep finding channels that don't get any interference as you drive around. Solution? Do yourself a favor... if your car does not have an AUX IN port (obviously it does not if you are using the FM transmitter feature)... USE AN FM MODULATOR. I purchased a wired FM modulator, a GLI (ground loop interrupt) and the required cables (including some special antenna adaptor cables for a Subaru) for about $75. I spent about 3 hours installing it... an now I have a mini-jack connection to my radio... no more interference from any radio station... crystal clear connection... and the bonus is that I can plug my iPod into it as well!Google up ""scoshe FM modulator"" and you will get the idea."
2,.,"Great series, I've been reading them from the first one out. I can't wait for the next one to come out"
2,Absolutely Dolly!,Fun & entertaining. Dolly & Burt fans will enjoy this movie. Not kid friendly; but adult humor abounds! The songs will stick in your brain & you'll have to sing along.
2,"Great, but not perfect","A little too extreme for me. They could have decreased the importance of sex and drugs quite a bit and still the idea would have been great and the movie would have joined a wider category of people. I still loved it. I mean, the scenario was great and the end was not too cocky. I especially loved to watch Witherspoon. We could feel that she really believed in her character and did a great play. However, Gellar is so mean and wild, her play sometimes gets confusing and we feel that it's not really her.It was a great idea to introduce a totally new aspect of sex in this movie. This movie finally shows that if you really love someone, you're gonna stick with him or her, no matter how many partners you had before, because ""love has its reasons that reason ignores""."
2,regarding Dole... might be a reason he was not included...,"I agree that Dole's absence is curious, and if done for political reasons, unpleasant. However, Dole apparently joined 10th Mountain in Feb. 1945 and didn't undergo the training in the Colorado Rockies that most of this film is focused on (http://www.life.com/Life/lifebooks/military/intro.html). That might be why the movie didn't interview him -- only talking with either the filmmakers or Dole himself will settle the question.Anyhow, about the movie -- it's good enough, I suppose. The use of a harmonica during some of the narration is hokey, but tolerable. I wish there was more discussion of how all that training specifically came in handy; I wish there were more war stories here period. Otherwise the film just comes across as a bunch of guys having fun until late in the war, while other soldiers are fighting and dying."
2,Great for what you pay for them!,"I have friends with the Bose versions and these sound almost as good at less than half the price. My only complaint is that they are ackward if you pull them off for a moment and try to put them on your neck. For example, when you are boarding the plane or when you have to talk to the flight attendant for a minute. The battery life on the noise cancellation is EXCELLENT! One AAA battery has lasted for over 24 hours so far. I only wear them when I am flying."
2,First rate!,"There are a number of good method books for the jazz bassist these days- I must own at least a dozen! But Hungerford's book is one of the best. Unlike some authors, Hungerford doesn't start you off playing root-root-root or root-fifth-root-fifth. He assumes you want to learn to play real bass lines, and that's exactly what he gives you. From the beginning he has the reader building lines with roots, 3rds, 5th, 6ths and 7ths; from there, he moves quickly into I-IVs, rhythm changes and II-V-Is in various keys. There's also an accompanying CD to provide rhythmic and harmonic accomaniment to the excercises.The second half of the book takes the reader through a number of standard tunes, some with bass lines written out and some provided for the reader to write their own lines using the guidelines given. There's a lot of information packed into less than 100 pages here, and a diligent player will find all they need for a solid progam of jazz education."
2,Why She Married Him,"A lot of fun. Great historical detail. I learned a lot about a time and place I had always been interested in. The novel moves backward, so the farther you go along, the more you realize why the heroine is bound to make the choices she does. As we all are."
2,I love Shrek!,"If you have seen all the other Shrek movies and are a fan, then you won`t be disappointed. Practically laughed the whole way through it! I highly recommend this movie!"
2,Nice gift,"The child I got this for said she made a big mess but she loved it. It seemed to be more about the mess and ""spa"" idea than the science."
2,one of the best nailers,"I work on a framing crew of a couple guys. We have tried several different brands of nail guns- hitachi, dewalt, and others, but this has been the gun we all agree is the best. Some brands may be slightly lighter, but with the rafter hook, round head capacity and power that this has it's a winner. We push our tools, and other brands couldn't take it- my gun has been going 3 1/2 years, and aside from from a few minor repairs it has run well."
2,Jay's Dopest Release.,"This is one of the greatest hip-hop albums concieved in a long time. Jay raises the bar for lyricists and emcees will have to worker harder on their flow if they will ever reach the pinnacle that Jay is at.My favorite joint is ""Take Over"", besides 2Pac's ""Hit Em Up"", this is the hardest diss song ever.Other hot ones include ""Renegade"", ""Ain't No Love"", ""Hola Hovito"", and ""That ... Jigga.This album has everything that a classic album should. Pick it up as soon as possible."
2,History and Art,We really liked this book. It is a biography of Grandma Moses' life. She was always interested in painting but really did not get to do too much until late in her life. We read this book for reading but would also make a good history book for the late 1800 - early 1900. It could also be used for art. She did not use expensive materials in her art and she painted the life she knew. Could be followed by an art project. Recommended for ages 6-10 years.
2,Essential Reading,"If you're a parent of a drug/alcohol abuser, stop what you're doing and read this book. You won't want to put it down. You'll find yourself underlining statements to go back to as reminders of what to do and what not to do. You may regret killing yourself by wishful thinking and enabling behavior, but this book is not about blaming parents; it's all about healing parents. The focus is arming one's self against the manipulation, freeing one's self from the abuse, and recovering from the pain. The hardest lessons of the book are to disengage to learn not get conned, to learn to say ""no"" to kids who belong to their addiction, who long ago stopped being your kids. This is a well-written book and every page will have you nodding your head in agreement. You may only regret not discovering it years ago. Pure wisdom."
2,Good Book,"When this book came out, it was the best primer on Healthy Homes/Multiple Chemical Sensitivity. It is easy to read and covers most of the important stuff. John Bower has learned by doing.He is one of the better authors covering home ventilation. On the down side, there are some vague referances not backed up with objective data.All in all, well worth the money."
2,show some respect,"Although this might not be where afi started, and i agree they have better albums, to anyone who trashes this cd may u die a slow and painful death. No person could honestly bash afi, everyone has their own tastes and i understand if someone didn't like afi, and thats fine..... but selling themselves short cmon"
2,Enjoyable and fast paced read,"I enjoyed the imaginative way that the author presented the background of the story, and the characters that she developed. The story is fast paced, and draws you in, but some of the characters are a little forced, and parts of the story are a little too far fetched. However, i still found the book enjoyable and worth the time / money invested."
2,"You say toy, I say learning tool.","I purchased this product to use as a training tool for adult education. It is great for teaching problem solving, teambuilding and Lean manufacturing princples such as pull systems and cellular manufacturing.The pieces are durable and because they are magnetic, they can be used in a variety of ways. All it takes is a little imagination."
2,A good album for the Puddle of Mudd fan,"This is my third album from Puddle of Mudd and it sounds great (somehow I missed the initial release of this album). I would recommend it to any current Puddle of Mudd fan, but newcomers to their music should definitely listen to the ""Blurry"" album first since I think that album includes their best work to date."
2,Will and Grace Rocks,"I love Will and Grace....They are so funny, the last season is a bit sad knowing that the final is coming but with Will, Grace, Jack and Karen you can't go wrong."
2,Excellent Album,"I'm a big fan of the Ultra album. I stopped listening to Depeche a year or so after Violator (which is actually probably my favorite album of them all), but I started listening again when Ultra came out. It's typical Depeche Mode. By that, I don't mean that it sounds exactly like anything from the previous albums. I mean that this cd contains tracks with varying tempo, sound, emotion, etc. Each track is great in it's own way. I'm particularly fond of Barrel of a Gun, Home, It's no good (great video, by the way), Uselesss, and Sister of night."
2,Sips of heaven,"Do you love the charred flavor of Starbucks at $4 a pop for a thimbleful of overpriced swill? Then you'll feel like a Mensa genius after trying Lavazza Crema e Aroma Beans. This price is genuinely a bargain if you shop around the internet. Even if you're using a $20 grinder with a whirly bird blade and a Sam's Club espresso machine, your toes will curl with a brew of these beans. No I don't work for these guys. But if you really love your morning espresso or cappuccino smooth and hearty you'll love Lavazza. Just be prepared for friends start dropping by and mooching a fix once word gets out."
2,The best fun you can have with a one dollar bill!,"I bought this for my son. We made a number of these together. However, you do have to really study the diagrams. Some of these are almost impossible to make if you are the ""average"" origami buff like we are. However, overall, we had a lot of fun constructing these. They make wonderful gifts in lieu of simply stuffing some money into a card."
2,Funny and B R I L L I A N T!,"Oh yes this movie is not to be missed if you are after good commedy which is very rare these days!The story is one of kind (a mafia boss going to a shrink), and Robert De Niro with Billy Crystal both did an amazing job... forget about the actres, she was not all that! But still it is good.If you want to enjoy this movie don't think of it as it can be real or not... instead swallow it as a light funny meal."
2,it has arrive & seen it . its nice clear & good happy with it,"thanks it was fast sshipping ,plus its original and perfact screen play .happy with the DVDEVERY ONE WHO LIKE AIR CRAFTS FIGHTERS , THIS MOVIE IS THE ONE FOR YOU !!!! :)I CANT STOP WATCHING IT . 6 times i seen it over and over :)"
2,Whyno Reader Version,"As I move around often, many Peachpit Press books I buy on the road usually, once throughly perused, end up in the hotel trashcan. Kloskowski's excellent PDF tutorial on Smart Object in PS, merely underscores my desire for publishers to make available PDF (or similar) versions of their texts so that we itinerants can view them and keep them while on-the-road. (I see that the NY Times has come out with a Reader version of its paper which is terrific). I'm a podcast convert; now make me a Peachpit Press Reader convert."
2,Compelling,"This series is wonderful. We must remember that Shiloh does not claim to be a Christian, therefore, while a good person, is not held to Godly standards in making his personal decisions. Once again, this series is wonderful! END"
2,Calm & Peace,I bought this for my new I-Pod. I love the calming effect it has and its a natural to go with me on those long walks I take.
2,Worth the price to keep the kids interested..,Sometime you just have tog et the kdis out and this will give you a great list of things to do that don't include Mcdonald's. Recommended.
2,i can't complain it was good,i purchased this DVD and i was very impressed. it was worth the $ and i would definitely recommend to a friend.jim
2,I think I play this album every day....,"It's awesome. I'm kinda glad it was ""lost"" 34 yrs ago, because it's well worth the wait. The only misstep to me is ""I Loves You, Porgy"". I think Gil Askey took Miss Ross too far out on a limb and left mother hanging on that one...BUT she makes up for it on everything else. Ross is in top form and her usual self-confidence in her craft is clearly apparent (or else she wouldn't have LET Gil sell her on that ""Porgy"" arragement in the first place). 5 stars. ""Let's Do It,"" ""No More,"" ""Easy Living,"" and the swingin' ""Had You Been Around"" are personal faves. Thanks Motown....though 34 years late. Thanks, Diana."
2,Size may be an issue,"Cloth diapering a newborn can be a little difficult. These state you can use them at 5 lbs, but I didn't feel they fit well until my baby was at least 8 lbs. Even at 8 lbs I am doing some more folding. Anything smaller, the diaper was too bulky, and it was hard to make it tight enough around the legs. EVERYTHING leaked! Now, at 8 lbs, it's much better. So, watch the size!I do enjoy the countour aspect of the diaper, and the material seems to keep my lil one dry."
2,Hilarious Gameplay,"I am not going to claim to be a fan of turn-based strategy games, or for that matter, real-time strategy games either. They've never appealed to me. But one day I read a review of this game in Electronic Gaming Monthly, and I got curious. A good friend of mine had recently purchased it on PC, and after playing it at his house I quicklsy saw what the folks at EGM were so excited about.This game is just brilliant. It's a turn-based strategy game in which two, three or four teams of worms wage a war on eachother on an unlimited supply of randomly generated terrain, and annihilate eachother using a wide array of clever and unique weapons. The gameplay doesn't get much funnier than in this game.The only reason I took a star off is that I feel this game loses some of it's appeal if you don't play it with at least one friend."
2,Baby One More Time,"The 11X platinum album, ...Baby One More Time, is Britney's first album to date. Her first single, title track, was an instant #1 single. The second, Sometimes was a great summer song which showed that she was no one hit wonder. Her third single, You Drive Me Crazy raced up the charts, and is one of the best dance songs ever. The last single off the album, From The Bottom Of My Broken Heart is a perfect ballad, and will soon to be another #1 hit. Also, Born To Make You Happy, very catchy song and was huge in other countries. Overall, do buy the album! It's a wonderful collection of hits, hopefully her next album will show more maturity and vocal strength."
2,I would recommend it,"I would recommend this product to others. The product is well designed - compact, easy to use and all parts fit together well. The food cooked in this rotisserie tastes better than the same food cooked in the traditional oven - it cooks more evenly and all of the fat is collected in the bottom tray. Actual cooking times are shorter than the times listed in the cookbook - a 3 1/2 lb leg of lamb took only about 2 hours. The rotisserie is easy to clean - almost all of the parts are removable and can be washed in a diswasher. I've given this product 4 stars because the skewers are not very easy to use and also some rust developed on the removable parts after washing. Also, it would be nice to have a lock for the front cover to ensure that the rotisserie is securely locked during operation."
2,Magic is what you get when you read this series,I loved this series which begins with this title. Was disappointed though to find out they are not all available yet on Kindle as I do love to read a series from start to finish.
2,good deal,"After ripping out the water saver pieces This is a great product. good power, decent settings, Hose that I could live without. Why would you sell a product with such a crappy hose? I recommend replacing it with a good flex hose so it's not touching your back every time you take a shower. If it had a flex hose I would give it 10 out of 10."
2,wonderful Penny shoes,"It great! it's hardly can find in malaysia.however it a bit big for me( 8.5E),as i use to wear 8D."
2,Software Geek,"Just noticed this was on the NYT list for 2012 and am elated. I read this book first in 1979 as a high school student considering my options. This book shook me to the core as any book that details a war should. Strong well written account of a brutal time, by someone who was there. Vivid images of a place and time that everyone should read. A must read, not just for the historical account of a war but for the timeless story of a man coming to terms with himself and his choices."
2,Great socks,These socks were a present for my husband. He loves them. They feel great and have lots of padding. Our only complaint is that they are VERY expensive.
2,so cool!,"mood for love is one of the best songs i've ever heard, i'm so in love with it! i was so surprised when i realized that keith killgo (i know him personally) made an album. i'm glad i bought it, buy this cd!"
2,great album,"This is a great first album.R.Pinto, sorry you had a bad experience with it. I invite you to check out the drummer on either the new CD or on some of the more recent shows (which can be found on archive.org) -- Albro (drummer) has improved VERY dramatically in the past, oh about, year or so. The difference is like night and day.I love this album, and still listen to it a lot. I feel that it is, truly, a Sweet Oblivious Antidote (which is the actual name of it, don't know why Amazon has it spelled differently...)Do yourself a favor, and check out PGroove - you just may like it!"
2,World Party Rules,"What can I say. I love World Party. I didn't know this latest effort was out there. I was thrilled to discover it. And it's good stuff. Probably not Karl's best - but a very good, consistant World Party offering, certainly good enough to make me happy every time I stick it in the player - like a visit from an old friend"
2,Insider Travel Secrets,"This book is an amazing compilation of ways to save money by traveling. For example, if you go to Disney World and are ""sponsored"" by a legal resident of Florida you can get savings of up to $100/person on ticket packages. The resident must come with you to the ticket office to do this. There were all kinds of tips that could even be applied to business travel in some cases. This book is a must for anyone about to spend significant dollars on travel virtually anywhere."
2,Best princess movie yet!,"Going into this movie, I was not overly excited. I got the impression from the marketing that it was in the vein of ""Shrek,"" with adult-based humor. I am so glad I was mistaken. This is a GREAT movie! I think it is my favorite princess movie yet--right next to ""The Little Mermaid"" and ""Beauty and the Beast."" The horse and the chameleon characters are wonderful--their facial expressions are hilarious. And I love seeing a strong princess who is not dependent upon her savior prince. My 4 year old daughter and 6 year old son loved it. We may even go see it again in the theater! It really is a wonderful movie. I don't know what Disney did wrong in the marketing, but if you have hesitated about going--DON'T! You'll love it."
2,Better approach,Griffith takes a different approach to introducing QM by ignoring the historical development and stepping into the math right away. QM can be considered similar to taking a bunch of baby physicists and dumping them in the pool at the deep end.His text shares the same problems all QM textbooks have which is they expect only the smartest students to be able to come up with the math.Having taken nearly 2 years of QM I'd recommend helping students by thickening it up more along the lines of his E&M; text.What's really needed is a better version of Liboff who covers a lot of territory.
2,Body Lotion,"The spouse LOVES (""LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT"") this lotion. I got yelled at pretty seriously when I left the last bottle behind on vacation. Lightly fragrant and not overpowering. It's lotion, what else am I supposed to say?"
2,Not a sparrow falls,"This book was interesting from beginning to end. I liked the main characters and there was suspense, enough romance for me, and I didn't know who Hattie was until near the ending."
2,Great for younger kids,"This book is extremely good for parents with children between the ages of 10-14. The games are explained in detail. They can provide hours of fun and entertainment for the whole family! My little brother (10) could play most of the games. But beware, there aren't really 50 games. There are several variations of the same type of game throughout the book."
2,I just listened to 'lunations' by Michael Brecker.,If you don't like this you need your ears syringed.
2,it works,It works. It's fast. Able to take HD vids with my tiny point and shoot camera and they look pretty good.
2,Great Poetry for Kids and for Remembering What It Was Like to be a Kid!,"I ordered 3 copies of Squeeze to give as Christmas presents, and now I've ordered a 4th--for my New Year's present to a friend. This book is a delight for all ages with its spare, evocative images, piquing the memories of childhood for those of us over 12, and putting words to the singularity of each moment for those under 12."
2,Wider than it is tall,"I was expecting this stockpot to be wider than it was tall but I forgot how to read product dimensions so it's definitely my fault for returning the item. If anything, this has taught me that ""14.8 x 13.2 x 10.2 inches"" means width x depth x height so if anyone is looking for a stockpot that it tall as it is wide, then just look at the dimensions.I absolutely love the quality of this product and highly recommend it for everyone but of course, that's only if you need a stockpot that is a bit wider than it is tall.Didn't serve it's purpose for me but it might for you."
2,Dr. Goodpet Scratch Free Review,Dr. Goodpet's Scratch Free was a good product to relieve my cat's allergy symptoms. I used this product in conjunction to changing my cat's diet. He showed improvement within two to three days. This was a good alternative for my cat who is sensitive to medication.
2,Exactly as described,"Bought this for my mouse, who doesn't use it. Not the sellers fault. Just as described, good price. Might be better for rats!"
2,have you ever heard of jazz accordian music?,"Well, hereit is. Art Van Damme is the only guy I ever heard of who played jazz music on the accordian. If you like lounge music or exotica, thenyou will enjoy this CD. At times it sounds as if you're strolling down the aisles at Home Depot, but other times the music really swings. Interesting."
2,Do I Have To Read This Again?,"While I, as the mom, might find this book (and all Teletubbie products) excruciatingly boring and banal, my kids LOVE this book.Taking the Teletubbie creatures through their Happy Day provides (seemingly) endless amusement for both my 1 1/2-year-old daughter and 3 1/2-year-old son. The page with the slide is the most popular; I have to believe there is some hand/eye/spacial skill to be learned here. Putting the Teletubbies to bed is also a favorite activity and an opportunity to do some color matching.While I cringe every time (10 times a day) my kids bring me this book, and I often feel compelled to inflict pain on Tim Jacobus, we just ordered a replacement copy as our original is dilapidated and LaLa is missing (don't ask!)."
2,"Beautiful story, film, and even DVD cover","I took my daughter to see this for her birthday. What a great memory for the first time watching this lovely movie! I adore Merida and all that she stands for. The music and cinematography are gorgeous. Seeing a strong female character is quite important to me as a mother. Combining that with a good story, Brave is a must-see and must-own movie for the whole family!"
2,Fit my GE stove perfectly,"These set of 4 fit my GE stove perfectly. I used other peoples comments as an indicator for the product, and I am very happy. Would recommend these to other people who have a GE electric stove."
2,The Best!,This may be the greatest medical thriller ever written! Do not miss it! It's even better than Twinkletoe S.'s best.
2,My favorite of his works,"This is the first book I ever read by Gorey. After becoming a bit of a fan and exploring his writings further, I think this story holds up as having the best narrative and shock value. A great little yarn and a must for the collector."
2,Here's the Secret!,"The Secret Life of Bees is a compelling story of a young girl's quest to free herself from the abuse she suffers at the hands of her father and to keep safe the young black woman who is the closest she has to a mother. In the process, the two of them meet a trio of sisters who teach them more than they could ever have expected. A great read, and a must have on every book shelf."
2,Nutritious Reading,I recommend this for book for anyone interested in getting a good general feel for how food production currently works and exploring ideas of sustainable food production. The book is well written and provides enough startling facts and anecdotes to keep one reading.
2,Perfect timing,This item was ordered on line. The seller contacted me and we recieved the product the very next day! This is the BOMB!!! My daughter loves it!
2,SO great- one of two favorites,"This video is awesome. It has a great theme song that my son (almost 3) loves to sing- everywhere, and it is played periodically throughout the video. The video is great for toddlers to young child (full of interesting facts and trivia), and is full of live action clips of different trucks, including the largest dump trucks used at mines, and has short informative interviews (these are very short, and are while the person is doing something, like driving a truck. There is actually a nice little interview with a female driver who comments on people being surprised women can drive the trucks). I would definitely recommend this video for any little one who loves trucks."
2,Leslie in the 80s,"Wow, I left my original 1 and 2 mile DVD with the pink background at my Mom's house out of town. So, I purchased this one expecting the same thing. To my surprise, this is 1980 version. It's ok, but I am a bit taken back by the dated look. The workout is still pretty good though. It was quite funny to see all of the old looks...a bit distracting but funny. She talked a lit less back then which is a good thing."
2,Great View on The Street,"This is a rich book full of great, in-depth info on the live of one of the newer market pundits to step onto the scene in the past years. Cramer brings a fresh, full view of Wall Street and what goes on with it. This book should be recommended reading for any investor professional or not, and Cramer's unique views on the market add to this fun, interesting read. Definitely should be high on the Summer reading list, as Cramer delves into the rich history of Wall Street and what it means to be a hedge fund manager surviving in today's anything-but-easy marketplace."
2,Hot!!!,"I will admit that I was one of the biggest detractors of Camron on the planet before. I felt his style was completely weak and his album was really wack. This single hasnt changed my view of the past, but I am feeling it! The use of the Monday night football sample was really ill, and even though his style is still kinda annoying, he does spit some tight lyrics. The chorus is tight too. So, to all Camron haters give this song a chance!!"
2,Great Flipflops but don't hold up very well!,"I absolutely LOVE the comfort of these flip flops! I only wear really comfortable shoes and these are the best flip flops I have every owned. In fact, as I write this I am getting ready to order my third pair....which brings me to the reason I only rated them 4 stars. The strap in between the toes keeps breaking, which renders the flip flop non-usable. I've had the pair I am getting to replace for less than a year."
2,Best show ever,"That was your fault idiot!! You're an idiot, so freaking hilarious I've seen it so many times and it never gets old. What did I do to get stabbed? Lol Titus is the man"
2,A Cinematic Classic,"A classic movie with a classic cast. Victor Mature and Susan Hayward shine in this 1950s classic movie about faith, love, temptation, and undying truth. True, it is not an Oscar Best Picture like ""Casablanca"" or ""Gone with the Wind,"" but it does contain just as much action, memorable quotes and classic stars (Susan Hayward, Debra Paget, Anne Bancroft, and Ernest Borgnine) the real icons of Hollywood cinema."
2,Very good and interesting reading. Hepan Heyi !!,"This is the best book written on the matter of the goddess Oya. I am an Oya priestess and I have not only found this book to be very illustrative, it contains prayers, patakis, and a totally different version of the ""Oya"" then the one the western world has attempted to illustrate.The author is very well informed and the context is well written.However, I would have given it a higher rating should the author not have gone into the lengthy discussion of Oya's role in the winds and atmosphere. Although the author's information on the matter is quite good and informative, I would have liked to have seen more context on the works, principals and patakis of Oya than a lengthy discussion on her role in the winds and atmosphere.Nonetheless, I would recommend this book to any Oya priest/ess or follower , student, or practicioner of the Yoruba religion."
2,An important reference for any serious Occult library,"""The Goetia, the Lesser Key of Solomen the King"" is instrumental in the practice of High Magick. This book gives the demonic order of the other planes. Originally compiled with the help of Alisteir Crowley, the infamous Ritual Magician, and undoubtably used in his ceremonies. This is definitely one of the Occult references to have in your library. It is not a work of fiction but considered by Occultists as a serious magickal work. This book will only be of interest to serious students of Ritual Magick."
2,Hello Nasty is a dope CD.,"I am really pleased with the Beastie Boy's latest release, Hello Nasty. The have come out with another great Cd. Even though it is not quite as good as Liscence To Ill, it is still good."
2,High-energy disco funk,"Part of the August Darnell / Ze Records family. Very energetic, disco/funk that is not usually heard anymore. Well worth obtaining if you like dance music."
2,Good movie,This product is exactly as advertised. This product showed up on time and as advertised. I would recommend this product.
2,Great movie; great quality,It's obviously a filmed play. The plot is totally predictable but Robert Preston's iconic role is worth seeing again.
2,Johnny Paycheck,I have been wanting this cd for quite sometime and finally decided to look into it on the internet. I am really glad I looked. I really have enjoyed my purchase.
2,Havin' a laff?,"If you need pithy lines, humourous asides, or something light to say about a lot of things then this book is for you but if you want a meaningful image of say, ""Summer"" then you won't find it in this book. Someone who just wants one book of sayings but wishes to cover the whole nine yards requires a broader application of quotations.Amazon as Amazoning as ever!"
2,IT RULES MAN!!,"This is my all time favorite Mystery Science Theater 3000, It is so funny, plus it has my beloved Joel Robinson (Hodgson) in it. Who if your a fan of the show will be coming back with Frank for one epsiode in the new season, which starts some where from January - March 1999CAN'T WAIT!! It's called Soultaker"
2,Great Purchase,I purchased this knife set for a good friend this Christmas. She loved receiving this gift. The quality is great and the set is very useful.
2,Great product,"I love this product, it heats up quickly and does its job. I love the clips instead of the pins and am growing my hair out even longer so that I can get the full benefit of these rollers!"
2,"Slow start, but fascinating","This book works extremely well if you're a fan of both the original movie and the TV series, as it provides answers to the question of when, precisely, did Duncan and Connor meet and other details about their friendship. The evil Immortal plot is really secondary to that detail, and weak in comparison until the middle third of the book. The writer doesn't give enough detail to developing Khordas as a horrific character until then, and by then, you've decided whether or not to continue with the book. It's worth it, though."
2,Absolutely Stunning,"I really don't have too much to say other than this movie was fabulous. In a period where movies are becoming less and less original, this was one of the most refreshing spins on a love story. You have to watch it to see it's simply remarkable."
2,Great book,"This is a most revealing view at the world we live in, the reasons for world problems and and the need for transformation.A must read by anyone who has even a fraction of a social concience."
2,good strap o.k. price.,this is a good strap but over priced.the bullets are great!they fell great!you could get a strap just as strong for half the priceover all a good strap.
2,Fascinating book.,"Excellent source on the Russian media, development of the Russian television. Very well researched. Full of insights on the role of top Soviet and Russian government officials in the development of Russian television. Good combination of personal interviews with journalists, experts, government officials, and analysis of public opinion research data, focus group data as well as personal observations. A good source for both academic and interest reading. If you'd like to understand what is happening with the Russian television today, this is a must reading."
2,Book for Class,"It was in the same condition as listed, maybe a little more writing in it, but that helps for notes for class! It came quick and efficiently Thanks!"
2,"Underrated, understated, drama.","I thoroughly enjoyed this excellent film. I rented it on a whim, but it proved to be an enjoyable evening's viewing. Catherine McCormack is excellent as the witty heroine, Veronica Franco, and Rufus Sewell does justice to an underwritten part as her lover, Marco. The one downfall of the film, is the lack of insight we get into the Marco's character. Apart from that, it is well worth seeing. The scenery, music and dialogue are excellent. Veronica Franco was clearly a fascinating woman!"
2,word 2003 for Dummies,I have been looking for a book like this. The others I reviewed were just as complicated as the program
2,Excellent very inclusive text,This book brings the latest technical and practical information together. It is very readable. Anyone interested in salt water aquaria would find it a font of useful information and suggestions.
2,Still the best!!!,"Even after 5 albums, almost 10 years, and a lot of GOOD albums, Gordon still rules as the best BNL album! Here their message and their pure enjoyment of their music is captured at its best, along with a lot of fun. This album was recorded for a bunch of guys that like to have fun, not go for profit. And the product is the finest musical CD to date. Though their later music is more refined, it doesn't have the soul of the original--Gordon. This album is simply fantastic!!! Too good to top!"
2,GREAT PHONE!!,"I was in need of new cordless phone and since my past 2 cordless phones have been Panasonic, I decided to go for it again. I must say this new 6.0 DECT is wonderful. I can now talk in my kitchen with the microwave on and not hear a garbled voice. It was soooo easy to set up, I didn't even need to look at the instructions. It's pretty much self explanatory.....and I like the fact that I can always add on another line in the future if I decide my kids need on in their room......"
2,"I was skeptical, but..","I was skeptical about Icky-Poo; the name was enough to put me off. I had tried using Nature's Miracle with moderate success. My cat decided the new sofa was her litter box, and got to the cushions 3 or 4 times. After the sofa cushions dried, I was amazed to find that they do not smell of cat urine - even with a nose up close! I also used the cushion injector, which I was very pleased with. I should mention that this time with Icky-Poo (and not the Nature's Miracle) I rented an upholstery cleaner from Home Depot, and I think that also made a huge difference. It seems to keep the cats away as well - they don't like the smell. It is not medicinal or off-putting to ""humans"" and really smells pretty clean and fresh. Certainly worth a try if your feline is being uncooperative."
2,Great buy for anyone who uses words!,"I'm a writer and an English tutor, so I use this a lot! I'm trying to get my boss to buy a few for us tutors, since so many of our students are english second language. Great for people like me whose idea of specific is ""the thing that does the stuff on the doohicky."""
2,"Bruce is so Goooooooood!, Matthew not bad either",I absolutely loved this movie. Perry is at his funniest and Bruce is just too cool.
2,Wow! What a great resource for parents!,"What an excellent way to bridge music and soical skills with a fun and dynamic resource. Just pop it in and you have an hour of Music Therapy and Speech Therapy combined. What could be easier? I loan it to clients and all the kids are ""hooked"" within the first few viewings. It's great because it is something kids can watch on TV while you have to cook dinner, and you don't have to feel guilty about the kids watching a video, because they are learning.I see a little girl with ASD who is 6 years old, and she requests the CD that accompanies the DVD each Speech Therapy session as a reward! She sings the feelings song and acts out all the feelings, and has generalized that skill with lot's of people.A wonderful gift for all kids and families with Autsim.Thanks Kibbles!Breena Hayman, M.S. CCC-SLPSpeech -Language Pathologist"
2,Foxfire 7,"Received my book in a timely manner and this book is exactly as I expected. Would recommend any of the Foxfire books to anyone, they are well written and highly informative."
2,Sharp vls20u digital viewcam with 3' color lcd screen,"Excellent choice for a digital movie camera. Takes stills from 1 to 16 frames per snap. Hook up to a TV to view movies or review thru the lcd screen, Never had any problems."
2,Does the job!!,"Great kit, had evertyhing i needed for one amplifier and its speakers! not less not more! i recommend this product! maybe if u want to install a big audio u should order 2.."
2,What the Osprey book should have been,"The Osprey Men-at-Arms book on the Texas Army is a weak joke compared to Bruce Marshall's brilliant book. Rarely do you find a meticulous researcher, artist, and writer combined into the same man. The biological accuracy of his illustrations might not equal those of DaVinci, or match the standards of the Chicago Art Institute, but they are plenty good enough to accomplish his intended purpose.This is by far the premiere reference for learning details, in color, about the regulation Uniforms of the Republic of Texas Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guards. (Yes, Texas also had a regulated and uniformed Marine Corps and Coast Guards.) Illustrations of associated flags, jacks, guidons, and naval signals are icing on the cake.Details of regulation dress are sometimes obscure or conflicting, and more information may yet emerge, but until then, this is the book to get. A solid five stars."
2,Do You Like Prequels?,"If you're into the Alien series and you like prequels, this is your movie. Very well done and ties into the first movie very well. Special effects are awesome and the HD picture and sound are stunning. The really great things is that the special effects don't overshadow the story. Enjoy!!"
2,"Makeover or no, Courtney kicks ass","As good as Live Through This, albeit with a more polished sound. The first five songs are as good a block of music as I've heard in a long time, especially ""Awful."" Madonna-friend or not, Courtney Love still has her edge."
2,Exciting Real Life Adventures with Humor,"With Wings as Eagles is a well written, humorous accounting of war-time adventures and the daily life of young men in battle. With photographs taken during actual bombing runs, flown through shrapnel choked skies, the author makes these adventures during a tragic time come alive with the humor necessary to live these dangerous, exciting moments in time.Gray is obviously an intelligent writer, who served as both a pilot and navigator, recounting the more than 50 missions his crew flew and the outlandish circumstances that often colored their activities. The captions Gray has inserted with his photographs are hysterical. Enjoy this piece of history, which poignantly manages to capture the intense tensions of combat, while exposing the close relationships these men had with each other and the ridiculous humor needed to survive such extreme situations. An excellent read.RJ FlemingGeneva CH"
2,Red stormed,"Well . i don't own this anymore.A great game , but it and the rest of Clancey's game ware out after time, I play the R6 games and Splinter cell , but even they get a bit boring and well the graphics are a bit old, but not bad.I how ever haven't played Vages or the newer GR games yet , so I'll review them next.over all it's a descent play .Be sure to check out CTGossamers , coming in 2008 , were I'll review games for PC and PS2 and as soon as I get a Ps3 or 360 . I'll review games for those consoles as well."
2,great book,My son loves dinosaurs and when I saw this book I knew we had to have it. He is 3 and loves to look at this book. He's learning all the names really quickly. Great color and pictures.
2,Works good for replacement,My container for my food processor attachment was dropped and broken. This container fits well and works very good on my blender/proceesor base.
2,Extremely Useful Editing Job,"I was looking for a version of the Bible for a friend whom I realized was not aware of its uses in literature, and this book is it. Then I found it useful as a Bible review for myself."
2,City Grits - Simply the Best Granola On Earth,"Every City Grits Granola you try is sure to please. This stuff is simply amazing - I have tried all flavors and LOVE all of them. Somehow the freshness just knocks all other granolas out of the running - this is truly the best granola I've ever tasted.Top picks are the PB&J and Berry; other favorites are Peach Pecan and Cherry Cashew. The Pineapple Ginger is good and unique - especially if you dig ginger. If you live in Seattle, hit the Fremont Sunday Market for samples galore from the very kind local owners/couple - salt of the earth folks who really just want to make a great product for us all to enjoy!"
2,It doesn't get any better than this!,"""7 Grandmasters"" is a 70's-style kung-fu classic in every sense of the word. Now released in 1998 (what took so long!), this film is arguably one of if not the best kung fu movie ever made. It combines a solid and classic plot with classic plot twists, ""secret book of strikes,"" animal form vs. animal form galore, grandmaster vs. grandmaster galore, and some of the most intricate intense kung fu action I have ever seen. Jack Long is fantastic. I remember seeing this film in its theatrical release, in Times Square, NYC as part of a triple bill in the late 70's or early 80's. I sat through 2 other films to see the film TWICE, as did everyone else! Put this one in a special place in your collection."
2,No Escape Required,I think that this album and Frontiers are the two best works Journey ever produced with their most recognized members of the band. I would say original but then Steve Perry wasn't an original member. This album and Frontiers contain an amazing number of hits and to me the songs that were not hits just as easily deserve a listen. I believe that this album and Frontiers provide enough good music to both Journey and non-Journey fans as to be highly recommended.
2,Good,"I've used it for the past two months, works well so far. All my IDE hard disks work with it. Would be better if it has a power switch to turn on/off."
2,pretty good cover,"This is not a flimsy vinyl plastic cover nor is it leather-like coverage - its in-between and just right. It fits my classic road bike very well and provides coverage all the way down to the ground almost even though I have a tall 27 inch frame. I'm not too enamoured about leaving my bike outside, as I am concerned about accelerating its rusting. We'll see how this works out. Otherwise, this cover is a good value for the money, fits properly and will keep away the bad weather. Perhaps a fully zippered breathe-able fabric cover might be the best? I have not seen one. Lacking that, this one is a very good one and definitely worth the $20."
2,Good product,"What a product should be, not high performance but quality like oem works great and the product came on time and good packaging"
2,what more can be said,"Plenty of wonderful comments have been made, all of them well deserved for this amazing film. I'll only add that despite how wonderful the chemistry is between Bogart and Bacall for me the core of this film is Bogart's relationship with his drunken sidekick Eddie. His love for a man who is wholly unloveable and annoying speaks volumes about this character, and Bogart plays it perfectly."
2,"Light and Sturdy, a Good Recommend","This is a very light, very sturdy guitar you can take anywhere. I've heard its sound as described as somewhere between a guitar and a banjo, with more guitar sound. The bag it comes with is strong, and holds up to just about anything. I bought mine a couple of years ago and love it."
2,Under the Influence!,"Junior Jack's ""Trust it"" is among the greatest house albums out there right now with the smash hit ""Da Hype"" that is samples from Human League's ""Don't you want me"" the samba influented ""E Samba"" that was a big hit in the summer 2003 and now yet another wonderful club hit in ""Stupidisco"" with female voice samples. The album is filled with wonderful house music with influents from all over the world, there's simply a great variety of songs here. Junior Jack had a big club hit long time ago with ""My Feelings"" and the've been making load of remixes but this is actually their first album i think. The result is amazing, apart from the songs i mentioned, there's funk (Trust it), soul,(alone) jazz( the roots) and latin (hola) inspired songs, if you haven't discovered house yet, it's time! and don't foget to turn up the volume."
2,Dragon Tamer,"Dragon Tamer is a must-read !It is so exciting, you can't put it down.Not only do you get to travel to Hong Kong, Mexico, and the Pacific West Coast, but the author also takes you on a journey through the dark world of drugs and the CIA.The main character, Blake Morgan, fights corruption while struggling with his own personal demons borne out of his childhood in a Prisoner of War camp.The characters are so well-developed, I hope to meet them again in another book."
2,My daughter's new favorite book,"Emma's Eggs is the cutest story of a chicken doing her best to please her owners. When she sees one of her eggs get scrambled, she tries to scramble the next one herself. Problem is, the farmer and his family are not pleased with her efforts. So it goes with each of her eggs, until she finally decides to sit on her egg and refuse to give it up. You can guess what happens with that final egg. The best line in the book: ""Emma fitted on her nest like the lid on a cookie jar."" The illustrations are wonderful; the expressions on Emma's face are priceless. This was an instant hit with my daughter, and she giggles every time she reads it. I highly recommend this book!"
2,the food is good & not cooking every night is heaven,"I have looked at a lot of cook-ahead cookbooks and chose this one because the recipes looked like something my family would actually eat. I was right - they are ""normal"" enough for my taco and hamburger loving children and tasty enough for my braised lamb shanks and grilled duck breast loving husband. I would agree with other reviewers, that if you are looking for budget do-ahead cooking, this is probably not the book for you. However, if you want to save time and have a realaxed dinner hour then I think this is a good choice. I have always balked at the once-a-month cookbooks because I can't imagine spending the 12 to 14 hours in the kitchen that kind of cooking would take, not to mention the kind of freezer space it would require. This seems like a great compromise and I have been pleased with the outcome."
2,A tale of destructive invaders,"This is a hard-to-watch yet necessary depiction of the destruction caused by invaders in a South American jungle in the 18th century. The natives were doing just fine, and even the Jesuit priests were not disrupting things too much for them, but then others decided to take over the area and make it their own, forcing out everyone who was already there.There are some horrifying scenes of people, including children, being shot and killed. Also, I question the priest's decision to remain in the mission with the people facing certain doom by staying there.I also am not sure I liked the casting of DeNiro as a European mercenary turned priest.However, the locations and other performances, as well as the music, make this a compelling film."
2,Exciting,"Could have used less of the romantic, but the pure Trek content was excellent. The story flow from episode to episode kept me on the edge of my chair."
2,Excellent Introduction to Philosophy,"Helen Buss Mitchell does a great job at introducing the reader to philosophical topics and concepts through this book and its accompanying ""reader"" with excerpts from essays by astute philosophical authors. I am currently enrolled in a philosophy telecourse and these are the required books for the class along with two videotapes. IF you can get the videotapes, they help a great deal as well. Mitchell has poets and authors reading some of their work as she discusses how it relates to the topic at hand. Even if you are not enrolled in school but want a solid grounding in philosophy, I highly recommend these books."
2,Very good,Fast with password protection.just the kind i was looking for.plus it has got the 1 click feature - helps to backup my data on the various computers.
2,How did I live so long without Cast Iron??,"I received this Lodge Cast Iron pan for Christmas, and I couldn't be happier! As read in other reviews, it is required that you season your new pan with oil for the first 2-3 uses. It takes a healthy amount of oil those first few test runs, but it is well worth the wait! After my initial oiling, I have been using my pan for months now without having to use a single drop of added oil. My crispy tofu has never been better :). I absolutely recommend this product, and forsee many of their wares in my future kitchen."
2,Awesome Tribute Concert which I NEED to Have,"I remember watching the concert on VH-1 or MTV back in 1992. I taped parts of it, but have since lost the tape. I need to get the entire concert on video again. There's too much talent and stars in that concert to not have this on print all the time. Please please release this on video again."
2,nice good quality,"i bougth this speaker at amazon and hook it up even it was small it was so nice crisp sound comming out from the tweeter small powerfull infact after ordering 1 pair of this i order another pair i enjoy this two way boss speaker i could recomend this speaker cheap but its worth buying for and you will be surprise what this can do,i dont know why some people give bad review maybe they dont know how to use this or dont know how to install ..."
2,This product is worth the money...,"This is the second heater/fan we've bought from Reiker. They're beautiful as well as functional, and we've been very happy with both.Reiker is also a very satisfying to do business with...when our first heater/fan's remote control stopped working, months after the warranty was up, we called the company and were actually able to speak to a person. After they had walked us through some steps to determine what the problem was and were unable to resolve it, they sent us a new remote control at no charge.We would absolutely buy another one of their heater/fans."
2,Loved it!!,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. If you are looking for an entertaining, suspenseful, drama, this is a book for you. It was a page turner, sometimes hard to put down. Donna and Virginia, keep up the great work, and keep these type of novels coming."
2,"Wonderfully readable, tell all your friends","Martha Southgate is a novelist new to me but I will be reading more just as soon as I can. This afternoon I polished off her The Fall of Rome. It's brilliant and entirely engulfing, and provocative. It's going on this year's best list. Wonderfully readable!It's really 4.5 stars but one doesn't get that option here."
2,A fun heavy converstion based film,"Over all this will only be liked by poeple who whish theycould write movies. I thought the movie moved along a suprising quick pace. The code only comes up once if I remember it correcrtly, it brings up a intresting thought or two. Overall I think the movie was overlooked Tim was really good in it."
2,must have cleaner,I purchased this product to try and revitalize my Le Creuset cookware that has black spots on the outside bottom of the pan. On some pieces I was able to get the spots completely out with a combination of Bar Keepers friend and Bon Ami. Others it did not help. I recently purchased new dishes because mine had several grey scratches from silverware. Well I decided to give the Bar keepers friend and Bon Ami combo a try on my old dishes and was shocked to see the grey scratches that had been there for years completely disappear. I now use it right away if I get a scratch on my new dishes. I keep both products on hand as I find that one of them will always get the job done.
2,"complex, thought-provoking, funny","This perhaps one of the greatest books I have ever read. What I find so fascinating and compelling about Rusdhie's writing is his ability to address mutliple cultural, social and political themes within a single work. His witty and darkly satirical writing style also lend tremendous humour to this work. Mr. Rushdie explores everything from the legacy of colonialism and neo-colonialism, questions the basis of Western notions of good and evil, challenges religious extremism and ponders the complexity of human relationships. Certainly, this isn't an easy book. However, I feel that the issues that Mr. Rushdie seeks to address are not simple ones."
2,I'll Wrap my arms around her!,"Do you realise this woman's voice has probably appeared on more records sold than any other female EVER! Think about it, 360 million plus sales with ABBA and a few million more under her own name, no other female singer comes close. So being very familiar with Agnetha's voice I wasn't really sure what to expect from this solo album but I wasn't disappointed. Certaintly the material isn't as good as what she recorded with ABBA, but the voice and production is still there. Her soaring vocals and high range sound as superb as ever amongst a wide variety of styles. Stand out tracks include the title track, Stand By My Side, Can't Shake Loose. Definitely well worth it."
2,Back Street Video,The movie was a favorite of mine and It was good to see it again. I appreciate the low cost of the movie and the quick delivery.
2,(No title).,"Ronald Smith is the phenomenal pianist and scholar who risked Alkan from oblivion. This finger-blistering and breath-taking music, although not always given the most precise handeling by Smith, receives extremely poetic performances its supreme exponent. I am greatly indebted to APR for their superb transfering and annotation of these recordings which were previously inexplicably unavailable on disc in the United States. This is an essential purchase for both Alkan newcomers, and Alkan devotees (who should alreay have it). You'll never tire of these performances!"
2,This book is a must if you have children you love.,A marvelous book. It is full of insight that answered so many questions I have had in a situation that is now over 10 years old. The author definitely knows exactly what he is talking about. I recommend this book to everyone that is involved in a high-conflict divorce situation. The sooner you read it and compare the hallmarks of PAS to your own situation the better. It isn't normal for parents to behave in distructive and negative ways.
2,Good for test prep,"This book is very good for test prep for the in-training, or scored, ASA exam. Chapters are broken down in sections that are either by subspecialty or topic-genre. The end-chapter answer sections are a little less than complete for my taste but a good cross-reference text should fill in the gaps just fine."
2,beautifully done,"a great looking film about characters whose lives keep affecting eachother in ways that they themselves seem to be oblivious to. a film about twists of fate, winter sleepers is at parts slow and probably too clever at times for its own good, but none of this really matters. the film is hauntingly beautiful to look at, with amazing scenery, music , and atmosphere. great performances as well. just a well done, pretty film that deserves way more attention than it has received."
2,A great improvement for power washers,"I really do not like to use my power washer. Hurts my back and works on a tiny area at a time. But this gizmo has changed all that. The only difficulty I had was trying to figure out how to attach it - maybe reading the directions more carefully would have helped. But after I unscrewed the metal wand from the trigger assembly, this attachment screwed right it. The truth is that power washing our driveway is still work, but at least it goes more quickly because you can cover a bigger area at a time. Our driveway gets stained from the iron in our dirt and it turns kinda orange. Well, this attachment gets about 80-90% of it. Hope it lasts a longs time. If you only use your power washer reluctantly like me, I recommend this item highly."
2,Not Free SF Reader,"A book that is a literary puzzle, an adventure of sorts, and full of sneakiness and tongue-in-cheekness. I have read quite a lot, and when I read this, I had trouble trying to work out who was who in quite a lot of cases. I suppose this is a lot of the appeal, though, being like a really, really hard cryptic crossword, at times."
2,The Battle of Olympus,This game is really cool because you play as greek hero and destory mythic creatures to save olympus and the world.
2,"This is a hat for life, The best of the best.",This hat is excellent. It is good value. Very good service. It fits perfectly. There is also a lifetime warranty which is very good. This hat looks good and protects your face head and neck from the sun.
2,good headset,I like this headset much more than the cheap original x box one that broke if you looked at it wrong. I have had no probs with this one and it works great and is actually very comfortable to wear.
2,A great read,"This was a good and descriptive time in history. The book brought to light some important facts about the earth's early beginnings. Though long, it was a page turner all the way through."
2,Taz Mania 2,"This Game is a great game you should get yours right this second this is so good I could have this for my whole live I also reccommend speedy gonzales game boy and Taz Mania Gameboy TazMania"" Taz Mania 2 is my favorite game Tazmania 2 these non spacing words can help you find your item. I am A 100% seller on Ebay all of my games work My seller name is Nintendad I sell my stuff on ebay Don't listen to the bad sellers like wom4bmmm they have a 50% positive ratings on amazon trust me I look At all sellers ratings."
2,Intelligent punk,"So much of the punk ideals that surged through the youth in the 70's has given way to the poppish punk of the 90's and plain idiocy. Penny Rimbaud and Crass represented the real anarchists of the day. This great book delves into Penny's life and the life of ""Wally Hope"". ""The Last of the Hippies"" (the last part of the book) scared me to death, because it reminded me just what the government can do to people. Rimbaud is an excellent writer whose brilliant style will take on a journey through his revolting life. A must read for anyone who considers themselves an anarchist."
2,Not related to The Arcade Fire,"If you're an Arcade Fire fan and are buying this book, keep in mind that the band itself has stated that this book has nothing to do with their album Neon Bible."
2,Walk Away the Pounds - High Calorie,"It's easy to follow along, no matter what your level of endurance is, plus it gives you a great workout."
2,Good coffee,"My Husband like this coffee. I just wish we could find other Turkish coffee brands or the Turkish coffee with Cardamom we used to get in Amman, Jordan. I would recommend this coffee to anyone"
2,Pilot G2 Retractable Gel Ink Roller Ball Pen,"When I learned that personal checks should be written ONLY with black gel ink to prevent forgers from bleaching out and rewriting those checks, that's when I became familiar with Pilot gel pens. Not only do I fancy them, I have to keep a close eye on these pens when friends ""borrow"" them. Yes, they are THAT good! I soon realized that I was depriving myself by not owning the red pens also. So far, the red pens are performing as well as the black ones do. There's a reason that Pilot G2 pens are very popular - they are comfortable and perform dependably."
2,Nice album,"Although this album was delayed for a while (losing some of the anticipation many had for it), ""Livin in the Scope"" turned out better than expected.The album is filled with hardcore tongue-twisting and solid production, even without The Legendary Traxster behind the boards for the majority of the album.The album's highlights are ""U Dont Wanna Blaze"" and ""Kill - Steal - Will,"" which feature nice production combined with wicked flows.Overall, ""Livin in the Scope"" is a much better effort than Do Or Die's ""Victory."" If you're a fan of midwest rap, you should own this album."
2,flexible flyer sled 48 inches,My grandson asjed for a sled for Cgristmas. I ordered it from Amazon. It was at my door exactly on time and in perfect condition and he loved it!!!!
2,Another great quilt book!,"I have actually used this book to make one of the frayed edge quilts. It was fun, and turned out great. I am planning on making most of the quilts in the book, they all look inviting."
2,"The best ""kids"" movie of the 80s (or ever?)","The Goonies is the adventure that all of us dreamed of having as kids. A rainy Friday afternoon transforms into an almost-believable underground romp with a group of kids that you could imagine yourself hanging out with back in middle school. Imagine that, a movie with an all-child cast that's actually likeable and who actually talk/behave like children! Screenwriters & directors today can learn a lot from Chris Columbus & Richard Donner.The great locations/sets and dialogue between the goonies never gets old and I make it a point to rewatch this at least once a year."
2,Sad this is not available,This is an excellent reading of the classic frog and toad stories. Unfortunately arnold lobel is less than inspiring in his rendition. Ed Asner rocks Frog and Toad.
2,"Excellent Cd,i like all but 3 songs,now that's good.",Here are my thoughts on this cd.24 songs i like out of 27.Al Martino sounds like Dean MartinThe Tassells lead singer sounds like Annette FunichelloRecommend These 2 Songs Especially:Big Bruce/Steve Greenburg-Funny!The Twelve Daze of Christmas/Steve Irvings-Voices!!I would highly recommend this cd!!
2,The best so far,"Out of all of the Karaoke games this one is far the best, more of a compitition. You can actually get kicked out. Just like the show. The songs are ok. I would like to see a larger selection but overall it is the best!"
2,A Must Buy!,"What can I say? Dada is by far the best band to ever exist. This CD is their best since their debut, Puzzle. Great music, catchy tunes, clever lyrics, awesome vocals. I don't understand why Dada doesn't get the airplay they deserve. Everyone should own this CD (and their other three as well). You don't know what you're missing."
2,It's Awesome!,I love this MP3 player! It holds tons of music and I put a bunch of Family Guy episodes on it and they sound great! It works even better then an iPod and the price is much lower for the amount of storage on it.
2,Phenomenal,"Loc-a-fella Reflection Sheen Spray is ""off the chain"". It gives me such a soft, velvet, natural feel and look on my locs. It also smell supermagnificant! I love to make statments of beauty and smell with my Reflection sheen spray!"
2,Beautiful Piece,Wonderful piece from McFarlane. Great for collectors. Will be a great value. Get this piece NOW!!!
2,They seem to like it,I haven't had much time to play it but the seem to enjoy it.. it's Spongebob after all (came with the Pixter)
2,"personal review about the novel ""Tom Ripley""","This book impressionates us because in the story of Tom Ripley you can feel the tension growing more and more.And suddenly you get aware of that the author must have thought a lot about that story and its development.Very interesting is, that the caracters are changing during the story and that the locations aren't always the same. So you often get new experiences and because of the very exactly descriptions of the different places and the caracters you can identify yourself with the whole story, you go with the persons very attentif and you are seizing until the last pages. But sometimes the many descriptions get you bored a bit..."
2,Power 90 In-Home Boot Camp Review,This product does work as I can finally see my abs and pecs are actually there!
2,An Aunt and a Cow-Creamer,"One of Wodehouse's most hilarious Bertie and Jeeves novels, _The Code of the Woosters_ will keep you in stitches. Wodehouse throws in all the vital ingredients including the star-crossed love of an old school chum, a mistaken engagement, a hideous piece of old silver and--of course--Jeeves. All other writers should take P.G. Wodehouse's correspondence course."
2,Love the music,"I have never seen the play (the only way I get to see any brodway play is if it goes to movie) and when I saw this at the movies at first I was put off by the theme of the lifestyle,etc. Not my cup of tea..a full movie about free sex (do not care if they are same sex or not tho) and drugs. BUT....what stuck with me was the friendship and how they connected to each other and the songs. So I bought the dvd, saw watched the movie again, and like it better the 2nd time around. This time knowing the story, I just did not 'see' the drugs and sex (well you never see the sex to that is not a problem) but got really into the friendships and how they all connected, stronger , this time. So it is now one of my fav dvd's."
2,We've lost a genuinely terrifying movie!,"Carpenter's ""The Fog"" seamlessly blends terror into a normal foggy night in New England. The secret is staggering, the stage is electrifying, the cast very believable. The movie made such an impact on me that I look over my shoulder every foggy night."
2,Great Entertaiment!,"You will totally love this movie, especially if you are an avid Kevin Tighe fan as am I. His supportive role gave great credibility to the movie. The suspense and the mood will keep you on the edge of your seat right up to the very end. There are moments that will make you jump out of your chair one minute and have you laughing the next...so get the popcorn ready, turn out the lights, call a friend to come over and watch The Sight and enjoy!"
2,Solid Entertainment,"NO SPOILERS HEREThe Sixth Sense is a solid entertaining film. It is a must for my DVD collection (and yours). We start with the casting. Bruce Willis has proven himself as a serious character actor (He's not all Diehard and Blind Date). Haley Joel Osmond proves that he is worthy of Adult-sized respect in Hollywood. (He alone made me see it a third time in theaters). Even the supporting cast, like the boy's mother and teacher have strong performances, although I can't remember their names. This film [without spoilers] has apparently set the Standard for which other thrillers are to be judged. Any movies that come out in 2000 will undoubtedly be compared to this gem. None will live up to its subtle way of grabbing you and then shocking you. The Ending alone was enough to make me see it a second time. Trust me. There are a lot of mediocre films with big hype. This film earned its hype through audience and critical response alone. This is the one to own."
2,Telling the Truth,"There are only two books that truly capture the reality, theinsanity, of making it on the fringes: Azzerad's Our Band Could beYour Life for music and Ray Carney's Cassavetes on Cassavetes forfilm. The punk scene, in film and music, is brilliantly, scarilydepicted in both--the fate of garage artists who too much of theworld takes for garbage artists. The doom and the horror. Theexcitement and the craziness. Long live indie art, one thing youcan't buy or sell, even in Amerika. Long live Harmony Korine and hisdad John Cassavetes. Long live Azerrad and Carney as chroniclers ofthe real, the beyond the hype, the stuff they wouldn't dare put on TV."
2,My 10 yr old neice is enjoying ths game.,This game was a gift for my neice who's 10. I had it sent to her home which is in another state. I have not been able to see it in person but neither she 0r her father have had anything negative to say about it. It arrived as expected. She is very happy with it. Her friend has already beat all the levels.
2,Great Movie,"I love this movie. Good clean humor that I enjoyed with my parents and siblings when I was younger, that I now enjoy with my wife, and I can't wait to enjoy someday with my kids."
2,"Angels, Professional Wrestlers, and Kung Fu","This is the funniest, most intelligent book I have read in ages. Thanks to C. Moore for a sentient, empathetic look at the craziness that is humankind and their story. Details of Christ's life from the point of view of his childhood buddy ""Biff"" (Levi) demonstrate simultaneously Moore's grasp of the Bible and of the absurd and human. Biff is a very believable guy, and though filled with some pretty raw stuff, this story has a ring of simple plausibility due to the great characterizations. It is worth reading for the adventures, or for the humor, or for the people who populate it... any of these could be enough. Bravo, Mr. Moore. You ARE nuts. (And we love it.)"
2,A reminder to use common sense,"The book was a required reading in business school for us. The central concept is that bottlenecks (and near bottlenecks) determine the throughput of the manufacturing process. It also shows how accounting can blur the picture of what is going on at a manufacturing plant. The book's story-telling style was a nice relief when other required readings are often dry and impersonal. Sometimes the story slows down and drags a bit too much for my taste, but overall, due to the importance of the message in it, I recommend the book."
2,good compass,"For the money it is good. But could not install behind the mirror nor on the dashboard because of some magnetic interference that won't let it turn. The only place it worked for me was up inside the windshield next to where they usually place the oil change sticker. However in dark you can not see what it shows. So if it only shows one direction no matter where you go, it is stuck in a magnetic field and need to move it away from it. The sticker is good so don't be afraid to try on several places until you get it right."
2,Retiring in another country,"Following in the footprints of other authors that have bought homes in other countries, the author, Barry Golson, shares his adventures in relocating to Mexico. Mr. Golson wrote an article for AARP Magazine about American retirees in Mexico. While there, he and his wife, Thia, were so taken with the Pacific Coast area that they bought a lot for building a future home.When he and his wife semi retired, they headed south to Mexico to build their dream home. This book is the story of their first year adjusting to their new life and neighbors while building their house. Even though I'm not a numbers person, I, too, would have liked to see more figures just to have a ballpark idea of the costs involved in making a similar move at this point in time.The book is great for anyone considering relocating to Mexico. We're not, but it is still an enjoyable read of the adventures and challenges of adjusting to a new home and culture."
2,A Children's book - but also an adult's book,"Everyone in my family - from my two year old brother to my mom - loves this book. A wonderful book, with charming illustrations. Great for the whole family."
2,2ond best Pleiadian Book Ever!,"Although not quite up to the standards of the awe inspiring Tahchee Chronicles, Marciniak spins a convincing yarn that does much to answer some rather provocative questions. Read Tahchee first then read this one."
2,pulls,"Looks great, ordered first from Acehardware outlet, then from Gradys. Gradys were out of stock and never notified me twice. The final two handles came after about 2-1/2 wks. Wont order from Grady's again."
2,I wish I could afford more,I would like a higher daily dose. It made me feel more alive and pure. I don't mean to wax phylosophical; the effect is hard to explain.
2,Rooted in the forest-abridged version,"This book is the perfect introduction for those fellow Drew-ids who would like to know more about the history of our Alma Mater. The authors take the reader back to the 1770's, to the plot of land known as the ""Forest"" by local inhabitants of the town that would become Madison, NJ. Tracing the history of the area and the university through many photographs. Cunnigham andDiverio, provide information in concise, easy to read prose. For those alums who would like more in-depth background, you should go to Cunningham's recently revised version of Rooted in the Forest. With either tome, you will gain an appreciate for the wonderful educational institution we attended."
2,Great pants.,I These pants are exactly what I wanted. they are the correct color and size. they showed up early ..better than on time. the price was fair. I will not hesitate buy these again from amazon.
2,Kneipp Herbal Bath - Spruce,"Another lovely Kneipp bath product! This reminds me of the German pine bath oils from Bavaria that I used when I was little. The smell is truly invigorating, and like the other products in the line, you don't need too much to have a great bath. Kneipp has been around for almost 100 years, and they still have a great natural product."
2,The best non-fiction book in years,"After so many stories of CIA screw-ups and stupidity coming from Washington, it's refreshing to read a book about a successful war, well-planned and executed. In less than two months a handful of CIA officers and Special Forces on the ground in Afghanistan defeated the Taliban and killed hundreds of Bin Laden's fighters with the help of U.S. airpower. This is a book that will be read for decades by people interested in the CIA, military history, Afghanistan and U.S. foreign policy."
2,Intrigue at the political level,This author takes this housewife to exciting places and into lives far from her own experience. It is full of romance .
2,good read for the seriously interested,this book is informative and written well enough as not to be a laborious read. recommended for those that are seriously interested in little known musicians of some importance. if you spend a lot of time listening to the top 40 or scanning the charts to see what's hot this is probably not for you. make sure you get a copy with the cd included.
2,I Like The Series,This was a good purchase. All disk worked fine and I enjoy the series. I plan to purchase more series in the future.
2,The Best Film Production Book I ever read,"And I have read a quite a few. I love this book. Dov's no-nonsense approach to Film production is amazing. His teachings on Writing the script of finding the perfect script are amazing pearls of wisdom that are working for me. No one can teach to write/come up with a budget like Dov.It made me not be afraid of the film industry and real independent still exists. This book made me take his 2_day Film School, and that wat the best 2 days of film education i have receive. Now i have a project in production and I'm following all of Dov's steps. Thank you Dov"
2,Does all I want,"I purchased this Ipod shuffle to replace one that was damaged in an accident. The unit does everything that I want, holds hundreds of tunes and the battery seems to last for ever. I travel nationwide by plane and with the cut backs on entertainment etc. I have a pocket size music machine to keep me happy. I only load the songs that I like because you do not have the option to select specific tracks from a menu.Would I buy another? I did, this is my second and love it."
2,My favorite series,"Though Blood of the Fold isn't my favorite of the entire series, I've read it many times and enjoy it."
2,"Like the thermos a lot, but don't drop it","I love this thermos. It keeps my coffee hot from early morning until mid-afternoon. I take it to work with me during the day. My husband works at night, so he decided to use it also. He dropped it on the way to the car on the garage floor. He didn't have the cup attached to it, just the thermos and the cap. The cap rim chipped off quite a bit, but it did not affect the use of the thermos. Now I find that he dropped it again, and more of the cap rim chipped off and the metal on the bottom is dented, and the whole thing wobbles now. Surprisingly, the thermos still works fine. It just wobbles wherever you sit it down. I am going to order another one for my own use only. He can keep the wobbly one. Moral of the story--don't let your klutzy husband borrow your thermos!"
2,I'm mobile!,"I am suffering from arthritis in my knees and cannot walk very well. This bike has given me back a lot of mobility. I am all over the place with it. With the large basket, I can take my clothes to the laundry and even take my garbage and recyclables to the depot in the park. It has made me more independent and I love it. Thank you."
2,Good,"Nice book, the book is based in questions and answers that really help you to take the physic exam (ardms)"
2,Catering to Nobody,"Good, easy reading with a plot. It's a book that can be read in an evening or two and holds your interest. A fun, easy read."
2,A must,Any fan of Alien should have this dvd it even has parts that were not seen on the The big screen.
2,Adobe Photoshop Elements 5.0 Window,"Bought this to put on my Vista laptop. Have been using 2.0 which like most programs is not ""Vista compatible"". I have enjoyed using the 5.0.It loaded without any snags or delays on my Vista - for which I am eternally grateful. It's close enough to the 2.0 to feel comfortable, but of course many more options."
2,Inspiring Swan Lake,The Philadelphia Orchestra did such a splendid job with this Tchaikovsky classic. There are very few COMPLETE ballets around here and I am glad I purchased this.
2,A really big platter,"This is a lovely piece by Fiesta--a rich warm color and the satisfying heft that you get with all Fiesta ware. Its a really big platter--make sure that you actually want one this big. I don't think its size comes across in the pictures (nothing for scale). Get out that tape measure and hold up 15 inches: is that really how big a platter you want? If so, order away! This will easily hold most large restaurant pizzas and is more than ample for serving a frozen pizza. Of course its also a great serving platter for a veggie offering; just plop a bowl of dip in the center and you're good to go."
2,Makes a great product even more useful,"I've enjoyed my Nesco dehydrator for some time now, and decided to add these extra trays as our garden starts to produce. I bought a total of four trays. They've made my dehydrator even more efficient and useful, and because of their excellent design they haven't cut down on the airflow or increased drying time."
2,Emo Without the Emo,"The Starting Line's new CD is a wonderfully crafted acoustic album. On this record, Kenny Wasoli truly opens up and shows himself as a maturing artist, being backed by the awesome electric-less strumming of Matt Watts and Mike Golla. The album is packed full of catchy hooks, distinct chops, and even some digital percussion, adding to the creativity of TSL. I highly recommend this album for those of you out there who appreciate acoustic music without the whining, nasally wailing of a certain other musician...lets call him C. Carrabba...no that's too obvious, how about...Chris C. Anways, purchase this record and you will not be disappointed."
2,Not his best but better than other's best.,"I am currently finishing up Virtual Unrealities and this is the first time I've read Bester's work. I am astonished about his current readability, it's like it was written tomorrow. His preoccupation with nuclear holocaust aside, the works are fresh, not to politically correct so as to be consciously annoying. I love short fiction but sadly most of the new stuff out there leaves me bored, disappointed or I just don't finish it. Honestly NOT his best but still way ahead of a lot of other people out there. SF readers forget that there is a strong heritage for this genre.It's a shame it's goes to waste. Like an author? Find out who influenced them and you will be in for a treat. That's how I found out about Bester, through J Micahel Strazynski (sp?)honoring him on B5 with a character name. I'm eternally glad he did. Maybe in 30-50 years someone will refer to the current author your reading like that and they will be enlightened."
2,Better then Harry Potter,"This book is a great read. A story which makes you think something that is the opposite of the truth. This great book is about an orphan named Widge who is adopted {in the time of Shakespeare} by a cruel master. Widge is driven by his new master's harsh words to steal a Shakespeare play named Hamlet. Widge goes off to London with his master's assistant to steal the play. When Widge is about to escape with the play he is caught by an actor, but nobody knows what Widge is up to. As the book goes on Widge makes friends with the actors, experiencing one stunning surprise after another. Widge has to steal the play or his master will kill him, but how can he betray his friends. Widge now has to steal the play or face his fear, his master's assistant, a dark hooded figure with no hesitation to kill: FALCONER."
2,Great Projects,I have bought this book many years back. and bought it again for my friend for the sake of the projects. the patterns are good. understandable.I strongly recommend it.
2,C-L-A-S-S-I-C,"Right after Let it Be, Tim is the Replacements'quintessential album and deserves its own spot among ""the best"". Can't recommend this album any higher."
2,Sea Change,Beck's music is ok and he is a different kind of artist and his music is a change from the usual music.
2,WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I just got this DVD on x-mas day and I was totally surprised!!!!!!!! I had to watch it right away that night because I recorded it on VH1 and the last 15-20 minutes was recorded over by another Fleetwood Mac thing. So I was SO happy when I got it!!! The DVD also has A LOT better picture than if you recorded it on a VHS and keep watching it over and over. If you have NEVER seen what it is like to be in a studio I think you should buy this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,Excellent stapler,"I just laid down a 1/4"" subfloor on top of old vinyl flooring in a kitchen and two baths. I shot about 3500 1.25"" staples and only had one situation with a double staple fire. (Probably my fault.) I was shooting in the sequential mode. Since this was my first time using it my accuracy of placement was a little off in the biging but improved as I learned hot to handle it. The stapler paid for itself on this one job as all the flooring contractors wanted about $320.00 to lay down 8 sheets of luan. My cost was about $72 for the luan and $99.00 for the stapler. I am sure I will find many other uses."
2,injector blades,pruduct does'nt seem to be on the market anymore. This is by far the best pruduct I've used for more than twenty yearsa it beats all the cheap ones that are on the market that they say are better.
2,my new puppy,"Length:: 2:33 Minshey, I've gotten a new puppy and I wanted to learn how to keep him and train him quickly. I want to share my experience with this book and show the value."
2,Irony for the playground set,"Very clever, funny, and ironic ""instruction manual"" for young children. My son and I both love this book. The outlandish instructions never cease to summon smiles, smirks, and giggles from both of us. Great illustrations!Witty, sarcastic, thought provoking, and unique. Qualities young and old will appreciate. Highly recommend!"
2,Good product for the money,"I bought this product for my daughter and have no real complaints. I know some others have said the strap is short, it is adjustable you do have to play around with it. The only thing that may be a little annoying is that it is a bit of a tight fit on larger carts ike the ones found at bj's costco etc. Also it would be nice if it came with a carry pouch or sack, but you can just fold it and put it in a small tote by your childs car seat so its always available. Good effective product."
2,THIS MOVIE IS THE ONE TO SEE,"It doesn't get any better then this. The Program is the best football movie i've seen. I have worn out my first copy and have bought a second one, i recomend this one to everyone. This movie needs more then the 5 star rating. Just get it!!!!!!!"
2,"Another take on ""A Reader's"" comments","I recently returned from a Photoshop seminar (run by digital photo professionals with no interest in sales of software). I am a home user and I use PSE to edit family pictures. The main reason that I am getting v3 is the 'Shadow and Highlight' tool. I learned in this seminar, and had this confirmed elsewhere, that this is the best way to edit skin color and brightness. Far better than other tools such as levels adjustment and especially Brightness or Contrast adjustments which give unnatural results."
2,Dracula - par excellence,"There have been so many productions of Dracula over the years it's difficult to find any that are even remotely in keeping with Bram Stoker's original.Nosferatu, in black and white was potentially close.This particular edition was for me perhaps the best, by far, of an often mediocre group.This movie rises from the crowd in so many areas, the young and rising stars, the storyboard that tracks reasonably well [with allowances for Hollywood] and sets that are far more accurate and believable than most.The effects, the musical score, the lighting and the projections of the actors are all presented as with a fine artists brush, well done, with many layers and multiple nuances.The extras are also worth watching, nicely packaged and enjoyable.A good addition to any coillection that was delivered quickly and in excellent condition."
2,Dollbaby a must read!,"Dollbaby is an excellent book that gives survivors of childhood sexual abuse or the loved ones of a survivor insight into past trauma in a way that also gives hope. I like that it is written in a more light hearted manner than many books of this genre, and I think this style of writing increases the feeling of hope for the reader or their loved one. Insightful and well written. A must read!"
2,Escaping from our own prisons,"This book was deeply moving on many levels, but I was especially struck by how Jarvis Masters was able to find freedom possibly the worst situation one could be in, while many of us, with relatively good lives, never question our own imprisionment. We're all in one sort of prison or another. Jarvis was shown a path to his own freedom, and in the true Boddhisatva tradition, he makes that path clear to the rest of us. Jarvis is an inspiration and one hopes that his message will be read by all."
2,Techno thriller with a message...,"Christianity and space come together, along with a twist of terrorism and politcal intrigue in this Christian 'science fiction' thriller. The technical aspects are well researched by this former astronaut candidate and space engineer. Not just for the guys either -- my wife has not yet put it down!"
2,Up-to-date database technology,"This book not only teaches Database Theories, it also keeps up with the lastest IT happenings that involves databases.The DataWarehouse chapter is one article that i've not seen in other database textbooks"
2,An excellent twist on a Classic,"The Emerald Burrito of Oz tells the story of Gene from Los Angelos taking a trip to the land of Oz to visit his friend Aurora. You get the impression right away that Gene knows as much about as Oz as most of us probably do, and that would be the 1939 musical starring Judy Garland. This book is about as far away from that movie as you could get. And its absolutely brilliant. Once Gene crosses the gate into the strange world of Oz he is thrust into a situation that may very well spell the end of this happy go lucky world of weirdness. The story itself is told through journal entries between Gene, trying to survive while well over his head, and his friend Aurora who firmly plants herself into the forefront of the action. All the classic characters from the film are present, but you may have to look twice at a couple because you probably wont recognize them. Over all it has a uniqueness to it that will probably appeal to most fans of the bizarro genre."
2,Everquest addiction,"After looking into this game that I have played since Nov of 1999. I would recommend it if you like to game and have the time to play. I have spent many hrs and days playing it. It is based off of D&D however, on the other hand it is nothing like it. It has the different races ranged from Halflings, Gnomes, Woodelfs, Darkelfs, Highelfs, Trolls, Ogres, Humans, Barbarians, Erudites.Classes range from Cleric, Druid, Rangers, Rogues, Shamans, Warriors, Enchanters, Magicians, Bards, Wizards, and now with the new expansion it has the Beastlord.It is very addicting, however if you have the time and patience I would recommend this game to you. If you are interested in the gaming process."
2,The Name Pretty Much Says It All,"..I mean, who couldn't use a ""third arm"" when trying to dry a dog ?This product is perfect for freeing up your hands, and yourconcentration, when drying your pet.It's well-made, with heavy bolts and clamps. It's flexible, yetit stays in the position you set it, to get your work done.Each grip comes with holes on both sides, which allow you to boltthis product to your grooming table. You'll want to do that, otherwise youwon't enjoy its full benefit... meaning you'll have to use two hands toreset the grip, if you need to adjust it during a drying session.Nuts, screws and washers for securing it to your work station, are not included in the packaging.It would be nice though, if they were."
2,Master Mind of Suspense,"Mary Higgins Clark has truely out done herself in this new book ""Daddy's Little Girl"". From the moment I picked up this book I could not turn the pages fast enough to find out what was going to happen next. As always she has you changing your mind on who dunn it until the very end. The people who come to her (Ellie's) rescue will surprise you also.I'm sure that there are many people out there that can relate to the title ""Daddy's Little Girl"" and how the youngest daughter (Ellie) feels. It may make you think differently about things in your own life.Have fun reading and I can not wait for her next novel to come out."
2,Hulk claws work great,I thought these things wer silly looking but I thought I'd give it a try and to my surpise they work outstanding. If you need to load up a garbage can or get leaves from under tight spots these claws can speed up the process. They also have adjustable velcro that make them fit snug on your hands.
2,Fantastic,"Hardball is a refreshing, unapologetic return to what drives success - strategy. The authors do a great job laying out the precepts and the supporting case histories are clear and compelling. It is a driving read and it rewards rereading."
2,"14 Qualities of Successful Musicians & How I Make $100,000","14 Qualities of Successful Musicians...., is an excellent, straight forward, no nonsense CD that will be very helpful to those who are serious about the music business. Many times musicians believe their talent will make them a star, and forget that this is a business where there are thousands of musicians who are equally talented, and it is those who do the business, who move to the top. This CD, though not rocket science, is a very valuable tool to help those who are interested in moving forward, to do so.How I Make $100,000 a Year in the Music Business, is an easy to read, well organized, common sense primer for the Music Business. It will not guarantee anyone $100,000 a year, but it certainly lays out the tools to show that you can make a very good living if you work at the business. I recommend this book.Carole Spiller"
2,"Letters, we've got letters","As the editor of TWO GARDENERS/KATHARINE S. WHITE AND ELIZABETH LAWRENCE, I welcome hearing from readers. I am now writing the biography of Elizabeth Lawrence and would benefit from hearing others' understanding of her, both in these letters and in her books. Emily Herring Wilson"
2,Compact storage for a large amount of CDs,Case is somewhat flimsy as is but a few drops of white glue fixes that in a hurry. Excellent storage system for large amounts of CDs.
2,Like It.,"Although this isn't the best quilt I have ever seen, I think it is great for the price. It is better in person than in the picture. I am thinking of getting another one because the price is so right. It is not too thick, you will need a blanket also if you live in a cold region like I do."
2,The symbiotic relationship between photography and society.,"It is rare to find a book on photography that is neither basic pedantry, nor a picture book. This book is for those who wish to take a wild ride upon a bucking whirlwind of a mind as it rides across the landscape of photography."
2,Will Purchase more books in the Probable Future by Hoffman!,"This book is filled with great character studies, with the sense of the time period, and has curves and spins that were not expected by this reader. An excellent read, and I was recommended to this author by another author I love who says that Hoffman is her favorite author. I understand why. Five stars!"
2,Good Deal,"The local retail shops had it for $69.99. So I saved $10 and shipping. Includes a battery, leather case (which can be strapped to your belt), and a carrying case for all the accessories.Only gripe was with US Postal Service. They're just inept. They attempted to deliver to a business on a Saturday (when they weren't open) and couldn't redeliver till the following Friday. Next time I'll pay a few bucks extra to get the professionals (UPS, FedEx, etc.) to deliver."
2,The Federal Reserve is a SCAM!!!,"Many people think the Fedeal Reserve is part of the Government when in fact it is run by private banks and not part of the government at all. The money we are holding only has value because we are forced by the government to think it has value when in fact, it is no longer backed up by gold or silver. The dollar is worth 4 cents what it was worth in 1913. How do you like getting a pay cut without changing the amount of money being paid? Your dollar can buy less that what it use to.Only coins like the ones above will save our economy and get the USA back on track...End the Federal Reserve and IRS, vote Ron Paul!!!"
2,"Good, not great","This seat was bought for my husband who was ready to undergo back surgery. We thought it would make it easier to get in and out of the car. Unfortunately we didn't think it thorough --the swivel can't swivel in a bucket seat. (We have a Subaru Forester.)However, I use it in the driver's seat to raise it up , so it isn't going to waste. I could have used a plain old cheaper pillow for that, but this is OK. I also am thinking of using it on a plain kitchen chair . It should come in handy after that surgery. It won't work easily in a recliner or other deep cushion such as a sofa."
2,My Huskies love the 8'' TEASER BALL.,My 3 Siberian Huskies love this ball! I purchased the 8'' size. My smallest Husky weighs 45 lbs & my largest Husky weighs 68 lbs. It is the perfect size for ALL 3 of them. Out of all their many toys along with several other balls... this one is their favorite! I am coming back to purchase another one. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS ONE.
2,A follow up book to The Miracle Man (1995).,"This is a really good book. It is a follow up to The Miracel Man (1995) also written by Sharon Sala. You don't need to read that book first, and i didn't click that it was a follow up untill about half way through, but once i did i understood the story line more.A good book, but buy it with The Miracel Man if i was you."
2,Another great track,"The one and only big hit by The Goodmen. Actually they did more tracks but I haven't found them yet and they weren't hits at all. This track reminds me a lot of ""Batucada"" by DJ Dero since it seems to start the same way, then the beat comes, then you can hear someone saying ""Give It Up!"" over and over again, and then you have the main ""melody"" coming. This is more of a house track actually, so if you like this music style you should check it out. This track was released in the end of 1992. That's it, I don't have anything more to say :-)"
2,Very Nice Quality,I bought this bed set off of a different site but for way cheaper. Other then that this set is amazing. Its so soft and so beautiful to look at. I loved it so much I bought the matching twin bed sets for our older daughters in the same color. The soft lining on the bumper and comforter are easy on the babies skin. It washes well too! Great Quality and I recommend these sets to all my friends.
2,This is just what it looks like,This is a very nice stainless steel canning rack. No more black fingers and no more scrubbing on that old one. Yea!
2,"I Know, it's soooo low-brow but yet SOOOO freakin hilarious","Yes, I would consider myself a ""serious"" movie lover, I enjoy art films, foreign films and the like... but for some reason, the immature behavior, the impossible actions and situations, and unrealistic plot add up to a total comedic romp into side-splitting lunacy. Great writing, great wit, and totally perfect when you need to step off of the reality bus to Hades. Great DVD too, since you can watch your favorite parts over and over again-like the whole shampoo/conditioner/stop looking at me swan!! scene..This is my favorite Adam Sandler movie in this vein of stupidity. OF course wedding singer is a darling film.....:)"
2,Poems to savor,"Anyone who has raised a difficult teenage daughter will relate to Sue Ellen Thompson's third collection of poetry, The Leaving. Most of the poems are dedicated to that subject. From packing a suitcase to visiting a college to decorating a Christmas tree Ms. Thompson allows us to eavesdrop on these personal and painful encounters. She does it beautifully. Her images are vivid, leaving no doubt as to what she wants us to understand. The book also includes selected poems from her two previous books, This Body of Silk and The Wedding Boat. ""The Compliment"" and ""Remembering My Parents' Sex Life"" are a couple of favorites. Even if you're not ""into"" poetry it's easy to appreciate the beauty of Ms. Thompson's words."
2,Battery Switch,"It is actually a Christmas present for my son, so I really don't know yet. I hope it is what he wanted"
2,It's not just about losing weight,"My weight loss journey is not just about losing weight. It's more about making right choices, starting each day fresh, and depending entirely on God. This book reenforces all of the above and helped to emphasize not just eating right but living right and making Godly choices."
2,Great waffle maker!,"We bought the Cuisinart WAF-4B Belgian waffle maker after reading all the reviews. Although some people were not too happy with their purchase, we decided to give it a try. It is great! Follow the directions and there are no spills. We set it at 3-1/2 and waffles come out perfect every time.Just make sure you spread out the batter to cover all four waffle slots."
2,I Lived with the Pilot,The pilot was a rude but polite man. He gave me shelter w/pay. They finally put him to rest 8 yrs ago. I need a copy of the book. @ 25 S lazona #18 Mesa AZ 85204
2,Also read I. IndieCD's review,"I agree with IndieCD's review. This book is a good place to start, but it's always a good idea to keep doing research! My husband also start with the lemon juice. I'm thankful for his info!"
2,This single ROCKS just like KACI !!!!!!!!,"You don't have the idea how this single is awesome. I Think I Love You is a very nice song, that is going to get stuck on your head in the first time you listen to it. I Think I Love You Almighty remix rocks too, and you won't stop dancing to it. Tu Amor has a dance beat and fantastic lyrics and to finish it has the incredible video version from I Think I Love You that Kaci looks amazing on it ! Buy this single now and have a lot of fun. I hope to see Kaci releasing another single, this girl is the BEST !!!!!!"
2,Great ideas!,"I've had this book for a year now, just about every recipe I've tried I would make again. I've moved away from cooking with a lot of processed food products, so I enjoy that these recipes avoid high sodium ingredients like condensed soup and onion soup packets. Those recipes have their place, but I'm not interested in eating heavy, fatty casseroles on a regular basis. Each recipe has an explanation with tips and ideas to modify the recipes with other options. I would have never thought of making steel cut oatmeal in a slow cooker, but it works great. Steel cut oats aren't something you can whip up in the microwave, so I fix it the night before I go to bed, and in the morning I have a wonderful oatmeal breakfast, enough for a few days and it stores well. I've been cooking long enough that I am comfortable modifying recipes as I go, this book is a good guide to expand what you think you can do with your slow cooker."
2,Care Bears Hearts at Sea,Care Bears Hearts at Seais very entertaining for my grandchildren they the the Care Bears and this Book Care Bears Hearts at Sea is one they haven't seen yet so even betterThank you
2,4-year-old loves this,"By popular author Marcus Pfister (Rainbow Fish fame). My daughter loves this story and asks to hear it every day. Liked the ""scary parts"" about a pair of young dinosaurs overcoming threats and finding their way back home. Charming illustrations. Great gift for kindergarten or preschool classroom."
2,Best of all X-Men Essentials,"I bought all 3 X-Men Essentials from amazon.com. IMO, the second book is the best of them all. It has gorgeous art, superb plot and it centered around one of the team's most important event. Not to be missed by X-Men fans."
2,Powerful but a little bit loud,"Power beyond believe but a little bit loud, it would be great if they can silence it a bit.You can actually hear how powerful the suction is."
2,Excellent TV,"Just so you know this is a brilliant show. It was written by Aaron Sorkin who created and writes ""The West Wing."" It's faster and more romantically driven than the West Wing, with tight writing and excellent acting. Well worth checking out."
2,Very nice,"Nice hoops for the price, and you really can't tell they are not Gold, all the way... but only coated.So far so good, there's something I personally don't like. is the weight. I think, they are a bit heavy, pulling on the earlobes.But, I will keep them and wear them."
2,old spice original,"Been using old spice original after shave lotion 50 plus years, for some strange reason I cannot find it in stores, only the classic which I don't like."
2,The best cordless batteries on the market,"I have used a lot of different tools/batteries. These outlast all the guys at work who are using dewalt. The batteries actually make a cordless sawszaw a useful tool. Even my boss was impressed. The only draw back is they are not cheap, but you get what you pay for."
2,Cute Toy,We gave the Rescue Pets Sheep Dog and theRescue Pets Border Collieto our then 2 and 5 year old kids last year for Christmas. They both still pull the dogs out to play with them. My now 3 year old daughter still loves this dog. She has taken it on car trips and to church with her. The toy will either whimper and cry or bark happily while wagging it's tail and moving it's head. The good thing for the parents is that you can also turn it off. So bringing it to church was ok. My daughter now wants the one with the alarm clock on the collar.
2,good stuff,"useful everyday china that is colorful and at a reasonable price, also apparently contains no lead"
2,"Awesome, but not for Powerblocks","These hooks are great and allow me to get a great dumbbell workout without risk of injury trying to swing the weights in to place. The only thing I'd like to warn people on is the major inconvenience of using them with powerblocks. It's a major pain. You you have to strip down to the handle, slide it in sideways (barely fits), then you have to place the weight back in sideways (by hand). I had to pull my old olympic dumbbells out of storage for DB presses because I disliked they way the worked together so much. Totally killed the efficiency of the powerblocks."
2,Web/Skype Cam,"This Skype camera is great. We started using it to stay in contact with our elderly parents and our grandkids. (Being able to see them is priceless!) Then I was offered a job that I could work from home, but needed to have Skype. It has been great! And you can't beat the price!"
2,Huh?,"I'd like to point out that this is NOT a TREASURY, but a SCRAPBOOK!!Scrapbooks consist of the strips, and treasuries consist of the scrapbooks. This contains no color, and a minimal amount of srips! I was highly dissapointed and mislead by the title of this item."
2,Purchased as a gift,I bought as a gift for my daughter. She likes the book. We have a Senegal which is a terrific bird! She was asking for a breed specific book and so far has found it to be a great reference.
2,OLDSCHOOL HARDCORE,One of the best oldschool bands ever. This mis where it all started. Songs about sticking together and fighting. A classic and a must have.
2,great for the bike!,great product.. I have a few of them... put them in the bike basket on a beach cruise and rock out to tunes on the ipod... great sound! batteries last forever in this.
2,First Mushroom Book,I bought this book for my boyfriend but ended up wrestling it away from him during our first mushroom outing. I took him to Mt. Pisgah in Eugene where they hold an annual mushroom festival. We had a lot of fun identifying the more obvious ones but had a difficult time finding several mushrooms in the book. The problem could've stemmed from us being in such a diverse area for the first trip. All in all I love the book. The stories and pictures add a nice touch. It was an informative and fun book.
2,Let your mind go and enjoy this movie,"Although similar to the original, this The Parent Trap still sells the story. Updated for the 90's, The Parent Trap still plays on the familiar warm fuzzyness that the original used so well. Quaid and Richardson give compelling performances but the real treat in this movie is Lindsay Lohan, who does a great job acting two seperate characters, and even nails the British accent. A great movie to watch on a dreary/rainy day."
2,Fifteen really fun games bound together in one book!,"This collection contains Go, Checkers, 3-D Tic-Tac-Toe, more. Each two page spread consists of a game board on one side and instructions facing the game. Covers are made of heavy board stock. Bound into the front of the book is a clear pocket filled with glass counters to use with the games."
2,"Banagh's Henry V: ""Once more unto the breach""","Excellent adaptation of Shakespeare's play, with greater emphasis on cinematic effects than on poetry. The script is not a literal translation to the screen; anything that would take away from what the audience could experience visually - long speeches and monologues, for example - have been reduced drastically or expunged altogether. The movie concentrates on the Agincourt campaign and subsequent battle; the battle itself is lavishly rendered while there is little on Henry as the developing conqueror or boy-king. This is what makes it different from Olivier's HENRY V, which was more about the man than the events. Banagh's version is more an epic than an inciteful character study. Banagh, who also directed, is excellent, however, as Henry. An excellent movie in its own way; well worth a watch."
2,Makes You Want To Turn Gangster,"Monster was so full of detail that it felt like I was on the streets of Cali when it was happening. What you get with this book is not just an understanding of gang life but you can feel what the victims are feeling and what the offenders go through. You are in his shoes now, and he is blasting slugs at enemy gangsters from 5 feet away with a sawed off shotgun. It's so realistic it's almost as if you can feel the kickback of the shotgun. Those feelings will stay with you throughout the entire book. Monster is definitely for anyone who has never been around gang violence or wants to understand gang life without really experiencing it. This book did a tremendous job showing gang life and their battles. It will make you want to turn into a gangster."
2,"Subtle, well written, first class SF","Like several other reviewers I reread this recently after a gap of many years. My first reading was when I was too young to appreciate its deeper themes properly, but it nevertheless made enough of an impression that I've never forgotten it, I think just because it's very well written. Revisiting it I'm very impressed. I suppose it is ""charming"" as one reviewer has it, in a sense; but there's a dark undercurrent to the charm - good and admirable people do terrible things. For that matter, the ""Rite of Passage"" itself is frequently fatal...This probably deserves a place as one of the top dozen or so SF novels. It is in no sense a ""children's novel"" if that means ""unsuitable for adults"", but the ideal reader would probably be a thoughtful adolescent (like the heroine)"
2,Decent value in a puppy pad,"I have two pad trained Maltese. They use these, as well as a 'grassy' indoor potty. The male prefers pads.The nice thing about these is they are easy to shake open. Most users of pads know what I mean, as doing the quick one-handed shake to open a fresh pad is something most of us have done. No shifting of the insides when shaking to unfold.On the other hand, a came across a few that had some sort of adhesive on them, rendering a couple of them useless.So, my take is that they are decent pads, but the company has a slight quality control issue."
2,nice,mostly used it for divs movies and works with me super fine after i upgraded it with the latest firmware.all .avi files are working fine as well as AC3 codecsand very easy to use
2,Bridging Gap with Questioning Catholics,"Excellent easy to read book, with short chapters (responses to most commonly asked questions). Not all will apply to 'thinking' Catholics, but includes wide range of topics from Papal Infallibility, recent scandals, and cafeteria Roman Catholics, limited roles for women in organized church, etc.Is written by a Jesuit priest, scholar, but from an Irish perspective, which is obvious, but understood in that context, is an excellent easy read, and helpful to those of us still faithful but 'struggling' with the official church."
2,Clipse: Not Too Short,"I'm writing this not as a review but in response to some of the Amazon reviewers who wrote that Clipse's Hell Hath No Fury is too short an album. Listen rap fans: the problem with many full-length hip-hop albums is the obligatory 49 tracks per CD (not to mention the 12 interludes and 18 hidden bonus tracks) where you're sure to find loads of filler and -- as a result -- be turned off by what could have been a masterpiece had it been whittled down to a select few songs. The average pop CD contains a total of 12 tunes, so it's refreshing that Clipse didn't conform to the usual hip-hop excess (and created something of a classic in the process)."
2,Great wedding present,"My husband and I registered for this very same item at Target and are so glad that we got it. Now that my sister-in-law and her husband have bought their first house, we thought this would be a great gift for them to have."
2,Solid Feeling Strap,"This hand strap only works if you have purchased and use the extended battery pack. There is no place to attach the strap at the bottom of the camera but there is a place to attach the strap if you use the extended, vertical battery pack."
2,Good stuff,"This is a good collection of World of Darkness stories. ""Wolf Trap"" and ""Glimpses of Before"" were really good, probably the best ones in there. I was very disappointed, though, that it states on the cover that it includes stories about mages and changelings, and not a one even mentioned either. Still, these are top-notch tales."
2,Lodge Dutch Oven,"exellent pot, use it for all kinds of cooking applications. I have a ""Big Green Egg"" for barbequing and place the Lodge Dutch Oven inside to concentrate the heat: it works great in this application as well.Qick service from Amazon as always.............good price as well"
2,Works great and great price,"This beauty easily holds my wife's collection of songs within the 2GB, nearly 1,000. The FM reception is great too, beats out those older Sony Walkman's. Great for use at the gym."
2,One of the best and most underrated bands keeps evolving,"A pleasant departure from their older style. Most similar to APSoG, but often more up-tempo and harder edged.Underrated by 'traditional' FW fans wishing for repeats of No Exit, Perfect Symmetry or Parallels, but Disconnected is undoubtedly among FW's best work, to which only APSoG can arguably be said to be superrior. Definitely one of the best prog-metal CDs around.Takes quite a few listens to start appreciating its greatness, but it is well worth it. You discover something new about it every time.A must-have."
2,Vanity Fair classic pajamas,"I've been wearing this style for many years. The only problem is that if I get medium the top fits but the bottom is too small at the waist and the legs are too short. So I get large, but then the top almost falls off. They also seem to be making the top part longer and longer. Another thing - every now and then you get a pair where the hem wasn't sewn properly and one loose thread causes the whole thing to unravel."
2,Great book,"I loved this story and will read it again...and share it with friends.The book made me laugh, cry and learn. What more can you ask from a book?"
2,awesome music,"I really enjoy lifehouse. I saw them in concert, great live show! I did't have the stanley climbfall cd, so I am glad I got it. It sounds good."
2,"a good begining to an excellent carrer, a must for stygians",The album has the begining touches of tallent seeping from every song. The group's first recording attempt that lead to great hits later in their carrer.
2,A Prime Example of the Little Grey Cells,"The second Hercule Poirot mystery, The Murder on the Links, by Agatha Christie is a good example of the method of its detective and his little grey cells. The cast of charaters is small and there are some wonderfully complex twists but the main pleasure to be derived from this book is setting up Poirot in counterpoint to a more ""modern"" detective who uses less of a psychological approach and more of the blood-hound method examing the minutiae of the scene and following the scent. Hercule Poirot would definately not be a avid ""CSI"" watcher. The story also contains many romantic elements, another popular genre used by the author, that generally work better here than in other of her books. A good mystery, if not a Christie classic."
2,Excellent book,The book is excellent. The author describes the different kinds of personality disorders related to lying. He also writes about the importance of lying in childhood and adolescence as part of the normal emotional development.
2,A beautiful workout,"I have a fair number of Ana and Ravi's DVDs (as do most reviewers, I noticed) and this one (along with Solar Power) became an instant favorite!This workout has a lot of variety in the poses and also because it works on your energy on multiple levels, not just the physical. It's a good one to choose when you're feeling frustrated or stuck in some area of your life. It's peaceful and powerful at the same time!I always feel a great release in my upper back and shoulders after this one! Give it a try and lighten your load!"
2,One of their best,"I have almost every CD by Tetes Raides and only recently acquired ""Le bout du toit."" Although this is one of their earlier recordings (1996) and perhaps more acoustic than some more recent recordings, it is nonetheless a terrific place to start listening to one of the most interesting bands from France. Over the years, they have had an influence on a number of great bands in the French alternative/traditional/punk scene, including the likes of Les Ogres de Barback, Les Hurlements de Leo, La Rue Ketanou, La Tordue, Polemil Bazar (from Quebec), and more recently Leoparleur. Tetes Raides' more recent CD ""Fragile"" is also an excellent CD, though it's difficult for me to pick a favorite from their discography. An understanding of French helps one get the band's sense of humor, but their music mostly speaks for itself. Don't let language get in the way of a new experience in music!"
2,An excellent collection,Langford has done an excellent job of pulling together some of the key works from the Wesleyan tradition and demonstrated their relationships with one another and their tradition. This is the only book of which I am aware that undertakes this task. It is highly recommended for any interested in learning about Wesleyan theology and the shape it has taken over the years.Also highly recommened is its companion Practical Divinity: Theology in the Wesleyan Tradition.
2,Loved it!!,"This is a great book. God really taught me a lot through reading it. You really get a good sense of how the order in which the names of God were revealed is so important, as well as the historic events that acompanied each revelation. This book gave me a much better education in the names of God than I have ever recieved in a sermon or anything else. I hope you enjoy it too!"
2,"If you liked the show, get the book!","I saw the show and had numerous questions and a desire tofind out more about the families and the details of theproject. This book answers nearly all of the questionsand gives considerably more detail. It also portraysthe families and individuals in a more sympathetic andrealistic light. The photos and layout of the book area pleasure, it is worth the price!"
2,I raised sweat over this one!,"I loved this one so much (and after reading her other novel first, Big Trouble, which is also a Must Buy!) that I actually spent 15 more minutes on the treadmill so I could finish it! Jameson is a great author, with wonderful characterizations and great feeling between the characters. They seem human and caring and sexy and I just plain didn't want it to end! I am awaiting the next one with baited breath."
2,First time user,"First some background. It is my first time using an electric shaver, all my life I have been a blade guy, so I have not point of reference respect others electric shavers. I arrive to the 8140XL trough a friend recommendation for Norelco shavers and after researching a lot. For the price it looked as the better value for money I could get.Let's go with the review. The 8140 is well designed, easy to handle, easy to move over your face, not heavy, and very quiet. The heads feels very soft and they do not get hot, I was afraid of burns, but after two months of using it that has not happens. The shave is very close, not as close as a blade, but not bad. I do recommend this product."
2,Superb,Superb. My wish is that this talented writer will oneday tackle the dawn of Abstract Expressionism as well.
2,Interesting Story,I enjoyed reading the book very much. It is a story of the author's journey to shamanic healing. She has a candid honest approach. I found it an interesting story and insightful. I looked forward each night to reading the book until I finished.
2,LET'S JOURNAL!,"This journal gives you room to keep track of your garden for next five years! Very simple, beautiful pictures, very inexpensive."
2,A heart warming celebration of life in the face of adversity,"On the surface 'The Lost Salt Gift of Blood' appears preoccupied with tragedy and death. However, read a little deeper and one finds it to be very life affirming. The themes of family, traditions, relationships, death, isolation and endurance echo throughout the short stories. The thematic parallels are skillfully woven into the fabric of the novel, highlighting that indeed, no one story can stand alone. It is worth reading!"
2,GREAT 2nd album-finally on c.d.!!,"If you love their song ""eye of the tiger"" and never invested in any of their albums-then you've missed out on a LOT of great music-including this,their second release!AS a matter of fact,ALL their albums (except for maybe 'caught in the game')are very strong,including the first one,also now available on c.d. They also deserve credit for replacing their excellent lead vocalist(Dave Bickler) with the awesome Jimi Jameson(Dave sang on the first four albums)Do yourself a favor and check out this band that easily could have been a HUGE sucsess with a little more support from the music industry."
2,Not bad at all,"I think this movie could have been MUCH better. I really think it was a great concept and Rain did a fantastic job, but it never got above being a guilty pleasure for me. Having said that, I love being entertained and this movie entertains me with the action scenes. It just isn't a great MOVIE."
2,soylent green,"This movie rocks, a verry interesting look a near future with poluted air and water and worst of all short food supplies. A murder mystery and the investigation by the corrupt central police, with a backdrop of poloution unfathomable over population and food riots. The most original opening credits of any movie,that brings you up to the start of the film.In the end with mystery solved and the heros dead or about to die we learn the only truth that maters WE ARE ALL SOYLENT GREEN!!"
2,Wonderfully weird!,"I have been using Rowenta irons for 15+ years and when I needed a new one that was the brand I intended to purchase. However, when I saw this Oliso iron, and the incredible price, I decided to give it a try. This is a high-quality, yet weird, iron. It does an excellent job ironing. It takes a little while to get used to the legs that come out of the bottom of the iron whenever you take your hand off of the handle, but it kind of makes ironing fun (well as fun as ironing can be!). I do worry about some of the other reviews that state the iron does not last long, but for the price I think it's worth the gamble."
2,A whole new level.,"Once again, this show is taken to a whole new level with Season Four. The mythology is expanded and goes deeper than the other seasons.We get the exciting conclusion to the last season's cliffhanger.We get the most controversial episode of the entire series: ""Home""(stand-alone episode).We dive deeper into the plot of Mulder's sister. We also find out more about the black oil.We find out that Scully has cancer in this season. It's only hinted at in the third season, but the truth comes full circle in this season.Lastly, we end with a cliffhanger that, if you haven't seen the next season, will surprise and shock you.Great season, great DVD."
2,williesmom,I bought this for my son for his 4th birthday. He uses it every free moment he has and the batteries have held up really well for so much use. He learned very quickly how to use the internal games and loves to draw and color. A great gift for any child.
2,Great Album! Like all of them...,"Tool Absolutely rocks and everyone who is a fan knows that this album, like all of their albums, is awesome! If you don't have this one yet, I would highly recommend getting it!!"
2,Hands down the best chai tea,"Just the right balance of spices and tea, and the longer you brew it, the pepperier it gets. If you leave the bag in too long, like all teas it will get bitter, but the spices get bitter and the heat from the pepper can be a bit much. Anything less than 10 minutes makes the perfect cup. Yum yum yum.Other chais I have tried are Yogi (too weak) Celestial Seasonings (strong vanilla, no spice flavor) and Stash (heavy heavy on the cloves). I'm not inclined to try the others since this is perfect."
2,a little expensive,"but worth your money for die hard fans, the booklet is very elegant and the bonus tracks are awesome."
2,Incredible!,"This is an anime series worth wathching at least once. Oh, by the end there is going to be a character that you will hate with so much passion that it's amazing. It's worth watching just to have your emotions so hightened."
2,Good,It's a fine CD and has some good songs especially God Bless The USA but I wonder why they put Oh Holy Night which is a Christmas song on a CD where the rest of the songs are non-seasonal. I love Christmas songs and I listen them throughout the whole month of December and when I played this CD for the first time the other day and Oh Holy Night came up my family was like why are you listening to Christmas music in April?
2,Diana (A Tribute To A Princess),"This movie was more enjoyable than I thought it would be. Amy Seccombe does a reasonable job as Princess Diana, as does the man who played Dodi. This movie takes us through Diana's last days - at times you can feel her pain and during the landmine scenes you can see her determination to do something about this dreadful problem - Diana cared, that came across. You find yourself wishing you could change the ending - if you cared about Princess Diana I recomend you purchase this video. I got my copy from Amazon, it arrived quickly and in excellent condition - the picture and sound are of good quality."
2,Read THIS Instruction Manual Before Trying,"I read the guy's website because I can't afford $299 for a book and trust me, it's a helpful thing to read if you're feeling down and thinking about doing yourself in. After too many sites and books that tell you to trust God and everything will be fine, I'm grateful to have found someone who basically says ""Okay, here's what will happen if you don't get it right"". Makes a bad divorce look like a walk in the park. ;-)I'm too vain to blow my head off and too scared to risk doing it wrong, so might as well stick around. It was better than therapy and much faster."
2,Imperfect but enjoyable comedy,"3.8 starsYou know if DeNiro, Levinson and Linson are all involved on a film, the odds are it'll be at least decent. Add Penn and Willis playing themselves to great satiric effect and a great turn from Michael Wincott and you've got a film, that despite its various failings, is still a solid test screening.It's hard to not think of The Player while watching WJH, though this never gets to those heights (and depths...it's a much subtler skewering of Hollywood). Both films love to hate the film biz and its attendant phoniness, and DeNiro delivers a fine performance. Though it's almost too low-key at times, and I did get rather bored a few times in the middle when I'd think, ""Why do I care about this guy again?"" But his deadpan reactions bring some great comedy at times, so it's worth the occasional slog.If you like movies about movies, and some intelligently bitter humor, this is a good bet."
2,You'll like it its fun.,"I like this game, but... After a while it gets frustrating. It is fun seeing characters from the cartoon, but when you get to the 1930's world, and the Martians world, you get fists of fury. I recommend renting the game before buying it. But don't think of it as the worst game on the planet either. Hey, I liked it! Don't give it to 5-year-old gamers that are way too used to stuff like Spyro and Crash, because it gets frustratingly hard in some places. Happy game playing!"
2,Every woman should read this book!,"This book has been such an inspiration for me to follow, it's the ideal gift for every woman. Society in general would benefit greatly by the changes women can reflect after applying what we've learned in this book, I can't say enough on how much I enjoyed reading it- it is an absolute keeper, one I will sure pass on to my daughter for her family's benefit and all cherished girlfriends."
2,I cookferalivin',I have this honing steel and I love the oval shape because it works an edge on all sizes and shapes of blades regardless of their quality.5 mojo*z for this workhorse
2,Keep Working at all Costs!,"My review is simply this, in all true knowledge something can be gained from it, if one views it in a positive manner. This book has knowledge in it and is the reflection of a devoted Artist. Negative opinions are a waste of time and energy. No single source of knowledge of music or any other subject is all one will ever need, so.... in light of this truth one must seek out knowledge and learn continuously if mastery is to be attained."
2,Delightful read,I read this story to my 6 and 4 year old and they really enjoyed it. They learned a few facts about Thanksgiving sprinkled in and learned empathy as well. I then loaned the book along with a jar of candy corn to my son's Kindergarten class. Cute story!
2,Smaller privacy filter,"This was great due to the smaller laptop used for traveling. The privacy screen fit perfect and such a great price, comparing to the other brands. 3M came through again!"
2,wonderful,"one of the best probiotics I have ever tried. I have been taking these pills for about a week now, and it really seems to be working wonders on my overall health.I would recommended this product to any one who is diagnosed with IBS, and or suffering from chronic diarrhea or irregular bowel movements."
2,An Instant Hit with the Mrs.!,"My wife loves to bake for the holidays. She's really good, but she was getting a bit disgusted with her old-fashioned hand-held mixer the past few Christmas seasons. So, I bought her this mixer as an early Christmas gift last year. My wife was so thrilled, she baked Christmas cookies all day that Saturday. I could have won ""husband of the year"". Guys...if your wife likes to bake, and you don't have one of these...get one for her! It will take you out of the dog house to the penthouse instantly! ...a personal testiment!"
2,Still Waiting,"I bought this solely for the DVD. I enjoyed it a lot, really. It made me wish they'd release ""Eat to the Beat"" as a DVD (that way we'd get the rest of it.) So, I'm 'still waiting'."
2,Bird Calls is a great way to teach young children about birds!,"I ordered this book for my two year old grandson and he loves it! It's been so popular with other kids that I've ordered three more as presents. The ability to ""find"" the bird in the leaf cover and then to play the bird calls is what makes the book so attractive. We don't read all the information about each bird because it's too much for little kids; besides, we're too busy playing the calls. A fun and unintended way to use the book is to open it to a particular bird and then play the wrong call; my grandson, who is learning about jokes, loves to do this and then look at me and say ""That's not a chickadee"" as he plays the barred owl call.If you have young children who are interested in birds (or you want them to be interested in birds) this is the best book I've found for little ones."
2,Overall good,"I buy this product for keeping documents at home. I'm not taking it to anywhere. So it is a nice, solid one. I don't need to worry about broken."
2,Story and illustrations wonderfully entertaining,"This book, like all the the Church Mice series, is not to be missed. Rarely do my children and I become SO excited about a book as we did with this series and this book in particular. Oakley's illustrations are endlessly entertaining and we see something new each time we read this book. The picture wherein Sampson, the church cat, pretends to get rid of the mice is too funny for words. We stay up too late at night after reading this book at bedtime because we spend the next half hour talking about our favorite parts. Children and adults will enjoy this book."
2,scientific calculator,This is a good product. I would reccommend this product to other people. It is very reliable. The appearance is very good. The only problem I seen was that the icons for the operations were very small.
2,Superb,"Similar to the previous seasons, this one packs a great deal of amazing CGI beautiful images and interesting facts.the only downside is that it is too short i wish they make more episodes in a season."
2,Wow.,"As a broke college student, I started avoiding meat after reading books about food that revealed its actual composition and the horrific ethical problems with the factory farm industry. Reading The OD was an affirmation to invest in high quality meat that will nourish ourselves, the environment, the animals it comes from, and the farmers who care enough to do things the right way - not just the most inexpensive and convenient. It was a reminder that meat is a treat, something that should be eaten with gratitude for all that enables it, and that everything about eating at McDonald's is unnatural, unhealthy, and overall an utter lack of consciousness and knowledge. Pollan's writing is extremely smart, engaging, and funny, and the OD will likely affect your life."
2,Ordered as a gift for my Dad.,My dad had been using one of these for years and needed it replaced. I ordered and gave to him for Christmas gift. He has already used it & very happy to have his other one replaced. He basically wore it out.
2,A great album with amazing band music that you will enjoy!,The best songs in this CD are easily under-rated on the charts. The most elaborate songs that are very delicious to just sit back and eat up!
2,Great product,Solid well made razor. Gillette and comparable products are a total rip off. This will give you the same or better shave for a fraction of the cost.
2,It's one of the best books I've ever read.,"I'm in 6th grade and I read ""A Girl Named Disaster"" over my spring break. It was terrific!I absolutely LOVED it! It was like I was there with Nhamo. Her adventures are realistic and her spiritual encounters are truly magical!"
2,Essential Clapton,"This is an absolutely fantastic album. It is a bit different than the great albums came before (Blues Breakers, Layla, Slowhand) and after (Unplugged), in that it has a cleaner and more ""produced"" sound. However, one of the things that makes Clapton great is his ability to change styles, but still make the sounds his own. If you like Clapton, buy this album.BTW, if you own this album, check out August which I see as the precursor to the style which Clapton fully developed on this album."
2,I'm really looking forward to the next book(s)!,"I thoroughly enjoyed Touch of the Wolf. I like well-written paranormal fiction, and the characters in this book are appealing, three-dimensional, and very--well, they would be insulted if I called them ""human,"" but you get my drift.In the author's note at the end of the book, Ms. Krinard proposes not only two more novels in this particular series, but tying all of her werewolf novels together and spanning several generations--up to the present. To me, this is a marvelous idea.I've noticed below that some of the criticisms of this book center around the fact that there wasn't enough room to fit in the story, the romance, and all of the details on werewolf daily life that readers would like to know. If there were an entire multi-generational, multi-national saga, just think of all the interesting little tidbits Ms. Krinard would be able to include!Publisher, please take note!"
2,former parishioner,Brief but to the point. Daily life experiences that influence & guide.Will place my copy in our church library.
2,As colorful as the costumes,There are a lot of really beautiful scenes from the movie as well as behind the scenes photography. It's pack full of stunning movie stills as well as lots of behind the scenes information that might add to your appreciation for the hard work that everyone put into making this unique movie. It's a great coffee table book that you'll enjoy going through time & again.
2,Good quality cables,"Good quality cable, and a good deal for the price. The 1/4"" leads are labeled with ""ring"" and ""tip"" so you know for sure which is the left and right channel."
2,1960's radicalism account,"Written by a former radical, this criticism of 1960's radicalism describes what happens when radicals promote violent social change. The author, who converted from left wing radicalism to hard core conservatism, has his bias but the first-hand account is certainly worth reading."
2,rock legends,This is probably the 3rd time I've purchased this album for 1 reason or another. A must have for Dwarves fans. A perfect example of what this band is all about.
2,"Good premise, not sure about the delivery!","I was very happy to purchase this zinc cream for my occasional acne. I don't see it making a huge difference but it is tinted which I didn't know and anything that sort of works and doesn't dry my skin out is fine with me, then again, it doesn't cover that well either! It doesn't hurt my skin and who knows, maybe it will help down the line. It's a lot of product for the price, so I'll keep using this up."
2,What a great read!,"Kids will love this book. My son, Chase ~ 8 years, decided it was so good that he voted the author ""tied for first"" when determining his favorite. A must read for third through fifth graders!"
2,Travel back in time...,"I've had this book on my shelf for several years and decided to finally dive in. Although the writing helped to transport me back in time and I truly enjoyed the story, it was a little difficult to follow at times. I felt that he should have made chapter endings rather than jumping to another topic in the middle of the page. Otherwise, I truly enjoyed this book and highly recommend it."
2,Best CD I have bought this year,Love the cd. She has a soothing voice and I have been playing it on my work cd player for a week now and still haven't gotten sick of it. Bought it for song #1 however have enjoyed the entire cd.
2,Would you like clean underwear with that?,"Do NOT drink anything before you see this movie. One, you might-no, WILL-miss something funny if you go to the bathroom. Two, you will not want to get up anyway, and will laugh so hard that you wet your pants.I have not seen a film twice at the theatre since I was 12 (now 23). I don't care if this was nervous or sympathetic or obnoxious laughter, there was quite literally a steady stream of it. It felt damned good. It is the zenith of prank humor, chock full of yellow snow cones, bungee wedgies, and using display toilets in hardware stores. Just choose your date with caution."
2,Great game for competative family,"My daughter loves this game, although when we got it, she hardly got to play since her uncles and I couldn't leave it alone (and we are all over 30!!). I have since purchased three more of these, not for my nieces and nephews, but for my brothers!! Of course it didn't take long for my brother to learn you can stick your finger in the hole and trigger the score... but that is just part of the fun. The batteries are long lasting.The only downsides are the announcer guy is a little annoying, but it does mute and its annoying that once opened and constructed it does not fit back into the box. I found this uped the probability of those little balls going missing. We cram it back in the box. Foutunately it has a self shut off so even if the on button gets hit in the cramming, it still shuts off. We own just about every game there is, and this one is truely an ageless toy. I plan to bust it out this Christmas for another bulls eye show down with my brothers."
2,Great CD that speaks to your heart,Andrew Peterson is well on his way to being a beacon in Christian music. I bought this CD based on a couple of song samples and haven't regretted it yet. There are plently of songs with great hooks and thought provoking lyrics. There is a great deal of acoustic guitar work here but then we are treated to rich orchestrations to accompany it.
2,Bargain of a Book!,"Saving money every day--now THERE'S a concept that makes my husbands wallet glow with affection! Whether it's appliances or zinnias you need, Ellie Kay can save you cash. This book is a bargain hunter's dream. Kali Schnieders, Author ""Truffles From Heaven"""
2,Why shouldn't KF play around?,"One of the things I have always loved about Ken Follett's writings is that he experiments with subject, tone, and genre. And why the heck shouldn't he play around with a buzz issue like cloning? I thought The Third Twin was a lot of fun and enjoyed the characters and plot. Lighten up folks! The English language is so robust it challenges writers over a lifetime to come up with new and different ways of saying things."
2,A Good Resource for the Rehearsal of Shared Stories,"When a group of people shares a good story, there can be great pleasure in relating to one another on the basis of that shared experience. Books Every Child Should Know provides a forum for the rehearsal of shared stories. It contains a wide variety of knowledge-based games -- Q & A, fill-in-the-blank trivia, cryptograms, word searches, crossword puzzles, synonym/homonym substitution, and so on -- all drawn from different genres of children's literature, including Mother Goose, Aesop's Fables, cultural myths and folktales, classic literature, and Caldecott and Newbery winners. There are also several short book lists that touch on the high points of these genres.For families that read a great deal, this book can provide a good opportunity for entertainment based on shared stories, and for classrooms it provides the opportunity to rehearse (and perhaps assess) the knowledge that has been retained through reading them."
2,Funny!,"My husband and I cracked up laughing throughout the movie. This was surprisingly very hilarious, cute, and a little disturbing at the same time (weird seeing a teddy bear do sexual innuendos in a grocery store.)"
2,Kids love it,"The kids love this train, plus the Thomas train I got with it. They have little magnet bits on the ends so the trains can stick together. The trains themselves were a little smaller than I expected, but the kids don't seem to mind, although they keep getting lost because they are so small. The toy is colorful, well-built, and the kids love it."
2,Growing pains,"Why the fuss over X&Y;? Because A Rush of Blood to the Head was so good.Instead of wringing our hands over the fact that X&Y; may not surpass AROBTTH, let's just relax and enjoy the music."
2,blood sweat and tears greatest hits,This is my favorite CD of all time. If you like horns this is the CD for you. I can't say enough and I was not disappointed with anything on this CD. Pure classic genius!
2,A girl's adventures in the California gold rush.,"Twelve-year-old Anisett's father died on the long journey by wagon train west to California. Now her mother provides for Anisett and her little brother by selling food to the miners. When Anisett finds a chunk of gold in the stream behind their little cabin, she knows this discovery could end the hardship of her family's life. When a desperate, gold-hungry miner learns of Anisett's discovery, he takes Anisett and her family hostage and threatens to kill them if they don't reveal where they found the gold. Anisett put her family in danger - now she has to save them. This was an exciting historical novel that I highly reccomend."
2,Dream Theater does what they do best.,Dream Theater has done it again - an amazing album that showcases the immense technical abilities of the members as musicians without taking away from the poetry that is their music. The DVD is also very entertaining and goes into a lot of fun detail on how the album were recorded and what kind of stories are behind the songs.
2,Good value - I purchased to replace Howard Horns that cost 3x,"I purchased this horn to replace a set of Howard Horns. The Howard Horns cost at least 3x what I paid for this air horn yet the most important part, the compressor, appears to be the same. The install was easy and the sound is just as loud as the Howard Horns. I recommend this product - it is excellent value. The horn is clean; there are no hanging tubes or wires and it doesn't cover up much of the engine. I did this install on a 2008 Harley Davidson Ultra."
2,Tumbling Blocks,This captivating series is just so fun to read. I look forward to each book as they come out. I hope they never end.
2,A Guide to Live By,"In Ethics for the New Millennium, the Dalai Lama introduces a new way to consider ethics, very different from the views of Kant, Mill, and Socrates. It is a passionate explanation that says we do not need to consider a deity or religion to understand that it is compassion that should drive our ethical behavior. A compassion for other sentient beings who seek to maximize happiness and minimize suffering: a core Buddhist teaching. After setting this foundation, the Dalai Lama then expands upon the idea, giving us examples of how we can implement these strategies into our lives as individuals and then what changes would help ease this process in society. The overhaul will not be quick and easy, but when it is applied to your life, it has the potential - he guarantees it will - to increase your happiness; not with material happiness that lasts only temporarily, but spiritual happiness that will last for the rest of your lifetime."
2,Surprisingly sustained anthology,"As with all anthologies, you have to take the good stories with the bad. But in this year's Best New American Voices, I was glad to see that--for the most part--these new writers were more than holding their own. Charles Baxter did a wonderful job of judging this volume--no surprise there. The two highlights for me were Christina Milletti's ""Villa of the Veiled Lady"" and Roopa Bhattacharyya's ""Loss."" These two writers have a sure sense of rhythm and an appreciation of long sentences. Other stories that caught my eye were Jeb Livingood's ""Oh, Albany, My Love,"" Kira Salak's ""Beheadings"" and Whitney Davis' ""The Sharp Light of Trespassers"" which opens boldly with a discourse on rivers. Hopefully, we'll soon see some of these writers with books of their own."
2,great product,I was pleasantly surprised with the Logitech speakers. The size and appearance are just what I needed. The sound is great and they take up very little desk space. I am very happy with this purchase.
2,Great for speech!,My two year old had double ear infections for the first year and a half of his life which made him delayed in speech by a few months. Our speech pathologist recommended the Baby Babble DVD's to me.WOW!!! My son automatically started repeating sounds and words from the movie.There is a lot of repitition and fun objects to get the kids talking. This is a great DVD and I would tell everyone (actually I have told everyone) to get for their babies and toddlers. I LOVE IT!!!!
2,Hours of fun,"We bought this set for our grandson and he loves it. It was a little tricky to put together, but once we had it together our grandson plays with it daily. We have attached it to a couple of his other sets as well. This toy gets played with."
2,I listened to it and IT was great!,"My name is Ameerah Washington and I'm looking for some muscial pieces that I have lost. Those pieces include La Feista Mexicana, Greensleves, Summerland(vartions from four season I think?) and a particular variation overutre. If anyone out there can help me to find these pieces or atleast put me on the right path to finding these pieces I would most appreciate it.Thank you. Ameerah Washington"
2,"Fun and enjoyable, what else is music supposed to be?","I've had this CD since 1998 when it came out. Great fun and it gets played every summer. I'd buy it again if I lost it. Crack open a beer, sit on your deck, hang with some friends, and enjoy. Sweet..."
2,Good game for young kids.,"I bought this game for my speech kids to play. It is simple, fun and doesn't take up much space."
2,A Fun Word Book,"My 3 year old daughter just received this book. She adores it. She especially loves the page about different professions (although I'm surprised to see the woman nurse!) She is so pleased that she can identify so many of the objects, and enjoys learning about new ones too."
2,The Awakening,"In this soul searching new release by Angie Stone can be found the essense of a woman. Never condescending, and always inspiring, Angie does it again. ""Easier Said Than Done"" reminds us that for every woman with that natural sparkle of wonder in her eye, is another that has lost it by dealing with the oh too common boy masquerading as a man. Life's lessons are so gracefully etched in wax, that the overall vibe of this album will make you say ""Remember When?"" Angie has displayed her unadulterated spiritual self for all who dare to listen. Please Believe. For the daring, check out track 2,4,7,9,14, and ooh my god 15. With a twist of love, passion, disappointment and defeat, Angie Stone rises as a shadow of what is yet to come in all of us! Peace"
2,A good resource on this fascinating people,"While written in a dry, academic style, Wysner's book is a valuable resource on these indomitable mountaineers of North Africa. Jam-packed with fascinating data, this book provides information hard to find in the English-speaking literature."
2,splatter,Excellent when cooking on the stove. Making bacon and hamburgers. This item protects you from the spattering and spitting that occurs when cooking.It keeps the grease from hitting you.
2,Fantastic Plastic,"Invaluble resource.Well laid out, beautiful book.Does not contain some of the more exotic plastics such as PEI (ultem) but most are covered."
2,still one of the best,"Gary Moore will always be on the list of my favorite guitar players. Like SRV and a few others, he wrenched every ounce of feeling, heart and soul that anyone could pull out of wood and metal with help from electricity. I got this CD for the cut There's A Hole, if nothing else. Besides his distinctive covers(with obvious influence and homage to hero Albert King), I like Gary's originals, too. This disc is over-the-top distorted blues rock by one of the masters. I miss the music we won't hear because he's gone."
2,Excellent Review for 1st time visitors!,I think this is an excellent DVD for a 1st time vistor to the Grand Canyon. The video gives one a great start for the geology of the canyon and breaks down the 3 major trails and their advantages and disadvantages. I can not wait to go visit!!1
2,Good Detangling spray!!!,"I purchased this from the drug store because my hair was dry and tangled and I didn't want to put anything in it to weigh it down. Well this product was the answer to my delimma. it's light, smells great, and left my hair really soft and manageable. I love it."
2,A Useful Worship Resource,"For those of us pastors who are faced with the prospect of trying to provide for meaningful worship Sunday after Sunday after Sunday, Bayler's book is a marvelous resource. His language is good, the readings and responses are appropriate and it is clear that Bayler has a gift for language. I've used his resources for the past several years, he has a book for each different year in the Revised Common Lectionary--and have never been disappointed with what he has presented as a guide. As far as I am concerned there is not a better resource for worship preparation."
2,Pretty good book,"This is a pretty good book about American Indians and their difficulties in going into an urban environment. This book can get tedious at times because all the problems the Indians face seem not to be their faults at all, which is hard to believe sometimes. Yes, white society made it difficult for them, as did the urban environment, but the author places most of the blame on these two entities and not even a little on the Indians themselves."
2,Great value,"Given the price of the table I didn't expect much. However, I was pleasantly surprised. The table is comparable to others that are two or three times more expensive. It is sturdy, attractive and easy to assemble."
2,A well written book about the Holocaust.,"I think this book gives a great explanation of the Holocaust through the eyes of someone my age.Some of the things that the Nazis did to the Jews were a nightmare. Shaving their heads and tattooing numbers on their arms was very brutal. I was really amazed at the bravery Chaya had when she took Rivka's place going through the gates to Lilith's Cave ( to the smokestacks). But one of the most important things I learned was what the Devil's Arithmetic really was 1+1+1 -- living minute by minute, day by day, week by week. At any time the SS could come to you and say you are one of the chosen ones. That's why you never wanted to do anything wrong because you could have died or been killed at any time. Something like this could always happen again unless we stop it from happening.By Darcy W"
2,Haunting,"I can't believe this album could actually be made. Something that makes you think as hard as this has got to be good. I don't know if you can really call it depressing, because the music has no hint of darkness or sadness to it. I guess it just really makes you sit there and examine your life in such a way that you do get depressed. And no, I'm not saying my life is pathetic... I'm actually quite happy. I discovered Failure after hearing their smash-bomb single ""Stuck on You"" on the radio. Afterwards, I quickly scooped up the CD and was actually dissappointed. This is an album that grows on you over time and soon attaches to you like a leech. You never forget, nor do you want to. Buy it now for an experience you'll never forget."
2,Supberb album,"It a classic Beatles album that sounds great, I am glad that the records are available again, kinda cool listening to vinyl records again, love it and recommend to all Beatle enthusiast,"
2,Fast and beautifully done.,"I loved this movie, from beginning to end.First there was Bruce Lee, now we have Ip Man or Donnie Yen. The action thriller not only tells the peril of the Japanese occupation in China but also the brutality of fighting and warring, which China has experienced for quite a long time.It is fun, touching, and a wonderful story about the art of Wing Chun."
2,A well woven tale,"This is the second Turow novel I've read and I'm hooked. He's an excellent story teller and really knows how to take a plot through unexpected twists and turns. This book is solid evidence of his skills and I recommend it heartily.I know how popular Grisham is and I've enjoyed some of his writing, but I'd rate Turow as easily the better writer. This book has plenty to help me reach that conclusion: family and business deceit, awkward romantic liasons, legal and personal grudges and jealousies, securities fraud, etc. Try it, I'll bet you'll like it."
2,Grows on you,"I too am a long-time fan of John Corbett. Loved him as Chris on Northern Exposure, loved him as Aidan on Sex & the City, and as Ian in Greek Wedding. Probably because he always plays a hunky sweet guy who's not stuck on himself and reminds me of my 20 year old son Evan, who's a sweetheart too. My first reaction to the cd was...just ok, but it began to really grow on me, especially after I watched the video of ""Good to Go"". John you're still a hottie and you have a great voice which always makes me think of all the good hearted guys you've played on the big screen."
2,Great Movie,Wanted is a great movie. The special effects are awesome. I think Angelina looks beautiful and I am totally loving her tattoos in the movie. Specially the one on her palm.
2,Worked Great,These are a great replacement in the SRT-4 compared to the high OEM prices. Thanks Moog.
2,My Favorite Product!,"NO BOTOX: *StriVectin-SD* 6 Oz [NEW GLOSSY Packaging, EXP.2009]: Anti-Aging Breakthrough. ERASE Face Wrinkles & Stretch-Marks. BEST-SELLER for 2nd Year in a Row.I use different lines of products, which I like. But I always apply Strivectin first. I also use it, of course, when I am not wearing makeup nor any other products.The ""why"" is that it leaves my skin feeling supple, never tight. I have combination skin, so I do not apply it to oily areas. It simply makes my skin feel healthy. I use just a little bit, and pat it on the dry areas and a big scar across my throat from surgery.I do not concur that it is ""better than botox"" or that it erases lines, unless they are lines from dry skin. It does not have the ingredients to do that! But it is the one product I can't live without!"
2,Another great show cut short,I hate that I'm always discovering TV shows that have been cancelled before they've really had time to develop the characters and plot. The Unusuals is darkly funny and witty; with characters that have depth and background. I'm disappointed that ABC cut this series short. Still a very fun watch!
2,No Need to Pay,"Don't buy it. It's on Youtube. It's great, funny, entertaining. Interesting. Touching. Cloud version of the odd man out. We've all been there. How to sum it up? It's on Youtube."
2,The music that light my day 3 years ago,"I love massive attack, is one of the most elegant and imaginative bands that i've heard in all my life, is really magical, is an album in a level that is above of the rest of music...is like a dream really."
2,If you loved the 60s...,"Author Shannon Greer demonstrates an uncanny remembrance for childhood and 1960s California, and an ability to make us remember too. With references to the music, styles and social mores of the time, she weaves a morbid mystery amongst the adventures of two tomboys from broken homes in Newport Beach.If you like a good mystery, you'll enjoy this horror tale; but even if you don't, you'll love wandering through a familiar era where skateboards, dime candy and first love loomed large on the prepubescent horizon. With humor and a sweet sympathy for her heroines, Greer deftly conveys the complexities inherent in ""tweenhood"" - even in a time and place where the only grit came from the beach."
2,"Interesting concept, hard to put down, deeply moving","This book has an interesting concept wherein the main character dies of a heart attack at the beginning of the book, then wakes up again as himself when he was a young college student. Through the story he keeps dying on the same date and time and coming back as himself -- hence the title <i>Replay</i>. Through the story he falls in and out of love during various replays, examines the meaning of life and love ...This was an engaging read. The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because somewhere in the middle I felt like giving up the book all together. It was becoming a little repetitive. My husband read it before me and I actually said, ""just tell me what happens in the end, I don't want to read this anymore."" He refused to tell me. Well, I finished the book and was glad I did -- riding through the few pages that weren't enjoyable, the pages that dragged. It was very deeply moving and in the end was well worth reading."
2,Excelent brick wall set,"These brick walls go perfectly with 1/35 soldiers. These are not sandbox items or something to add to your kids collection of toys. As for the standing up comment, lay a perfectly straight real brick wall 10 bricks high on solid ground without any sort of foundation and see how long that stands. Without something to hold them down a little angle on the pieces can go a long way."
2,I LIKEY! GOOD FOR YOUNGER KIDS TOO!,"Well, I think this movie was great! I watched it with the kids I sit for, and they just loved it! I recommend it for ages 7-11. Heehee 7-11! :) Tis a good one!"
2,Great bargain if you are starting out,"OK. Bottom line, this is a great deal. I just bought my house and needed all the tools to go with it. Every thing worked as advertised. I trimmed and edged, then trimmed the hedges and ""swept"" up the mess with one battery. I agree the blower is not that powerful but it is not a leaf blower, but a sweeper. Love it."
2,A fascinating look into The Secret Service of the Confederate States in Europe,"This book takes us on a journey into an almost unknown side of the American Civil War. While historians have argued over which great land battle was the so called ""high water mark of the Confederacy"", the author makes it obvious that events taking place on the high seas and in the halls of European power had a greater impact on the outcome of America's bloodiest war.The late historian Shelby Foote stated that you can't understand American history without understanding the Civil War. I would add that you can't understand the Civil War without understanding the naval and international aspects of that conflict. This book is the best on that subject."
2,Crazy....the best song ever,"As a 67 year old woman, I thought I would be turned off by the rest of the songs on this CD, but only the first one got on my last nerve. The rest I really enjoyed. But Crazy really got me going....."
2,the magician's nephew,great audio cd. it is a movie in sound and my family enjoys listening to it again and again. it is great for the car. better than the radio and a nice break from the television.
2,Historically Acurate,"This is probably THE best religious film I have ever seen. Normally I complain about them, and they are usually done very low budget with completely unknown actors who cannot act. Joseph, however was done very well. The sets were historically accurate, and the filmmakers made sure to put detail into everything they did. They also left nothing out. Every little detail from the Joseph story is here, in their greusome details. Ben Kingsley does an excellent job as Potiphar and Potiphars wife is equally good and vile. Joseph himself is everything you would expect Joseph to be, humble, handsome, smart, and spiritual. Wonderfully Done."
2,listen to my last words anywhere,"serendipity. very cool mixture of Hiphopricy's jazz/funk/hiphop grooves and Burrough's always ahead-of-his-time future rants, stream-o-conciousness, and political concerns. whoever thought of this idea was an absolute genius. the production is top notch, and often collides with what Burroughs is talking about in a hilarious or bizarre manner. interesting guest stars too. Ras I Zulu. shooty yeah. out before Dr.Octagon's futuristic blend of wacked-ot lyrics and spaced beats would evolve hiphop two years later. a crucial ingredient. burroughs, disposable hereoes of hiphopricy. burroughs, kurt cobain. these collaborations are priceless."
2,Awesome price,I go through these like crazy. Came with a case to hold them. Cant beat the price. They can get expensive if you keep buying 5 or 10 packs. Wont have to buy for a while now. @ndreas
2,VECTOR TWIN BEAM 20 MILLION CANDLE POWER,"This spot light is very bright i'm glad I bought it but it takes a very long time to charge, around 35 hours. will use at the house all the time but will nerver take hunting. If you need a good spot light this is it but the charge time is bad. I was useing it out in a large field and could see objects over 200 yeards away."
2,Chucky loves his house!,"My 90 lb. pitbull Chucky, a foster dog, loves this doghouse. I will find him outside laying in it even though he has freedom to come in thru his doggy door. I have to beg him to leave it and come sleep in the house at night, and sometimes he prefers to stay in it. It is sturdy, very very inexpensive compared to others, and extra roomy, with lots of space for air circulation. I just tossed a thin cushion into it and he loves laying in there. Best money spent in years."
2,A True Artist Work Straight From the Heart,:D I absolutely love her new album. It shows truly the artist she is because it comes straight from her heart. She wrote most of her songs about her experiences and it shows what an awsome person and performer she is. I think that everybody should go out and buy a copy. Thanks :D
2,"Good, not great","Typical for LCD, the set is very well defined--picture wise--but lacks the flair that plasma has. Thus, it does not impress except to acknowledge the good definition and lack of burn-in.It was a good price; ""quality"" sets in this size were $100-$200 more; even Sony's Bravia later series(the newer models) were the same difference more. You could get a 32"" set of non-name brand for the same price, but would be taking a chance on warranty support and picture quality."
2,Loved it!,"I thought this book was just great, it was very readable, and fast paced and as far as the action went, I thought it was as near to classic Doctor Who as we'll see. I didn't notice it being overly gory, it wasn't like it was out of context. When a vicious alien race bent on conquering the planet plops down in the middle of town, wouldn't you expect some bloodshed? I enjoyed the characters, I thought they were reasonably believable."
2,"It sounds like what it looks like.......urban,modern jazz","I bought this one because of Christian McBride,but it's nothing like his own CDs,but I enjoy it a lot! Urban sound,nice groove,a mix of funk/soul/jazz"
2,"no more hunger, fear, or a-bombs...","It's a shame the Hangdogs aren't recording together anymore. This album was their best. The title track is the anchor of the album. It sounds like an outtake from Pete Seeger (who actually toured with Wallace during the '48 campaign). If you're in to alt-country/americana you ought to pick this one up. And if any of you Hangdogs are reading this review, how's about getting the band back together?"
