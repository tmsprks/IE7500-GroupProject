1,Bad Wire,"For 6 hours I thought it was the way I was hooking something up ,only to find out it was a bad wire...I had to go and buy another wire the next day...I had already disposed of the package it came in...This might be my lesson with wires online..."
1,Palm has already ripped on the right hand.,"I used these for work and about after a month, the padding on the right hand pad has already ripped. Nice and light weight but a bit on the cheap side."
1,"Predictable, boring, not worth the time and effort","I was very disappointed in this book. After the first fivechapters, I couldn't go any further. Rather than trash what Ihad paid good money for, I attempted to give this book away to one of my friends who might would have a different opinion. Nodice--couldn't even give it away. Sorry to say but I could haveread something of similar nature, or better, for free in mylocal newspaper. I apologize for this poor review because theauthor's husband is one of my favorite writers."
1,Book is horrible,This book is a rehash of the previous version. It is full of quick tips without much substance. There are many books out there now that are much better. It seems that Rita relies on her inside information with PMI as a selling tool. Will not help you to be a project manager and is more like a boot camp full of things like study this cause it is on the test. lacks comprehension for understanding PMP principles. As a PMP I find these quick books not worthwhille
1,If you were on the fence,"If you haven't really read enough about the Evolution vs Creationism conflict in America to have a strong opinion, or if you're sitting on the fence then you must see this film. The nonsensical propaganda that Stein spouts will make you realize how phony creationism is. On the other hand if Stein convinces you he speaks the truth, well then don't worry you have bigger problems in life, like tying your shoes and counting to numbers above 10."
1,NON/ANTI/PSEUDO-Catholic Digest,"If you are looking for Catholic news, culture, spirituality, history, apologetics, liturgical updates, or DOCTRINE, THIS is certainly NOT the magazine for you.The articles featured in Cath.Dig. are HETERODOX (not orthodox), and stray -- in tendency or in explicit terms -- from the Magisterium of the Church.Anti-Christian Feminism, Homosexual Activism, and general Modernist Revisionism and a rebellious ""anti-Dogmalism"" pervade the pages of ""Catholic"" Digest, though often (but not always) with veiled language.For Catholics trying to get their faith straight, or Protestants and non-Catholics trying to find out more about what the Christian Faith is all about, STAY AWAY from this publication!!As a cleric and a pastor of the Flock of God, I strongly urge you NOT to purchase this magazine.The Rev. Enzo G. Selvaggi"
1,Not what I ordered,"I ordered the new version of Star Trek with Chris Pine. Unfortunately, I received a 3 discs of old Star Trek movies that im not in to. The covers were virtually identical. So be careful if you order this."
1,bigbenoutlet@hotmail.com,"The JVC DRMV1S arrived defective. The remote was alsodefective. I sent it to JVC to be repaired, whichsince that time, has been repaired by JVC, and working."
1,Wrong part,"Like another customer, I also received the male portion of the lighter socket instead of the product shown. Looks well made, but not what I was looking for. Living overseas, not worth my time to try to send it back.. just going to go with another maker with the hope they can send the correct parts."
1,Terrible!,"I am a reading tutor for grades 1-3, and I thought my students may enjoy trying some reading games - I gave them a try first and they were so poorly organized, I won't even let my students try. The ""phonics"" are never said by the computer for the student - it shows a cat for short a, but doesn't tell you the specific sound that short a makes - not acceptable! There is also no way to pick a specific phonic or game for a student to work on - you just load the cd and have to go through the games, 1 by 1.... This is going back to the store! If I could give it ZERO stars, I would..."
1,Doesn't Work,A waste of time and not worth the frustration. Not sturdy or adjustable enough to hold the crappy projector it came with. Waste of money.
1,Agree that is awful,"This game is incomprehensible. It has no help section so I can't run it. I have gotten far enough to see the uniforms are backwards, but I don't how to run it or what to do next. Total ripoff. Not worth a penny. I am going to throw it away and delete it from computer.It gets one star because there are no zero stars."
1,Worthless,"I have purchased this item twice, replacing the first because I thought it was defective. On both occasions, I would get the short low battery chirp a few weeks after purchase.I called customer service and the gentleman informed me that I should use Eveready batteries exclusively! He made this sound like it was perfectly normal?! Unacceptable! Can't use Duracell? Forget about trying to use a rechargable battery to save money.I've sent the second unit back to Amazon. Nuff said."
1,This Jane Eyre--- errs.,"This is a fabulously lush orchestrated and sung piece of bubblegum. I think Charlotte Bronte, the cast, and the audience deserve a much more lyrical piece. This hodge-podge of contemporary styles has been packaged well--- however it is not cohesive, and therefore it is a HUGE disappointment. Great voices, great orchestrations, great musical direction--- really poor score. I can understand WHY it's having trouble--- and after years of finetuning, it is still fatally flawed and unlike Rochester, this musical can not be redeemed even by such a fabulous Jane Eyre. This Jane Eyre--- errs, and I am left with why?"
1,Unreliable Drivers,"I won't go into details on my specific experiences, but I'll chime in with those that have complained about the software. It's bloated, containing about 5 different programs that all pretty much get you to the same place. It's unhealthy in that I often find myself having to kill HP processes while I'm shutting down and they take entirely too long to start up. Worst of all it's unreliable. I want to print when I want to print. I don't want to have to reboot or futz around with configurations to get the printer to stop giving me errors.The hardware is solid which is the only reason it gets more than one star when I'm going to throw it away while it still works just to get rid of my software problems. It's a real shame.Oh yea, and the replacement will probably *not* be an HP."
1,Adam Sandler dissapoints,"I gernerally like Adam Sandler movies but have grown wary of them,his character is someone he always tries to make the good guy who's successful but humble,always does the right thing,etc.Then there's this guy,the most irritating character he has,you've seen and heard him over the years.Not much(except the actors themselves) about this movie is good,I tried to watch it over the 24 hours it was rented for several times but lost interest,fell asleep,etc.It's a ""comedy"" but it's not that funny and the premise is ridiculous."
1,Ditto...,"As the other reviewers have pointed out, this is simply Budig's Aim True DVD with a different cover. Shameful trickery by Gaiam."
1,Don't waste your money,Too bad they don't have a zero rating. This article is highly overpriced. Aprox 700 words and no meat whatsoever.
1,katie,I saw Katie perform on PBS. I love how she sounds when she sings far away voice. The rest of her songs aren't so good due to the goofy lyrics and her childish voice. If she gets better material then more people would know about her.
1,I NEVER RECEIVED THIS!,I needed this to begin the school year as I teach in a new high school. To date I still have not received the product -
1,Poor PS/2 connection ports,"I've been having a terrible time with getting my PS/2 keyboard and mouse to stay plugged into the PS/2 ports on this switch. I've never had a problem pluging into any other PS/2 ports but my keyboard and mouse keep slipping out of the ports on this KVM switch and as a result I keep loosing all connectivity.I've even tried plugging an adapter into the ports to see if that would help, but nothing seems to stay into the ports without slipping out. I was looking to see if there was some way to reduce the size of the port opening but it does not look feasible. I even tried strapping my devices in place with rubber bands but the ports are just too slack.I've given up on this product."
1,Less than one star,Tripe like this should be banned. All the fundie movement does is make all problems the fault of the woman. God forbid a MAN be held responsible for their behavior.
1,BAD DECISION,"This was one of the worst items I have ever bought on the web. There is no way to keep it fastened to the faucet. When you tighten it to the faucet and turn the water on, the plastic disk attached to the hose blows out the bottom of the ring around the outside faucet and you have no way to keep the hose connected to the faucet. Not worth having."
1,One of the bad movies starring Jackie Chan,It's one of the bad movies starring Jackie Chan. It's not funny. The fighting scenes are below par compared to other films of Jackie.
1,When Hollywood makes a movie about ... NOTHING !,"When you see the casting, you just expect a great movie and I guess the acting is the only thing positive in it.When the movie starts in a really cool and interesting way and when you know that you have 3 hours movie to watch, you just think ""What a great moment I am ready to enjoy"". The problem is that everything is turning out and you finally get bored after half an hour.The story is about .... Love, Pride, Hope ... and it's completely flat, flat, flat ! It just happens nothing except a frog rain at the end that also means nothing ! It's for sure one of the most boring movies of my life. The one star rate is really for the actors only ! The rest is garbage !"
1,Very Disappointing,"I was really looking forward to reading this book, based on its premise, and the other reviews. I hoped it would expand and enlighten my own unarticulated thoughts on the human animal, and its disconnect from the natural world. I was so disappointed that the book, in my opinion, failed to really explore and run with this large and very important issue. I found the writing difficult, and it often seemed that Livingston was writing for an academic journal, and was mainly interested in discussing and rebutting esoteric points with his fellow ecologists, rather than exploring a larger and broader view of his subject for the general audience to whom the book was intended. I found the book tedious and repetitive, and a chore to read. The infrequent moments when the author did actually write clearly about his larger theme of humans as a species cut off from nature tended to be sarcastic quips against society, which I thought diminished the points he was trying to make."
1,Bad design,My experience is the same as the other two reviewers. VERY difficult to securely screw the provided aluminum disks into these plastic pieces to maintain correct wheel camber.
1,IT DOESNT WORK CONSISTENTLY,"This watch will work well for a while and then start giving you bad readings. Like 50bph in the middle of a spinning class, and the 145bph and the 25bph.... I've tried many things to get it to work properly, (changing position of the band, etc) but it works when it wants. I believe the problem is the band, not the watch itself...Spend more money and get somrthing that actually works well for more than 1 week."
1,Focus JILLIAN!,"As always Jillian knows how to rev it up from the start. My only complaint is she tends to joke then pause to laugh, yell at her buddies, then laugh, etc...way too much for my liking. I tried to ignore it but by the time I got to DVD 3 it was annoying the heck out of me. I'm very close to getting these dvds edited to cut out her constant goofing. I rather get an instructor that is focused on the most important person, me, the consumer."
1,"Seriously, Honeywell!? Styrofoam componentry & NO AIR FLOW!?","I have three other Honeywell air filters (I'll put in model numbers later - two of one model and one of another model) and they're all really very good. This one, however, mystifies me because the internal fan cowl is made of styrofoam, and not even high density styrofoam, it's similar to to what the unit came packed in for shipping. Even if that's acceptable on some deranged level of engineering logic (I'm sure management thinks this is just nifty) - the air flow from this thing is pitiful! The smallest honeywell unit I have pushes five times the output on high than this one does on high. This thing is going back, asap. On that note, thanks Amazon for making returns hassle free and easy!!UPDATE:I bought this one instead, it's been working great for 45 days straight on Medium or High.Honeywell 50250-S 99.97% Pure HEPA Round Air Purifier"
1,Could have been better . . .,"This book had a lot of information, to it's credit. I found quite a bit of material that seemed to be copied right out of the Visual Basic 6 help documentation. Also, I was disturbed to find I was reading multiple paragraphs over again, because they were repeated in the book verbatim multiple times. I found the DAO/ADO sections, to be useful, but no the ODBC sections. I also found a few (less than 5) coding errors."
1,Tears my bills.,"I just got the clip today. I was surprised by how light it was but certainly can live with that. My issue is, that the clip area, when it closes, tears the bills. If I take the time to keep everything inline, which I certainly won't do, it scrunches the bills keeping them from laying flat.I am VERY disappointed."
1,Worst movie I have ever seen.,"This movie absolutely [stinks], there's nothing more I can say. Even the ""un-rated super uncut uncensored blah blah"" version wouldn't save this [movie]. I hate the person who wrote it and the [person] who took on the task of directing it. I wanted to rip my eyes out every time I saw the tall, blonde ""[villain]"" Save your money, don't even rent this garbage, go see something more productive, like a grass-growing contest."
1,Very shallow and not worth reading,"Someday an excellent biography of Laura Bush will be written, but this isn't it.Indeed, this book is a great disappointment. It is shallow and uncritical; a ""puff-piece"" that could have been written by White House operatives or the Republican National Committee, either of which might have done a better job; short and amateurish; and it contains ""filler"" material about book festivals and the like that absorbs many of its 200 pages.Having read Julia Reed's June 2001 article in Vogue just before picking up this book, I was astounded by the difference between a well-written, insightful piece of writing and this wasted effort. It is clear that the author merely parroted other writers and provided little that we didn't know already about the lovely and talented Mrs. Bush.Surely Our First Lady deserves better than this. Even ""Millie's Book"" was a better read."
1,Not the quality I expected,"I bought this item expecting to get something of better quality than I did. The hose, the valve and the blow gun were on the cheap side. The cylinder itself seems to be the only component that had any real lasting quality of materials in it. Whatever standards this AC System Flush Kit was built to, must have been very minimal. I would't recommend purchasing this kit."
1,RIP OFF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,PLEASE DO NOT ORDER THE PIECE OF GARBAGE!!!!!! The movie is only 25 min. long. Then there is about 45 min. of behind the scenes footage that shows nothing but extended scenes of clips from the movie. The movie is about a mad who kills women. Shooting them mostly There is no plot. That is it. I'M SERIOUS!!!!! When we do see him killing the women the effect are horrible. The scenes of the dead bodies. You can see the actors breathing and eyes moving. I can not believe Amazon wants to sell it for $17.00. It isn't worth $0.07. DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE BECAUSE IT IS NOT REALLY A MOVIE. By the way. Whenever you see a DVD cover like the one pictured. You know it is nothing like the movie.
1,Be Careful!,"I bought the Avent bottles and the bottle warmer. First, the bottles spill...my son had milk all over his shirt and there was a big mess. I thought it was just that one bottle so I tried another bottle (I had 4 Avent bottles) the same thing happened. I wrote avent informing them of the prooblem...I received no reply except 2 weeks later I received a bottle from Avent in the mail...tried it and it spilled. I gave up and bought its cometitor Dr. Brown...PERFECT, NO SPILLING AND A DRY WELL FED BABY! sECOND, i BOUGHT THE aVENT BOTTLE WARMER...BE CAREFUL THIS IS A FIRE HAZARD. The warmer light turns off but the machine is still on! There is no automatic shut off even though the warmer looks like it is off! Be carefull...I threw this out as well."
1,Fabric,The synopsis says cotton pajamas. These are not cotton. They are 100% nylon. The description of these pajamas needs to be corrected!
1,NOTHING NEW HERE,"DON'T BUY THIS RIP OFF DVD! THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING NEW HERE. CLIPS FROM SHINDIG, WHERE THE ACTION IS, ENGLISH TV, FRENCH TV, AND GERMAN TV. QUALITY IS NO BETTER OR WORSE THAN PREVIOUSLY AVAILABLE VERSIONS. IT APPEARS THERE WILL NEVER BE A HIGH QUALITY YARDBIRDS RETROSPECTIVE DVD."
1,Uncommunicative singing,"Russell Watson's singing is so uncommunicative! How can he claim to be a ""people's tenor"" when he sings in such a charmless manner?I don't mind any technical defects of Russell Watson which some others claim that he has. But I'm really annoyed when the singing does not care to invest his singing with feeling. Watson doesn't seem to understand what he is singing - he merely produces the sound. Can this be termed good singing? I don't think so."
1,Hate with a capital H,"I bought these based on the Amazon reviews, but can't stand 'em. The sound is thin and harsh -- I had to push them in halfway to my brain to hear any bass at all, and man is it uncomfortable, even with the smallest rubber bits. The earbuds that came with the ipod hurt, but at least they sound alright.Maybe it's just discomfort with earbuds in general, I don't know. The one positive thing I will say is the little over-the-ear hooks work well at keeping them in place. But these are going back."
1,Hype for the authors....,"The ""story"" portion of this book, which is printed on all of the right-hand pages, is truly mawkish. It wouldn't make it as a stand-alone novel, so it gets to tag along here. The usual ""millionaire"" ideas are proffered, although I believe that it will be the authors who reap all the benefits. They are getting richer, while money is paid for their goods, and the would-be millionaires are led down one more ""garden path to riches."" It still takes money to make money--unless you have a fantiastic backer and benefactor. Save YOUR money, and don't throw it away here. (Also, trying to access their website to get the ""free bonus offers"" is next-to-impossible. So much for getting something additional after the initial purchase!)"
1,Lamb dressed as beef,"While beautifully presented this atlas lacks detail and current information. It quotes the global population to be 5.5 Billion. The national biographies are sparse and better guides are available, for example the ""SBS World Guide"". Overall dissappointing, a good gift for a 12 year old. A little bit more effort would have produced a great product."
1,"Give Verdi a chance, he is not that bad.","I thought this kind of junk could be found only on progressive opera houses. Forget about the plot. If you have seen La Traviata or Camille you've got it (including the spitting blood and the throwing of money to the courtesan in public, not to forget the recriminating old father). The formal originality consists on mixing a Ken Russell inflated musical with unrestrained bits from a Franco Zefirelli production. In the added material Nicole Kidman enlightens us about the moving force of this enterprise: love can be expressed in music better than in any other genre. The only advantage over La Traviata is that we are spared listening to 'Di Provenza il mare il sol', an aria I hate more than any other. Thanks to that I can honestly say that yes, I liked the music."
1,Have to bring that rating down,"I wasn't going to review this thing -- wasn't worth the effort. But then I saw it averaged three-and-a-half stars and thought I should do my part to bring that down, and to warn potential buyers. Don't get me wrong about Stephen King: Some of his books have brought me more enjoyment than those of any other author. But certainly not this one. King has tried here to get inside the heads of senior citizens and fails miserably; his characters seem to be some 13-year-old boy's idea of what ""cool"" geezers might be like. When King is at his best (read Misery), he goes light on the supernatural and heavy on the realistic suspense. When he's at his worst (read this one) he has cartoon characters spouting (literally) cartoon balloons above their heads. Did Cujo scare you? How about Carrie? Me, too. But hey, wait until you meet up with King's singing tennis shoes in this piece of junk -- sounds scary, doesn't it? Not."
1,Waste of Money!!!!,We were so excited to use this... rushed home and got the bath tub all ready... the thig woekrd for maybe 2 montues and then never again produced another bubble. So Sad. :(
1,Horrendous,"That rendition of Jump in the Fire is terrible. I'm offended. Don't buy this, its a crime."
1,Very frustrated!,"I admit I am a newbie at graphics programs, but I have not been able to do even basic text editing with this one.I have been struggling for weeks just to get some decent-looking text onto the canvas. The controls are mystifying, the ""manual"" is a thin little brochure and the online support has still not responded to me after 10 days and 2 e-mails. I really wasted my money and will have to find a new program now."
1,"Deceptively soothing until whammo, a jungle cat roars!","This starts out nicely with the humming sounds of insects, wind in the trees, and rain drops hitting the leaves of the plants below. Recording quality is well-done, the sounds of a stream are introduced a few minutes later (interfering with the imagery) as in ""where in the hell did this stream come from?"" Just as you're about to drift off to sleep a very loud roar comes out of nowhere, jolting you awake. I'm assuming it's a jaguar that got bored. This is not the CD for relaxation or meditation or sleeping. It's a good one for playing a joke on people, that's about it."
1,Who wants to be a goddess?,"I really didn't like this video at all. It moved along to quickly, she can't count correctly, the warm up and cool down wasn't very exciting, each segment was only about 5 minutes long with more emphasis on her outfit changes, the camera focused on her face when she was demonstrating hips, and her talk about bellydancing and awakening the goddess with-in is annoying, along with the super imposed images of her doing neck rolls. I would definetly not buy this video again. I feel like it was a total waste of money and I wish I could return it."
1,Indian Cookbook,This was one of my daughter's favorite gifts for Christmas. She is already looking for receipes to try when she gets home.
1,And these packaging terrors surprise who???!!,"If TRU.com somehow acquired the exclusive rights to produce all things Star Wars, I would quit collecting Star Wars. I have NEVER ordered anything from TRU.com that did not have to be returned for a replacement. NEVER! After SIX times, there will not be a number seven.I HOPE that you folks learned a lesson and I HOPE that those who are interested in this figure read these reviews. There is only ONE way to get this unacceptable practice to stop - and that's to stop giving TRU.com our money. If more collectors demand better, we will get better. Until then, get used to it.When in doubt, spend a couple of extra bucks, go to an online retailer or eBay seller you know and trust and get your piece of mind and your collectible figure intact. www.alliancecollectibles.com; www.cloudcitycollectibles.com; and others. They'll do you right.J"
1,Did not meet my needs.,"After looking at the information listed, I thought this would work for my 16 inch flatscreen TV to use in my trailer. However it did not tilt downward far enough. The company sent it in a huge box, wanted it returned in original packing and would not send a postage paid return label. Amazon had to help me out. If you do not need good downward tilt then this would be a good choice for you."
1,Harder then the first one!,"It's another video where she is just jumping around for an hour! It's done in a better setting than the last video, but it is extremely hard! Be careful! You also need lots of space to move around."
1,Surprisenly mellow and moody and boring,"If you are buying this album after listening to 4 Non Blondes and hope this is volume 2, skip it. While Linda Perry is an outstanding vocalist, this one doesn't rock. It doesn't skip either. An unfortunate sophomoric effort."
1,Total piece o' .....,"To echo some other reviewers, my unit skips terribly on the cds it will even play. Also, the motor to open the cd door on top isn't strong enough. After about a month of use it became manually operated. Don't waste your money"
1,Misleading Specs,"Web site descriptions claim item works with most home phones. NOT true. Once you receive item and read instructions, you find out that the item will not work with phones where the keypad is in the handset. This is most phones now a days. So it doesn't work, and vendors want 20% restock fee and tracked shipping. You end up losing half the purchase price just to return it."
1,NOT a dog toy,"We had one of these for our cat, which our standard poodle puppy adopted as his own. He spent many an hour chewing on the toy until it finally broke apart.After some shopping in the local stores (no one carried it anymore), we found this online.The good part is that he immediately recognized it and wanted to play right away. He lay down on his pillow and commenced gnawing away. Unfortunately, the puppy had grown into a dog - there is a slight difference between a 10 pound puppy and a 50 pound adolescent dog. The dog blew this toy up in under five minutes.So, jingle toy - good. Chew toy - bad."
1,Cheap plastic backing,"I like the top of the mattress pad, but the vinyl backing is very cheap. The first time that I washed and dried this cover the plastic tore. I now have holes all over the back of the mattress pad. Don't waste your money."
1,Bore me till I cry,"This album is extremely boring. Dismal, slow lyrics put me too sleep. How many more bands can possibly write about suicide and other depressing issues? Is everybody depressed these days or what? If you want some upbeat music, go with POD's new Satellite album. ""It's been a while since I heard good musiiiccc from Staind....(Singing)....LOL! I can think of at least a dozen new bands who insist on writing crappy music. Hopefully, this new mainstream writing will cease."
1,Lord of the Flie videos,"Not true to the book. Details are in modern times such as the kids missing tv. Theme is correct but the rest is not credible for someone who has read the book. A helicopter rescues the kids in the end, instead of a war ship is just one example. Scenery and costumes are believable. Some of the goriest detalis are left out. OK for younger kids who would not be allowed to read the book."
1,For the young reader.,TH and B has limited value as a history. It is very light reading and more suited to the young reader.
1,A so-so history,"This book does not help me with the specific data I was looking for, ie: the famine of 1720s and ancient history. The author totally ignores the famine of the 1720s. He does give me a good sequence of the earlist populations, though very brief."
1,Tasteless and mediocre,"I thought this was good, after all their first Ep is quite cool. Big mistake! ""In a reverie"" is painfully dumb! Most of it is mediocre heavy rock that tries to emulate the contrast between clean female and gruff male vocals which other bands did successfully, but Lacuna Coil fails miserably in doing so. This album lacks excitement, originality, good riffs, and decent lyrics.Stay away from it!"
1,"Good at first, but broke after 2 months","So, I was attracted to these earphones because of the price. They seemed like a great deal but the poor quality construction was evident right off the bat. The first pair that I ordered were broken during delivery (right near the top of the ""U""-shaped arm holding the phones in place) so I had to get another pair. They worked great for about 2 moths but after even gentle handling, they finally broke and are now not usable.I'd recommend them only if you get a *really* great deal, but even then, expect to replace them soon."
1,Good in theory,"My 13 month old son loves this, but I unfortunately have to echo the comments that it's poorly made. The saw dust went away after a bit, and I can live with the fact that the pieces can sometimes be difficult to put in, but the biggest problem is that my son is chewing the paper off the top of the pieces. It's kind of shocking actually, that they would manufacture a product that could be chewed away so easily when the product is geared toward children that are likely to put things in their mouths! I'll probably end up throwing it out shortly, but I'm hoping to find a replacement from a different company before I do. Bottom line is that I would never buy this again or gift it to anyone I cared about."
1,only good for spark plugs. hardly a grease,if you need to actually GREASE something that must be dielectric (insulated) this is NOT it.Very Thick. the drag on this grease is extremely high. It's pretty much silicone glue without the hardening agent.
1,Apex Roman / Hyper Extension Bench,"Machine is well constructed but should have been made adjustable - also, no instructiuons were included and after having contacted the company to request instructions, I have never heard from them"
1,Thoughts of someone whose mother used this book,"My mother was given this book while I was a child. Wanting to raise a well-behaved child, she would spank me with a belt. She is proud of me. I am a senior at Princeton University and practicing Catholic. However, today my mother would tell you that I am these things in spite of the teachings of ""To Train Up a Child,"" in spite of the self-loathing and insecurity caused by whippings which would not end until I could pretend to be content. Pretend to embrace the necessity for my own torture.I was abused. Please do not look to this book for guidance."
1,Not really the Byrds,"Short and sweet, this album just never worked for my ears. I fell in love with The Byrds with the first album and hung with them through the changes in line-up and styles (yeah, I even liked Byrdmaniax) but this one just fell flat. Only a couple oftunes even sound Byrd-like and the rest just sort of lay there and make you wonder what was going on in the groups head when they listened to the playbacks. If you're a Byrd fan then thiseffort will more than likely disappoint you in a big way. If youare just getting into the group, this album will make you wonderwhat all the hub-bub was about. Trust me: They were so muchbetter than this effort shows. Stick to the earlier stuff or thegreatest hits/best of/ esstiential packages."
1,Knife of Dreams Not worth the Money,"Same old, same old.The politics are boring, the description of every object ad nauseum is mind numbing and the characters are the same cookie-cutter characters that fill all of Jordan's other novels.Do not buy this novel. Start Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire series instead and enjoy mature, complex, and exciting characters along with a gripping storyline for a change."
1,Impressive music but BORING and almost TOO Technical,I love Tech Death Metal but this CD just isn't for everyone. IMO this CD will test even the most hardened tech death metal fans chops. Just not enough riffage for my taste. Beware all the 5 star reviews you might just hate this CD.
1,Disappointed,"The box didn't come with the nuts and bolts needed to assemble it - AND there are really no instructions, just a small slip of paper with a diagram of how it should go together. I felt incompetent not being able to figure out how it should go together, but then I saw that there were no bolts in the package even if I could manage to put it together with the diagram. (Returning this of course)."
1,It sucks!,"I wish I could rate it as zero star.For no reason at all, it just stopped working after 13 months.I am wondering if that's why they only been given 12 months of warranty.Also, the paint started to come off on the first day.A piece of junk!!!"
1,HEAVY...BUT GETS OLD FAST...,"Honestly,I only bought this because the name of the band was very original. The guitar,drums,and vocals are nothing we haven't heard a thousand times before. Nothing but growling and the same guitar in every song. To bad the CD isn't as original as the name. SORRY GUYS! nothing great here."
1,repeats a few tips over ad nauseum,repeats 'paint with spots of colour' throughout the book. doesn't say much of anything beyond that. weak.if you are looking for a book with tons of great advice and solid mental approaches to painting i recommend 'painting secrets from a master' by david leffel. The title is cheesy but the painting advice is great for people into realism.
1,Cheap plastic,"The instructions say that you can bend the plastic piece to fit inside the tank, well, it broke when I tried bending it. The company won't respond to emails either."
1,"Nasty, crass, crude, rude, and tasteless",Sue Grafton lacks taste and tact. She is as crass as any merchant marine. Her language is distasteful and offending. Her unnecessary scene details and followups both offend and affront. I will not purchase another of her books.
1,Below Average,"You'd be better off with Sonic Youth or Dinosaur Jr. Still warrents 2 stars because of the time period. It is like over produced, studio-tized punk. Like the idea, but can't get into it."
1,Disappointed,"After all the wonderful reviews, I decided to try Cooking Mama out. It didn't last long; I played it for about five minutes and proceeded to forget about it for a week before trading it it for Yoshi's Island DS.Visually, there's really nothing ""wrong"" with the game; the graphics are great. The controls, though, are clunky and counterintuitive. It seems to take forever to learn how to do some of the techniques, and by the time I practiced enough to learn how to do it for real, I had lost interest and tried to move on to nothing else.But that's the worst part of the game; there is nothing else. The minigames are as dry as the rest of the game, and there's really nothing else to scream about.If you're huge into anime style graphics and games that make heavy use of the stylus, buy this game by all means. Just don't be surprised when it bores the life out of you."
1,"The Frost's are mercenary, New Age sell-outs","If there has not been sufficient evidence that the Frosts are mercenary hacks, this book is the smoking gun. This book is insulting. It is ""rewritten"", rehashed trash, marketed to modern day ""Good Witches"" and pawned off as something original. If, Gavin and Yvonne, you are so hard up for cash, open a lemonade stand or buy a 1*900 number like everyone else. Don't insult my intelligence."
1,Sanyo 4700 Car charger,"Shipping was fast, customer service was good. The item received was the wrong item, it seems to be that they didn't have what i was looking for so they sent a different item in it's place. I sent it back for a return with no questions asked."
1,Mildly interesting and slow paced,I'm amazed I was able to stay awake for this movie. The story line could have been more creative. It seemed like they had to reach for ideas on how to fill time.
1,Glad I Didn't Buy This Book,"If this is representative of Schaeffer's other works, it astounds me that he's considered such a great apologeticist. I borrowed this book from the library and read through it five times in three weeks, and was just as confused when I finished the fifth reading as I was when I started the first one. The big turn-off for me was in the very first chapter, with the author's free mixing of his own jargon with philosophical and psychological jargon. If I was someone sitting on the fence as far as Christianity was concerned, the first thing that would enter my brain would be, If it's THIS complicated, I don't want anything to do with it. For that reason, I won't be buying any of Mr. Schaeffer's books, and wouldn't recommend this book to anyone who was just starting out in Christianity. A better starter, IMHO, is Lewis' Mere Christianity."
1,Warranty is A Joke,I bought the Wearever Cookware set and an additional Large stainless steel non-stick frying pan. I could have paid more but they had a lifetime guarantee and they were cheaper. I now know why they are cheaper! There warranty is a joke! You pay for shipping back to the manufacturer under their warranty and then they deny the claim due to heat. They ship it back to you. I will no longer due business with this company for weaseling out of their warranty. They also manufacture Mirror products. Pay the difference and get a set that lasts! This company is not worthy of your business unless you like over paying for under performing products!
1,DOESN''T WORK,"I paid 12.00 dollars for this item at a beach side convenience store and it just doesn't work at all. It does not stand up ON it's own for a child to fill it and no matter what you fill it with ie.( sand, water, rice) the mechanisms just don't move! The hole seems big enough to make it move but it just doesn't and your child will be very dissappointed."
1,not recommended,"I tried SWG figuring that a taste of Starwars might really be fun. The major problem with this game is the whole engine is just a rip off of World of Warcraft. World of Warcraft has far better graphics, content, and balance. Both of these games cost the same each month, so you might as well just pick the better game. I read some good reviews on this game and I honestly don't know what those people were talking about. There are less than 200K people playing SWG now, and over 5 million people playing WoW. Like I said, stick to WoW."
1,"Low Quality, Not recommended","This product went on okay, at first, but when I went to go out later in the night I noticed that the light that came through the windshield was extremely hazed. Thinking I had overapplied it, I followed instructions to clean it up. This had no noticed effect. It took me 5 attempts to (mostly) get it removed. I would not recommend this product."
1,YUK!,"Every Walden Farms calorie-free product I tried was terrible, including this one. It's not just that it's not as good as ""the real thing,"" but it is truly AWFUL! Don't waste your money."
1,Chisum Movie Too Far Off,"This has to be the worst view of a real character Hollywood, and especially John Wayne, ever produced. The names I recognize, but the story is so far off. They could have named it something else, and used a fictional character. Chisum's life is interesting enough w/o pasting it with so many falsehoods, including his relationship or non-relationship with William Bonney. I tried to watch it after so many years, but it was like Home from the Hill....really worthless except for the background scenery."
1,Why I don't buy abridgments,"This work only confirmed my belief that I must quit buying abridgments. The original 3 volume set is so much more complete. One only gets a hint of the original with this balderization. If I want an abridgment, I'll do it myself. Amazon, please get the original set on Kindle."
1,"IT IS DESEPTIVE ,","IT IS NOT WHAT I THOUGHT IT WASIT DOSE FIT THE CAMRA BUT I THOUGHT THAT IT HAD A USB END ALSO , SO THAT I COULD HOOK TO MY COMPUTER"
1,Another bad book from Perret,"Having studied Ike for 30 years, I am disappointed in this book from Mr. Perret. There are so many sloppy errors in this book. I don't understand why Perret didn't have Stephen Ambrose proofread this manuscript before sending it off to be published. Anyone who wants to know the real Ike will lose to Ambrose's books, not this inconsequential and vapid treatment. Perret specializes in shoddy biographies, like the ones he did on U.S. Grant and MacArthur."
1,Poorly trimmed plastic parts.,"The Suncast model JTT175B hose reel cart I received on 7-30-09 came with a great deal of untrimmed plastic from around the edges of almost every part. I use a 100 foot Craftsman 5/8 inch rubber hose, and I just barely got it on the reel winding it smartly. The gap between the sides of reel and the sides of the cart is just wide enough to allow the hose to flop over the top of the reel and get stuck between them. Often when I pull the hose from the cart the hose gets stuck in the gap forcing me to walk back to free it, often times more than once. The short supply hose that came with the hose reel cart was defective, for it had a bad spraying leak where the male brass end is crimped to the hose. I contacted Suncast by e-mail regarding the defective hose, and I have not received a responce from them in the 3 days before writing this review."
1,"For those who are new to IQ, read on","I picked up this album after reading over the reviews since it was also recommended by amazon. Obviously by my rating, I was not very impressed. I was introduced to progressive rock by Dream Theater about 15 years ago and until recently, I'm embarassed to admit, I didn't realize there was a genre called 'progressive rock'. The musicianship of IQ is good but I was hoping for something to grab me. The whole album is much more laid back and melodic than I expected. The over all tempo is - and hopefully this makes sense - trapped in between soft rock and your normal every day rock. As far as songs go, they seemed to meld into one another. In other words, no one song stood out as the leader of the pack. This cd wasn't really to my liking but if what I described fits your fancy, go for it - you'll love it.For those of you who are looking for a review and are already fans, I'm afraid I can't be much help to you in regards to comparing this album to others."
1,There was a good idea in there somewhere.,"However the script is such an amateurish mess that the film fails miserably. The performances are wonderful, especially for such a parade of B-listers but with that screenplay it is all for not.There is never a moment of truth in this entire film. It disappoints me so much I had to give it one star. It could have been so great and so important if a competent filmmaker had been involved."
1,A Lack of Class,"This has got to be the most tasteless piece of drivel ever created. It is hard to believe that 2 of the band members (Young and Shaw) were long-time members of the Original Styx group which entertained countless millions of fans during the 70s, 80s and early and mid nineties. This was a real class act when Dennis DeYoung was at the helm but I cannot find even one song on this CD that is not offensive to me."
1,broken,_I sent it back the board was fryed. they sent me another one and it was locked and could not get into it. sent it back.Been waiting on another one that was supposed to of shipped Aug 17th have not got it YET and this is the 25th. HOW MANY STARS WOULD YOU GIVE IT?
1,I don't recommend this product.,"I was not able to get this photo album to work like it was advertised. So, after getting my electronic-expert grandson to check it out without success, I returned it."
1,Don't waist you money,Hunter's Specialties Scent-A-Way Odorless Powder Does not work to keep you dry it actually made me sweat more then I would with out it. I use scent a way for everything but this is one product I will never buy again
1,ouch,"By the end of Chapter Five, the author had flogged me with the phrase 'Texas Ranger' more than thirty times, with far too many of them attached to the heroine's husband's full name, i.e.'Jack Galway, TEXAS RANGER.' (my caps.) The cast, who supposedly already knew the heroine, spoke in awkward, expositional sentences like, ""Hello, Susanna Dunning Galway, stubborn, willful, separated wife of Jack Galway, TEXAS RANGER. How is that ten million dollars you have that you haven't told your Texas Ranger husband about yet and oh, have you told him about Beau Garrity, your secret stalker of one year ago who might have murdered his wife and the reason you separated from your husband Jack Galway, Texas Ranger?"" The villains are limp spaghetti and their motivations ridiculous. Iris Dunning, the supposed grand dame is no more memorable than the Galway daughters. I kept hoping for an avalanche but I couldn't read past page 200 because I simply didn't care if they all lived or died."
1,Great Whitening Results But Not Worth the Pain!,"I had my custom trays made by my dentist & was given the 15% Opelescence. It whitened and brightened my teeth after only 4 days but my teeth ached from the sensitivity for days on end! (I have always had sensitive teeth.) I couldn't continue using the product. If you don't have sensitive teeth, this is the best whitening gel on the market but you MUST get custom trays from your dentist that fit properly. A good tip is to store the gel in the refrigerator. It keeps the gel's whitening concentration from depleting and the syringes will be good for at least a year."
1,More Weird Pricing,"Rating based on the pricing of the slim pack version, not on the show iteself.Season 3 (Slim Pack) = $53.99Season 3 (Non-slim Pack? ) = $34.99So what makes the slim pack worth an extra $19.00. There's no mention I can see of any extras. The same weird pricing existed on Season 2.Buyer Beware(Prices current as of the date of this posting)"
1,Not well made,"I ordered this US map instead of the Melissa & Doug version because I like that Mexico and Canada are visible. I hate that the M & D version makes the US look like an island. However, this is a cheap puzzle made of cardboard. The pieces are too tight and it is very difficult to put together, even if you know where all of the states are. We also ordered the Melissa & Doug World map puzzle. My son plays with that one exclusively. He doesn't touch this one."
1,Disposable airbed,That bed came with a hold. We had to use the patch from the first night. The quality is disposable.
1,Lovely Still...totally disappointing,"Just finished watching this movie and can firmly say...DON'T WATCH IT!!! It was SO DELIGHTFUL and then turned into a total downer. Great people in it, but they should have left the story as it was through the first half - a wonderful, surprising, charming love story instead of turning it into a psychological BUMMER!!"
1,The Weight Loss Cure They Don't Want You to Know About,"I would rather just get to the nuts and bolts of the program. This program could have been summed up in one or two chapters. Also, who wants to implement 50-75 new tasks including taking shots to lose weight.I feel the television previews were a little misleading."
1,Goofy,I don't know what I was thinking. Really kind of a silly device. I think you'll have better results if you just do meditation.
1,"This is the worst accounting book ever, but i HAVE to read it for class..","As the heading said, this book sucks..1) I thought first off that the size of the book was going to be cool, but NO! The book always closes when your trying to do the end of chapter problems. If you want to flip between the in chapter problems and look up something in the book its almost impossible. Or, if you want a page open to write a definition you have to have your hand holding the book down to make sure you can write it.2) The book is super confusing and very dry. Im so glad i have a cool teacher for this class that really explains what they are talking about. I will read the chapter and not know what I read at all the next day.3) They don't explain anything!I hope no one else gets stuck with this book for a Government Accounting class."
1,Needs some soul,"I was visiting friends in Germany last year and went to see TYA, enjoyed them, and bought this album from their website. I don't know how much they sound like the original TYA and not having even been around for their heyday I don't really care.When I saw them I thought the band had a lot of spontaneity. On this CD what I hear is layer upon layer of production with such an emphasis on trying to be technically excellent that they've managed to avoid having any soul. The guitarist is terrific and has a lot of promise in a Satriani style but he sounds like he is trying too hard to be perfect. Instead of just giving in to the music he is trying to control it. The songs are all good if not outstanding but none really a standout. I'm disappointed because this band seemed to have the ability to be better than this. Blues rock is a dying genre and so I'd hoped this band would give us something to help revitalize it. Instead they have put out something just ordinary."
1,no good for big legs,I have bigger legs and I was hoping that they would stretch out. I was able to get my leg in but it just didn't look right and had to go back :(
1,Not what I wanted,"I own the Collins Italian dictionary and it is great. I love the phrases at the back and the lists in the front, and the small size is convenient for travel. I was hoping for the same in the Collins Gem Greek Dictionary.I did not realize that this format uses the Greek alphabet. So, in the English-Greek section, rather than having the word spelled phoenetically, showing pronunciation, it gives the translation in greek. If you don't know the Greek alphabet, this one isn't for you."
1,Does NOT work for seventeen inch (17'') laptops,"This stand does NOT work well for 17 inch laptops. The design is great and everything about it is perfect except for the fact that it does NOT work well with 17 inch laptops. It IS possible to steady your 17'' laptop on this stand, but if you try to adjust the screen or move it around your laptop can easily fall backwards because it is hanging over the edge. I would NOT recommend this stand for a 17'' laptop."
1,Beware Sandisk and Sony,"I should have paid attention to the reviewers who gave this product a low rating. I purchased the SDMSV-1024-A10 for my Sony DSC-P8 digital camera based on Sandisk's compatibility chart on their website. It did not work right from the start. A call to Sandisk tech support reported no known issues. They directed me to call Sony. The tech rep at Sony stated that there were issues with Sandisk and Sony so the only way to find out was to follow the Sony procedure for formatting. The tech stepped me through the procedure with no luck - her response was to send it back and buy a Sony next time. The reseller for Amazon, Antonline, was unwilling to refund the purcahse so I appealed to Amazon which gave me a full refund - a class company. I wonder why they do business with such poor customer-service based companies? SO BEWARE OF USING SONY AND SANDISK TOGETHER!! - It's hit or miss - buyer beware."
1,Plant no happy,I buy book it very bad. Drawing make on 20 years old Epson pinter . pictures dark I try book grow then plants sick. Book advise bad. I buy Marijuana Horticulture Cervante. Now happy it have many picture many good word drawing good advise good plants happy.
1,Skip this product.,"We had high hopes for this phone because it had the wanted features. The caller ID, the answering machine & the auto dial did not work at all. The speaker phone, after a call of several minutes, would fade out & sometimes return. You can apologize to a friend, but this was not amusing when on a business call.We appreciate Amazon for taking care of the problem."
1,A generous two stars. Dennis Quad deserves better.,"I was very dissapointed with this movie. The hype and previews were great and got ya real interested, but the movie was slow and boring at times. Many things were left unexplained such as how do you get a dead horse in a pool without anyone knowing? And what's more, how do you get him out? And what ever happened to the sheriff at the end. Does she croak or live? She was a good character that should have been more developed. The nudity and sex scene was unnecessary to the plot. Don't waste your money."
1,Didn't do the Job,"Based on the great reviews, I purchased the product to remove hard water stains on a plate glass shower enclosure. The product was able to remove the ""roughness"" of the built-up residue but the underlying stain still remained."
1,Too loud!,Grandma got this for our daughter when she was 14 months old. She enjoys climbing onto the seat and pushing buttons/turning the steering wheel. But we have to leave the noises OFF because there is no volume control and it is very loud. The voice and songs are very annoying and somewhat difficult to understand. It also is not a good riding toy as it is too wide for my daughter (now 21 months) to effectively push her feet against the floor.
1,Boring and over rated,"This book didn't have many new additions and its rules for drug addiction and other ""evil/Vile"" rules left much to be desired. There where a few redeeming factors like a few of the special abilities for weapons but all together this book wasn't worth the money."
1,Not impressed,Not really impressed. Not comfortable on my lap. The middle area for cords is a good idea. But if uncomfortable I just don't use it.
1,Couldn't get past his machismo...,"The extra star is for the regional descriptions and sometimes interesting tales of his travels. I am a woman. I read this book and enjoyed some of the descriptions of the regions and anecdotes. But through it all comes a pungent arrogance stronger than roasted garlic.Many of his observations of the Asians he encounters are so completely ""superior"" as to seem he is speaking of animals, or a KKK member speaking of minorities in the deep south.Maybe after computers, the world will dispense with men like Mr. Terzani since we women will inseminate ourselves with genetically engineered sperm. That is all."
1,Brainless and predictable,"This was engaging enough to keep me reading the entire LENGTHY book, but that is the best I can say for it. It is a good premise, but after awhile, it is hard to care about either of the two main characters. Plus, the story gets so redundant that I kept reading, waiting for the amazing plot twists. Didn't happen."
1,Barbra's Worst,I love Barbra Streisand and I couldn't believe just how bad this movie was. I was very disappointed but would have bought it anyway to add to my collection.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS TV,"I bought this tv 2 years ago and the picture has gone out on it already. I have sound but no picture. Sceptre has told me I would probably need a new power inverter which would cost me $250.00 to have it fixed and that possibly that might not fix the problem. I see no reason for a tv that is supposed to be of this caliber to go out in only 2 years. They did respond to me quickly via email and by phone but this is totally unsatisfactory and they acted like it was normal. Do not buy this tv, it is definitely not worth the money. Buy another brand."
1,Too hard to follow,I have danced my whole life. Although I am not the quickest at picking up routines I found this impossible to follow. I practiced the first routine for days. You then have to find the actual routine by forwarding to it which is not easy to find.When she actually does the routine it is so fast it is impossible to follow. I tried for weeks and finally gave up. Many other reviews said the same thing but I thought my dance experience would make it easier for me. I was wrong. Her Mat DVD is really great.I also like Jillian Michaels dvd for cardio.
1,going in the wrong direction,"I really am beside myself on how bad this game or this version of the game is. I was always a madded person versus an NFL 2K whatever person but man do I miss those days. everything i like about this franchise is gone, everything I hate about football games is here. Why do I want to do a superstar mode? just create a different game or put it in NFL head coach and get it out of this game. Give me owners mode! Fanatsy Drafts! Create your own team! more statistics! more minicamp games! more playcalling cusomization. Why would I ever want to play as an offensive lineman? seriously? How is this a good idea. oh and by the way I only have 2 thumbs. if I need to hit 5 buttons to do some special move, thats not fun. this isn't super streetfighter. yeah this game sucks, and it truley pains me to say that."
1,julio iglesias In Concert (live),"enviarme los dos cd's de julio iglesias, mediante orden de pago al recibir el producto, por la vía de transporte más rapida que se encuentre en disposicion"
1,Eh.. Not so great.,"Like nearly everyone else, I was not impressed with this movie at all. My nearly 3 year old loves Pocahontas and will sit thru the ENTIRE movie over and over but was bored within 30 minutes of watching this. To be honest, I was over this movie from the beginning. In the first one, Pocahontas spoke normally and in this one she sounds like she is just learning English. That just annoyed me throughout the whole movie. The ending was disappointing as well."
1,seriously depressing and demeaning....,"I really thought this was going to be a great book I'd enjoy. It was so incredibly frustrating and depressing. The main character is so willing to sacrifice her happiness for this family, that abuses her and doesn't even appreciate her hard work. All they do is demand more and treat her like a slave! It makes you feel like shaking her and saying ""wake-up! why are you putting up with this?"" Reading the book, you just think - she will finally snap and stand up for herself, but she doesn't! Reading about the parents completly disfunctional relationship with each other and complete lack of relationship with their son, is really very sad.I did not find this book funny, I found it infuriating and depressing... Save your time and read something else - anything else!"
1,You get what you pay for,What more can I say. Its poor quality glass - writing off as bad investment!!
1,Rapid burnout,"While I really liked the dryer's performance and the flexibility of using it with either the concentrator or diffuser attachments it came with, I'm really disappointed that it's burned out and inoperable after using it (not even daily or at the highest setting!) for under two weeks.Like another reviewer, I've waited a few days and tried resetting the plug and any outlet that I plug it into (all the outlets work with other appliances) and this dryer is definitely dead after a very brief run. Since people are having such widely varied results, I can only wonder as to the manufacturer's quality control process, possibly letting through a few too many faulty machines..."
1,Cheap piece of crap,Doesn't work unless it's plugged into the computer. Buttons don't work. Four-way button is loose in the socket and feels like it could fall out any second. Headphone jack only plugs halfway into the port. I feel like they built this thing for around 98 cents. Completely worthless. Maybe the one they sent me is defective.
1,of little use,"The book is perhaps of historical interest and contains some adequate illustrations that may help you recoginize some genera. It is, however, fairly useless for identification to the species level."
1,Hard to read but good,"Hard to read,little dry but good information. It was hard to pick back up. But once I did I could stay with it for the information."
1,Why I hated it!!,"When I purchased the first two episodes of ""Season 5"" I assumed I was getting something new. What I got was two reruns from season 4!! Season 5 does not start until episode 3! Had I know I was paying for two episodes that I had already seen, I would not have purchased them."
1,Thanks for the warning...,"I am currently reading this book and, at page 54, was tearing my hair out.This book has been writen for morons. The tiny little paragraphs, the itallics, the exclamation marks make this a very frustrating read.I actually commented to my husband this morning - it's like a computer game that you read instead of play!Thanks for the heads up - it obviously won't get any better so I won't be investing any more of my valuable time on it."
1,DARE I SAY? !!!,"Where Have All The Cowboys Gone?If they caught Paula's self pity filledSwearing and Primal Howling,""They headed for The Hills""."
1,Oregon Scientifc Customer Service sucks,"Wrote to them several times, without receiving a response. Called and got rude responses. Will never buy from this company again!"
1,"An excellent ""Disposable"" lawn mower","At first we thought it was a great lawn mower. (but instantly we knew we should have gone cordless, because of cord issues.) We've used it 12 times maybe? and the motor has burnt out! REALLY???! We're *very* angry and dissappointed. That's $250 of hard earned cash (we don't have much of these days) gone! One of the worst investments we've ever made.Make sure you clean the bag (if used) and underneath after each use. (That's still not a guarrantee it will prolong it's life) It certainly didn't with the lemon we got. We'll never invest in a Worx product again. Buyer beware, it will work great the first 6 or so times, after that be prepared to buy another."
1,"I love it, but it causes problems...","I love the sleeve because it's thin, feels great, is very easy to slide on and off, protects the whole iPod yet you can easily see the screen and use the touch-wheel.BUT... I've had a lot of problems w/ my iPod ever since I bought this sleeve, and when I remove the sleeve the problem goes away. Sound weird? Maybe, maybe not. The reason you can slide your finger along the outside of the sleeve and still have the touch-wheel pick up your movements is STATIC. I think that this static is causing the iPod to malfunction.I've gotten ""sad ipod"" icons, I've had it freeze up, I've had it go as far as selecting ""Play"" on a file but not play, all kinsa of malfunctions. However, remove this sleeve and the iPod returns to normal function.It's ashame, because the sleeve itself is awesome.I have not done a scientific test on the sleeve, this is just my observation/my experience."
1,Eagle- eye cherry stinks!!!,"I HATE them! the lyrics are stupid, the singer has a gross voice, the tunes are crappy and the video! OMIGOD, it was so stupid i could puke! I would have rated this CD -1 million stars if i could. it. is. totally. STUPID!"
1,didn't receive the correct charger,"Although the charger was a very good price, it did not fit the DS. The description showed it would work on the Nintendo DS. It cost too much in postage to return, so just kept it but have no use for it."
1,Not as Described,"The description & pictures show clear pages with a pocket, sized for comic books. What I received were 8x10 photo pages that are way too big for comic books! There is nothing printed on this box that states these are the comic book pages, only for 8x10 photos, so I don't know how you can mistaken them!"
1,A disappointment,"I found this game to be boring and the graphics were not the best. If you like little green men, go for it."
1,Worst Solo Release,"Anyone who tries to say it is not his worst solo CD is fooling themselves. There are a few ok tracks, but for the most part Encore Blows. By the way, Mosh is NOT one of the good tracks, it's a rehash from the 8 mile disc and just because it agrees with your political beliefs doesn't make it a good track. (And doesn't change the fact that the pres was re-elected) Stick with the Slim Shady album and Marshall M album, don't waste your $$ here. Will I buy the next album? Likely, but I'll wait until I hear about it first before running out to buy it the first day."
1,It mainly about Security Risk issues,"As an example, in the chapter on IT Risks and Controls, the only discussion of data integrity is buried in a few lines in a section entitled Security Risk. The examples in the book are mainly about Security issues. Take the subject of data integrity on file transfers. I believe the only mention of the subject outside of Security concerns is a Figure on the OSI Model (Transport layer alone won't detect if a mixture of old and new files are erroneously transfered to downstreams). There is no mention of detection/recovery of skipping/double-posting transactions, error thresholds, data base consistency on no-posts, restart/retry logic, checking for count and amount mismatches, balancing using checkpoints, etc. An auditor I believe should be aware of these types of issues concerning data integrity even in a core concept book."
1,"Not as nice looking as the duvet, doesn't reach floor","I liked the duvet cover but can't say the same about the bedskirt. The denim is perhaps a little too distressed. More importantly, the bedskirt doesn't reach the carpet, so it just hangs in the air looking forlorn. It's disappointing since the bed I have it on is about average height."
1,"If this was a movie, I would have demanded my money back!","I cannot see how so many people have gotten hooked on this guy's writing. It is obviously geared to juvenile tastes (and I have no problem with that), but he is being sold as a 'serious' writer. Predictable plot, predictable characters, predictable outcome. Boring!"
1,As drab and dreary a read as the landscape it describes,"This is one of the worst books I have read in a long time. Its landscape is bleak, its characters are bleaker, and its plot non-existant. A chore to read, a relief to put down."
1,"Huge fan of The Smashing Pumpkins,but not of this CD.","My very first impression of this disc was that it was awful.I don't know anything about Gothic music,so I figured I would stay with a band's music I already know.Rhinoceros,God and Bullet with Butterfly Wings aren't that great.In fact I would say they're quite bad,but The End Is The Beginning Is The End,Ava Adore and others are good.The reason I didn't like some of the songs is because they sound really spacey and over done.Plus Some of the vocals sound like a cross between Billy Idol and Elvis with a demonic flair.Some of this was almost too funny to listen to.But if you're a huge Pumpkins fan and must have everything even remotely related to them buy it,if not I suggest you don't bother."
1,Beloved is a disappointment,This is truly the worst movie I have ever seen. It was the longest 2 and a half hours of my life!!! I reccomend cleaning out your sock drawer instead of watching this movie. It will be a more enjoyable experience.
1,I didn't like this product at all,The material is polyester but it is the stiffest polyester ever made. You can't really tie this scarf appropriately because it is so stiff and awkward that doesn't sit well. It's basically useless and doesn't look good at all. I would certainly not recommend this product.
1,disapointing!,"How this movie got as high a rating as it did is beyond me. I bought it for the ratings but was sadly disappointed. No plot, poor acting, little nudity and only in lead actress (and actor) no others. Even the body of the lead actress left something to be desired (extremely thin with not much muscle tone except legs, and a long torso) For you females, the lead actor had a nice body but he carried himself like a stiff robot and, as I said, the acting was very forced and contrived. What plot there was was really unrealistic with the rapid progress to the sex stage unatural and pretty unbelievable.Don't buy this movie if you're a thinking person."
1,Not happy!,"These are NOT worth the money. The dogs had them off VERY quickly, and even after tightening, they tore the front seam off within 10 minutes, making them pointless.It took a LONG time to get the package in, and when it finally arrived, the envelope was so small that the contents were spilling out and the flap was opened."
1,THE INN KEEPERS ( SLEEP AID ),"One must wait for this movie to be either a gift , or maybe pay a dollar . The only thing it did for me was to put me to sleep . Maybe Sominex sleeping pills can add this film to their product ; IF YOU BUY THE ECONOMY SIZE , YOU GET THIS FREE MOVIE ! I can see it at wallgreens pharmacy section now ."
1,It takes years of practice to write this bad....,"I love Michael Crichton books. I mean, who doesn't right? This book is not up to par at all compared to his other works. I felt like this book had an excellent premise and could have gone the distance. The beginning was very good and I thought it had promise. All of a sudden, when you get about half way through chapter two, you come to realize your error. This book is just cheesy. If I wanted to watch b flicks on the Syfy channel I would be doing that instead of reading a book. It is hard to believe this is out of the same mind that brought us such books as Jurassic Park and Congo. I might have to start reading the book previews before buying if this becomes a pattern. UGH."
1,great if you are 14,"Yeah if you are between 14-16 you should love this crap cause thats what exactly it is. They call themselves Nashville Pussy but they really should call themselves White Trash cause they are not much more then that. There is nothing complex here its just the way you would expect something when you were, well 14. Loud, no real meaning,and they are not really all that fun either so i dont get it, it looks like because they mention Sex that means they are good? Wrong, they suck bigtime and there is no talent here and they are not saying anything here that hasn't been already said many many times, save your money"
1,Possibly good speakers...if they don't fall apart,"My first warning should have been the branding: the word ""COBY"" stamped on these speakers is clearly meant to be mistaken for ""SONY"". Hilarious. Anyway, I have no opinion of the sound quality of the speakers because the cable broke while trying to remove a piece of packaging tape from it. Just pulled apart -- the wire and the plastic insulation, everything. I tried for a minute or so to splice it back together, but to no avail, and it occurred to me that the time I would spend fixing these speakers would be worth more than the $8 I paid for them.One piece of advice if you buy these speakers: please recycle them when you realize they're garbage. They should never have been made, but they certainly don't belong in a landfill."
1,A waste of time,"If you are a true procrastinator, don't waste your time by reading this book. While the author has good suggestions for those who have trouble making decisions, she fails miserably at helping those who know what to do and simply can't take action. If suggestions such as ""start sooner"" is what you're looking for, then this is the book for you. If you'd be motivated by calling yourself a ""smart little snuffle-bunny,"" as the author suggests, then this is the book for you! However, if you are over the age of 10 and don't appreciate being patronized, I would not suggest wasting your time and money. After I read the book, I was so distraught that I had wasted 10 hours of my time that I could never get back. If you are struggling with procrastination, you'd be better off with another book choice."
1,NOT 12 in an order! ONLY one!,"Looking through past reviews, I see that this is an ongoing problem since JANUARY. Well it is now September and it has not been corrected.You do not receive a dozen paint pens, you only receive one. I called customer service and was told I'll be refunded the full amount charged, in the next 1-2 business days. The price quoted online wasn't the price charged, then the customer rep. quoted a completely different amount then either of those, very sketchy! I am VERY skeptical, I'll have to wait and see. Will never shop through Shoplet again!"
1,mixed too fast,The original album is at the correct speed. Somehow thiswas remastered at a faster tempo and it makes some of thesongs sound soooooo wrong. Wish they would remaster thisgem. Go find the lp.
1,Disappointed,"Disappointed, January 16, 2007Reviewer: Critiquer - See all my reviewsI was expecting this to be of the same quality as the Floral Rose that I ordered from the same company, but it wasn't. The pillow cases were smaller than the full-sized sheet set with the floral rose pattern. In all fairness, I will have to say that I am perfectly satisfied with the floral rose set, and find it very comfortable. I don't know why there is such a difference.Incidentally, having had such a positive experience with the Floral Rose sheet set, I ordered 2 blue twin sets , and was not saitisfied with these... I would recommend the Floral Rose sheet set, but not this."
1,even pressing fast forward and watching was...,...almost as bad as watching with regular speed. although you didn't have to hera the stupid dialogue.don't watched or even buy it.
1,Nice Frame - Hard to Stand Up,These frames are nice to look at but the frame stand that holds the picture up stretches so far to the back of the frame that it takes a lot of room in depth to stand up. The frames are very nice to look at but the backs are not convenient and take up too much space.
1,Horrible,"My son absolutely loves The Wiggles and this video he wont even watch for a couple of minutes. Where is the fun from Murray, Greg, Anthony and Jeff??"
1,Poorly written propaganda,"I just picked this up in a library book sale and I must say that I wish I had my $0.15 back. It looks like there's at least one fallacy or falsehood on every page. Johnson briefly addresses some fallacies he thinks he's encountered in dealing with scientists, but somehow he fails to see that the very same fallacies permeate his writing. I've seen more coherent and eloquent arguments for creationism on free websites. I'm no longer a creationist and I'm convinced that creationism in our times is essentially a conjecture based on ignorance and faulty reasoning. But even if I was still a creationist, I think I would be disappointed by the dumbed-down approach of the book."
1,Intex: Filling America's Landfills One Airbed at a Time,"I purchased this product because I was tired of poorly made airbeds that fail to hold air after a few uses. This airbed had better than average reviews so I bought one. It worked well perhaps 3-4 times over a 3 month period. After that it would deflate within 4-5 hours. I had been very careful about in how I used and stored it and nevertheless, it still failed. This poorly made Intex airbed is now taking up space in a landfill somewhere.This airbed finally convinced me to spend the money and buy a durable, self-inflating, 3 inch thick Thermarest sleeping pad. Thermarest sleeping pads are not cheap, but they seem to be worth the money."
1,"So simple. Sometimes naive. Worst of all, suspected............","As an underdog and a loser in life, I find the book not helpful at all. The writing skill is bad and examples are few. However, that still didnt make my rating a one star, if not for the fact, with my very negative opinion of it, that I had been curious enough to check the mix of the ten five star ratings from the previous eleven reviews, and not so surprised to find three readers anonymous plus seven one shot only reviewers. Pardon me if I got it all wrong, but I do despise such manipulation on Amazon."
1,10 months later...,loved this blender for the 10 months i had it ... then the cheap plastic bottom cracked and everything leaked out all over table. Now it's worthless because you can't replace teh canister. If you're looking for a blender that will last the whole year then this one is not for you.
1,Missing and Reprinted,This book was a sad excuse. The cover was in great condition. There were chapters missing and reprinted in the wrong place in this book. It was upsetting not being able to know how the book ended.
1,Not what I expected based on other reivews...........,"****See my review for Master of the Night, also by Angela Knight.Interchange the names of the books and a few facts, and pretty much the review of this book is the same. I honestly couldn't find anything to like about this book, except maybe the talking wolf. Baran, a warrior from 300 years in the future, was pulled off a major mission and inexplicably sent to the past to save Jane from Jack the Ripper/Druas - yet we find out that she was supposed to really die, and not actually be saved at all??? So why would the TE bother sending Baran at all? What's up with that?If you want any sort of intelligent erotica, you will not find it with this book."
1,Boring,"The story was ok, but it was boring because they did not get into the nitty griity until the last chapter . hot scenes were not there just a lot of beating around the bush . would not recommend . not Nan Ryan's usual style. Please write some new books ."
1,look good at first,dented and sold as new.I didnt notice that dent on the left side of the product until recently.
1,report abuse in the purchase of this watch,"Hi, I would like to report an abuse on the purchase of this watch by the seller, since I bought this watch on black Friday for a Christmas gift, and I live in Venezuela where we have only 400 dollars a year for online shopping restriction for a national program, then this seller irresponsibility of not updating the online store amazon, sold this item in your physical store and I cancel the order, then to cancel the purchase did not care that my dollar was blocked and lost my $ 74.95 because the bank not to me can be returned because the bar program national de restriction of dollars does not allow me to receive more than $ 400, now I need the seller to be responsible for this purchase to be canceled for irresponsible not to keep their products Amazon, this is an irresponsible seller did not understand the responsibilities they should have with all customers visiting this shop for this reason require the seller or amazon take responsibility for my $ 74.95."
1,What a stupid movie,"I would have hunted the guy to the death too. And wtf is with the ending?!?!? At least take your gun and knife because you'll need them. Also how is Liem Neson walking so well, HE IS SHOT!!!! Don""t waist you time."
1,An insultingly simplistic homily about change in life,"""Who Moved My Cheese"" makes its point - that we tend to be paralyzed with fear without justification over change - in its first two pages, then beats us unmercifully with it for another ninety-six. The gift of this book from a superior or coworker is tantamount to receiving a bottle of Scope anonymously. Save the 45 minutes you would spend reading this, update your resume, and get a new job. You got the same lesson, and didn't feel as if you'd just read ""Winnie The Pooh Loses His Honey"", which would no doubt be just as useful and not quite as insulting."
1,It's OK o sleep through the first five discs,"This second season of ""Fringe"" experiences a big drop-off in the quality of story-telling. Most of the episodes are stand-alone stories of freaky, far-fetched cases that land on the Fringe unit's lap. A few episodes give us some back story for a few of the characters. Very little of this is entertaining, and by the time the series returns to the ""our world vs. our world's parallel universe"" narrative, you will be wondering whether to invest your free time elsewhere. I plowed through, but I don't know if it was worthwhile. That's simply a reflection on how bad most of these episodes are. The last couple episodes, it has to be said, are pretty damn good."
1,Pathetic,"If you like the taste of talcum powder in water, go for it.It tastes incredibly chalky and has an overwhelming chemical taste."
1,Not for long projects,"The most unstable program I use. Works nicely when it doesn't crash. Seems to work fairly well with short projects (say, less than 1/2 hour) then starts falling apart with longer ones."
1,NO good,Please don't be fooled there is a big difference between the songs you listen to in the movie and the one's that are on the CD
1,A Travesty of the Original,"I bought this because I lost my original (and I mean ORIGINAL) in a fire. This, on the other hand, represents false advertising. It is billed as the ""Original Motion Picture Score"" but it is not. It's not even close. They've taken the most beautiful movie soundtrack ever recorded and destroyed it. It's difficult to listen to - it's noisy, all nuance is removed from it. This is the soundtrack as if played by some high school band. Do not buy it. Buy the original. I will. This was a mistake. There should be a disclaimer on the cover such as ""based on the original motion picture score."""
1,I own one,"It works well BUT Dell is the pits... they no longer carry this model and it costs more to repair then replace. The next model up has different cartridges so if you have any left when this model goes, tough luck as they can only take a specific kind of cartridge. the quality is good, but unless you like talking to foreigners that speak broken english, you don't get very far with tech support."
1,"Not user friendly, there are better choices","I bought this player at Costco under the CV-37 model number. It immediately aggravated me with an extremely poor user interface. The remote is difficult to use, and there are virtually no buttons on the unit. It takes 5 seconds for the unit to ""boot up"" to where it will take a command (like ""disc skip"" or ""open tray""). I was also amazed at how difficult it was to play a CD on random play. It requires an arcane sequence of button pushes on the remote that you will surely forget between uses (and I am an electrical engineer).I just took mine back to Costco and am now shopping for a new player that handles CD's better since this is how I use it 80% of the time. Oh, I almost forgot. The last straw was I rented a movie with some minor scratches and it wouldn't play it! I take the movie back to the store, they put it into their machine, and it played fine!"
1,not worth the investment,"I just wanted to add my review to the others who have posted about the problems with this device. I enjoyed using my blender for green smoothies-- easily pulverized stringy leafy greens, frozen fruit, ice, even lemon seeds. After a few months the plastic fittings that house the blade have loosened and the liquid leaks all over the blender and the counter. Tightening up the housing does not solve the problem for even one use. I decided to leave a review after having looked up a price for a replacement-- $50 for a new jar! Are you kidding me? Check out the amazon reviews, people are MAD and so they should be! Spend your blender money on a different brand!"
1,Not Good Enough,"Amy lost much of her Xtian fan base when she defected from Gary Chapman to Vince Gill. This album is not going to help her regain what she lost, because it sounds too much like Mr.Gill. Granted, he is a pretty good instrumentalist and a tolerable singer, but not a good producer; not even the great Brown Bannister could rescue this album from the Gill influence. Coupled with the dismal sales of her previous 2 albums, this one does not bode well for Amy's musical future."
1,This is junk,"Don't buy this product. Not only will it drain your player, but may also potentially fry it. I received this item and plugged my player into it with roughly half of the battery left. Not only did it not charge, but it drained the player to the point where it won't even turn on. I have tried to charge the player through my computer with the original USB cable and now it won't even show a charge. Total waste of money and complete junk."
1,Not recommended,"The one value I found in this book was the collection of parallel sayings of Jesus and Buddha. But there are good and better collections elsewhere. Other than that I am sorry I cannot recommend the book. The author's understanding of Christian theology, especially of the Christian East, is seriously lacking. His intention is good, but his execution is simply sub-par."
1,"Great idea, but...","The idea - to promote awareness of the Negro League and what the players went through prior to baseball's integration - was a wonderful one. However, the writing and the acting make the story seem far less than real. The characters do not behave in any way as their real life counterparts would. While kids ages 7 - 12 will likely enjoy this after-school-special type of movie, adults will likely find it difficult to watch."
1,The Adventures of Mark twain,"I couldn't play the DVD on my DVD player/recorder and couldn't figure out why. I finally read the jacket and it said that it would play only on a DVD player, and would not work on a DVD player /recorder. Who ever heard of such of crazy thing. Needless to say, its useless and will have to go back...."
1,WAS THIS SUPPOSED TO BE EDGY?,"from what i recall while fading in and out of sleep,1 kid for some reason or another cant escape the clutches of this older kid.so he and some other kids plot to kill him.um,is it just me or was there no other alternative?this is supposed to be based on real life events and that may be as sad as this movie version.it seems that after the killing,the kids cant wait to confess their''SECRET''to whoever is willing to listen.this isnt edgy in the least...not 1 charactor is believable/sympathy worthy.im not ragging on this because kids was such an incredible movie..."
1,hard for Mom to tolerate,"I love folk music, but this CD contains only 2 songs that I like and only 2 others that I can even tolerate. My kids seem to like it (the ones I don't hit the skip button for) but I am not going to sacrifice myself when there are plenty of other recordings that they and I both like.Why don't I like it? Zanes has a croak similar to Bob Dylan's; with all due respect to Dylan's great songwriting, I don't enjoy his singing. Zane's friends vary in talent but none of them seem able to harmonize together. The songs in a minor key are particularly grating, such as ""All Around the Kitchen"" which many people seem to like, though I can't see why. The instrumentation is nothing special either. Don't buy this just because you like the song ""Jump Up"" from Sesame Street; you should listen before you buy to make sure the rest of it matches your taste."
1,The Iron Lady,"The content of the movie was very well done. The quality of the ""feed"" was less than acceptable. There were breaks in the video and audio. We became so annoyed at the broken up scenes, we went out and rented the movie from another provider. I'm assuming this was just a fluke. We will still rent from you again."
1,Two thumbs Up,"The book, With or Without You-A Spiritual Journey Through Love and Divorce, by Cameron Conant, is one of the best books I have read on the subject of divorce. As a professional dealing with divorcing couples, I find that this book has a positive message for those going through the heartache of divorce. I have recommended this book to many people who have been able to relate to the emotions which Cameron so aptly expresses. The book ends on a note of hope for the future as the author shares what he has learned from this painful experience."
1,Horrible,"Screen cracked in the first month, battery dies quickly and once I have cleared out my messages the phone continues to page me as if I still had a voice message. You are better off with two tin cans with a string tied between them."
1,Good Product-when it lasted.,"This was a pretty good product until the damn thing just stopped working and just froze up when you tried to turn it on. I had it just over a year and after turning it on the device just went into bootup mode, never actually coming on. As long as I had it, it would frequently exhibit the same behavior. The only thing that would help was to take out the battery out and back in. Finally in the end, that did not help at all.The durability of the Sansa's line is poor at best."
1,Fun to watch if you have nothing better to do,"If you are a fan of the show, then this might be fun for you to watch. Especially if you missed some episodes like I did. You get to hear all the foul language, and for the women that felt the need to show their silicone enhanced boobs, you get to see some nipple that would make CBS cringe. LOL It's fun to watch if you have nothing better to do."
1,Totally Disappointed,"When I ordered this book, I thought I was going to find a lot of really great ways to entertain my almost two year old. By page 117, I had found maybe 2 ideas that were new and moderately interesting. Most of the ideas are repetitive or ridiculous, if not so simple you have already thought of them on your own. This was a waste if time and money and I would not recommend it to anyone. You will have much better luck spending a little time doing an internet search."
1,Not As Advertised,"Con: The book provided was not like new and free of highlighting as advertised; rather, the book is dingy, most of the pages were stuck together from a coffee spill (I'm hoping it is coffee), and pages are highlighted. I've separated all of the pages but I do wonder sometimes what I am touching. The highlighting is less of an issue because I highlight textbooks.Pro: The seller is polite but refutes my observations. After a couple of emails the seller offered to discount the book or accept a return. I appreciate the gesture but I need the book for school. The offer of a discount is kind but not worth the complications of changing the original order.Lesson: Rather than try to change anything, I'll accept the lesson learned and make future purchases with this experience in mind."
1,Well...,If they couldn't get the core functions of the game to work then what makes you believe that this is going to work any better?
1,power cruising:,"This useful basic introduction to the subject was spoiled for me by the lack of intelligent editing. Most importantly, the text becomes highly irritating with the frequent re-iteration of cute phrases such as ""first-rate first mate"" (for his wife); ""very able research assistant"" (for two or people who had so served) and ""swinging on the hook"" (for at anchor). Beyond that, the author's detailed memory for meals eaten aboard serves only to annoy. The addition of this and other, similiarly fluffy material makes one wonder if the intention is to meet a assigned page target. The fault may well lie with the editor, who should have chopped out the redundencies and enough fluff to permit more practical details, particularly regarding ""down in the bilge"", which tends to get short shrift. In sum, a book for beginners with money to spend which needs editing."
1,For REAL dummies,"I expected much more from this book. It really explains you the most logic things which could be simply red on the menus. It do not help you with tips and tricks about how to organize your accounts (for example, cash, bank and visa, how shall they relate to each other?).Only the investment section is quite comprehensive and there are some tips for choosing one service or another.Moreover it does not cover every aspect of Quicken, but probably there is another more compete manual out there…I've used Quicken for a couple of years and if you have the same experience, I do not recommend this product."
1,What a disappointment!,"After reading all the 5 star reviews of this book, I ordered the book. I was dismayed at the waste of pages containing the authors personal photos with little or no exposure information given. Peterson goes into a very mild discussion of exposure in the first few pages. The balance of the book is about other aspects of photography. Very little is actually devoted to exposure technique. He barely mentions exposure meters and assumes everyone has a 35mm camera with a built in meter. HA!! Avoid this book."
1,Vegetable Steamer,I have boughten two of these veggie steamers just for the fact that it's very hard to find other varieties of steamers. I rated this one very low on the fact that even though it works well - when you go to clean it you have to dry it immediately or it will rust. It says it's dishwasher safe and I guess if you don't mind rust with your veggies it is.
1,"It does not--it could not--get any worse: Do Not Walk, Run","I have no idea what I was thinking when I bought this. This truly is the worst thing I've ever seen--or heard. What this does to the beauty and depth of Cummings' lyric poetry is beyond words, unimaginable, really. Where does one even begin? If producing something bad in its own right--let alone what destructiveness it does to its subject--were a criminal offense, this would be a capital crime of the highest order. Run."
1,broken on arrival,"the light never did light up on this product even right out of the box, and the value was low enough that I did not bother to return it."
1,Screwed up,"Another reviewer mentioned that the characters and story drew her in, but that the ending of the story was just too difficult. I feel just the opposite. The tragic events near the end of the book finally gave an otherwise dull story some color. The screwed up characters were not particularly interesting and I had a very hard time getting engaged in their random and self-destructive behavior. Of the last 20 or 30 novels that I have read, this one I almost abandoned midstream. I acknowledge that there were moments of sensitivity and clever insight in this book, but these redeeming nuggets were floating in a sea of boredom."
1,I should have read the other reviews,"I didn't think that artists like the Smith's would lip-synch their songs on an English TV show. This was a terrible DVD and I'm a big fan of The Smiths. I was expecting something like ""The Complete Jam"" DVD, which is an incredible slice of music history. Don't buy this unless you have to own every speck of media generated by (for) The Smiths."
1,Little substance,"Lots of words, little substance. Not too different from the ""scientific atheism"" of the former USSR."
1,Poor video quality.,"The video quality was so poor I couldn't stand to watch it. Way out of focus. The film wasn't compelling enough for me to want to get past the poor quality, so I can't really review the film in a fair way."
1,Don't buy this product,"I would NOT recommend this product. I had the base for about 5 years. The tone on the keypad never worked right. I got a second telephone line so I ordered an additional handset. It worked for about 2 weeks.I registed the handset with the base ok. I then decided to swith the phone to the other telephone line. The base handset worked ok, but now the additional one I just bought 2 weeks ago does nothing. It just sits there saying ""Connecting ..."". I de registered the original handset ok and re registered it, but nothing on the new handset.I tried everything. I even brought into the AT&T; store which said there is nothing they could or would do. I called the 800 number [...] and there response is that they no longer support this phone.If you don't support it why do you still SELL it. Shame on you AT&T.; this is my last phone from you.Shame on you Amazon for even selling it. I hope you take it off your website"
1,Brittle plastic,"Shipped in a BIG GIANT box which made me laugh, so it has that going for it. Happily swatted flies for a few weeks before it snapped near the base of the plastic swatter. I sort of glued it back together and it is working again but the brittleness of the plastic leads me to believe that these are very old, from a stock of swatters molded in the 80s or something."
1,An unlovable bunch,This is certainly no Lonesome Dove. McMurtry is one of my favorite authors but this book was a disappointment. While the characters are interesting and diverse they all share one common trait: they are all extremely unlovable. I like to have at least one character that I can care about in some way. So far there are none in this story. Perhaps he is waiting for the next three books to bring out someone's good qualities.
1,Contaminated product,"I enjoy a variety of ON Whey products. In plastic jugs, they have a great taste. However, these variety packs have a bad metallic taste to them. I would recommend getting the 2lb. jugs instead to try a flavor, as the sampler is not representative of the product."
1,eats batteries,I am very unhappy with this monitor. I can't turn the receiver on very easily and it has an annoying beep when the signal is lost. The receiver also looses the signal very easily.
1,He should be [silent]!,This CD desecrates some wonderful classics. He should stick to what he knows. This is not it - go back to rock and roll.
1,I would give it 0 stars if I could,"I don't understand this wine sealer at all. I've tried and tried to get it to do anything but it just sits on top of the bottle with NO seal at all. What a waste of money. It would likely cost me more to return it then I paid, so I will just keep it. Worthless!"
1,beware,"dont waste your money. problems from the beginning- communication problem with monitor (2 different monitors). on the 2nd day of ownership- would not boot up. called hp- they sent me recovery discs. computer would not recover. called hp-sent box for repair. computer came back- replaced hard drive. still did not function correctly - periodic no communication with monitor.plus noticed a dent in the media card reader. calling hp (as i type with one hand-on hold waiting for supervisor for 90 minutes). requesting money back. up to now hp support was pretty good-no long holds, but this is terrible. save yourself the hassle."
1,Don't waste your time or money,"I agree with others on here,, this is not well produced,,, photo's are black blobs, and lacking information thats needed.."
1,Not her best work,"I'm a fan of Ms. Perrin but this was not one of my favorites. The story line was nice but the main character, Jade was too immature. I expected more but ended up disappointed. Not a horrible read but a little over priced for what the book contained."
1,It is something that does not do anything,One can soak clothes overnight and get a better wash than what this machine does to your clothes. It is a total waste of money and what you expect from a washer. Don't anyone buy it.
1,Perfect for your worst enemy,"This was definitely not designed by a woman. I have never experienced this much pain, I have 3 kids and tattoos all over, but the pain this caused is wayyyy worse. Just imagine 40 pairs of tweezers pulling the hair from your bikini zone all at once. OUCH!!!"
1,Not impressed with service,"Product looks like it might work, but was shipped without all the parts and three months later at the end of Summer, I am still waiting on MTD to send me the correct parts.I may update this review if I ever get the chance to use it."
1,disappointing book :(,After reading Reminiscences of a Stock Operator I was eager to learn more about Jesse Livermore's life. This book was a big disappointment. Don't be fooled by the relatively positive reviews. This book is poorly written. The factual information of Livermore's life was interesting but you'll have to wade through a lot to get at it. The recreated conversations and artistic details are particularly annoying.I highly recommend Reminiscences of a Stock Operator. That one was hard to put down. Skip this book unless you must absolutely must know a few obscure details of Livermore's life and don't mind fluffy embellishment.
1,Just Terrible,"This product, as stated in the title, is terrible. I had never used a sewing machine before so I figured a child's one would work even for a beginner. Terrible idea. The stitching has always ended up too loose and comes apart altogether. I would not recommend this to anyone; it is a waste of money."
1,Lip-synch,"Sorry, but no.The scenary is grandiose, but I want to listen to ""live"" opera. Why were they wearing microphones? Would you believe they were really singing? C'mon? The editing is a disaster. There are no subtitles (as said previously). Nevertheless I must admit that the director has balls to allow this DVD to be released."
1,Doesnt work,I ordered this bc Im irregular and thought it would be an inexpensive alternative to buying OPK. It doesnt work. Not only that the light broke about 3 weeks after owning it.When I asked my dr if it was a good tool to help he said yes and no. Maybe it doesnt work for everyone but like I said it broke regardless anyway.Take my advice and dont waste your money...
1,"Great Concept for book, but examples are incomplete","I think this was a great concept for a book, but was quickly frustrated the incomplete examples in the book. The way the databases are set up, when you get to certain portions of the book, it tells you to be working with certain data that doesn't exist and doesn't tell you how to get it in there.I returned this book about 3/4 the way through. I don't have time to correct mistakes while I learn."
1,MZ-NE410: not much product,"Received for Christmas, Software does not work with Win 98 FE and Sony does not appear to have any other software options. The Sony forum has lots of dissatisfied customers, kind of a junky little thing and does not seem to sturdy. Music appears to have to have (c) encoding so not sure if it will work for non-major lable or non-encoded mp3's or from non-pay-for mp3 sites. Seems to allow you to burn your own cd's to mp3 but so does a cheap cd-r. Plays MD's recorded from a real md player fine although the headphone signal is weak when plugged into another stereo's aux channel."
1,It doesn't work.,"I read the instructions, but after turning and turning the part that is supposed to expand into the bottle neck doesn't. Maybe mine is just a dud."
1,Boring story!,Same old Diane Keaton's acting. Boring story. If you are dog lovers you may like this one otherwise skip it and don't waist your time.
1,What was that about?,"I believe this movie must have been made at a time when sex was a new open topic, because it seems that the ONLY purpose this movie had whatsoever was to test how many times they could say the word ""sex"" in a movie during the sixties. It is not funny, sweet, sexy, dramatic or romantic. It is a nothing movie, nothing. Save yourself some money and just say the word ""sex"" out loud about 3 hundred times and call it watching the movie."
1,useless dvd,"No idea if the music is good or not, as moviemars sent a dud dvd NOT playable in region 1"
1,Doesn't stay on!,"I purchased the Stant 10509 locking fuel cap for my 2006 Toyota Tacoma in order to thwart gas thieves. However, I found out that the cap will come loose and can be removed with just a little bit of jiggling, even after turning it clockwise several clicks to tighten and lock it. The loose-fitting cap caused my check engine light to come on. I had to reinstall the factory (non-locking)gas cap to get the light to go out. I am still unable to get the cap to stay on the fuel inlet pipe, and I have not tried driving with the Stant cap again. I wish I could get a refund, but I think I waited too long."
1,Missing,Still have not received this book. I have no clue where it is??? I have been checking on it for over a month now and stiill have not received it.
1,A bit unwieldy,"Ignoring the fact that I've had it a year and only made it to page 100...the format of the book is a bit odd. It's quite a large book, and the organization of the text on the page is very overwhelming. It's like a big, poorly published textbook. Perhaps this is what Joyce wanted..."
1,For serving? Yes. For actual cooking? No.,"I've wrecked each and every piece of this Corningware by one of two things. Either I stacked them in such a way that they bumped against each other, or I scrubbed them with ""scratch safe"" sponges, and in each instance I got the same result: permanent streaky black marks in the white ceramic finish. So please learn from my pricey mistake. Go straight to the Pyrex or Marinex instead."
1,Poor Quality,"I bought 2 of this. One turned into a yucky purple/blue color after only two uses, the other broke in less than 6 months. I don't recommend it to anyone."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS STROLLER!,"This stroller is a fine purchase if you are never going to travel anywhere with it. If you plan on leaving your home, don't buy it. It is BIG, BULKY and HEAVY... I have to use all of my strength to lift it into the car! Since getting this (which I did more because of the beautiful pattern/color than for practical reasons) I have bought two more strollers. The first was the Snap N' Go (LOVED IT) for when my daughter was in her carrier, and now that she has outgrown the carrier I have gotten a lightweight stroller that is practical for getting in and out of the car. I wish I had known before I got this stroller that it would be so impractical. I now leave it in my garage and only use it for walks around home."
1,Useless support,"The bra came and although lovely it is useless for support. Also runs very small, as it is I am typically a B cup but in Elle Macpherson I am a D cup! Who manages bra sizes anyway?"
1,Weak stuff,"Here are five old half hour television shows that are important only to those interested in the subsequent histories of the participants. The material is very weak. And the bits with women, namely one Aimi Macdonald, are so bad they are embarrassing. It's great to see Marty Feldman, and he does more than his share to keep things afloat. Mostly these programs point to the genius that soon inspired the Monty Python series and, later, several humorous films."
1,Package was damaged.,"When I received the package it was damaged, however the movie does work. But the package was all wet and the stuff penguin was ruined, the dvd case was broken. Not real happy with the product but didn't complain since the movie worked. I would be very cautious ordering again."
1,It's not another Orbital.,"Being a big Orbital fan, I curently purchased Back to Mine just so i could be closer to completing my Orbital collection. In hopes of having another great techno cd I ended up with something that really sounds like an oldies album. I was so dissapointed that i couldn't even listen through the entire cd, none of the tracks are anything like the rest of the Orbital music."
1,Terrible return policy!,"No return policy. When received the book, realized the book was not required for the class, so tried to return the book the same day it arrived and the seller did not accept. Very unfortunate!"
1,Lots of dime store psychobabble,"I had to recheck this man's biography. After reading this book, I found it hard to believe he went to med school...let alone a reputable one. I feel that he was really reaching on a lot of his opinions. Not necessarily the ones about Scott but more so about Laci. For instance: He says that she was abandoned by her dad and that perhaps Laci does whatever to keep her marriage to Scott intact to avoid losing him. In For Laci, by Sharon Rocha, she says that she was the one who ended the marriage and left her husband. I think that Sharon Rocha's book is the best. Honestly, Dr. Ablow, when you use Star magazine's recommendation of you for your book cover, you lose credibility."
1,ltttle wiener!,"I cannot stand this schuck dick! He is rich and famous and has abosloutey NO TALENT what-so-ever! There are millions of musicians with more talent and they have didly squat! He gets off on being ""a pretty boy"" and nothing more. He doesnt write his music, and when he does its sucks even more! Save yourself and listen to some real music:The RamonesBeastie BoysAC/DC(old) MetallicaEddie van halenSantanaGreen DayOperation IVRichard Cheese (so funny!)Queens Of the Stone AgeJimmy Eats WorldThe Sex PistolsDead KennedysThe ClashBasically anoyone elseAnd no I am not ""jealous"" of his ""skills."" Im pissed off about the fact that people who dont try hard and earn what they have, have everything, and people who try hard and basiclly sell their soul into what they are doing have nothing.EVEN EMO IS BETTER THAN THIS GRABGE!"
1,The movie is in Spanish with English subtitles,"I was so upset to find that this was spanish with english subtitles. None of the most helpful reviews tell you this, so be sure to pay close attention to the information that amazon does supply. You just have to read it for yourself. I want this movie in english sooooo bad!"
1,Bad Packaging with items,"Bad Service, tNexxus Headress Thickening Leave-In Volumizer Conditioner, Packaging May Vary, 13.5-Ounce BottleThey dont have good packaging with items,my item arrived broken to miami office.I'm disappointed, dont't spend their money."
1,coffee machine broke all of a sudden,"I have had this Cuisinart coffee maker now for alomst 3 years. I agree with all the previous comments about water condensation, leaking water and temperature problems. My biggest complaints are with the controls. My machine beeps and comes on with a mind of its own. its quite frustrating to have the aroma of coffee wafting through your house at 1am trust me!!!Last week though I went to set it for the next morning and it wouldn't work at all..I was quite puzzled, it just 'stopped' working for no apparent reason. Well i contacted Cuisinart and a very nice man phoned me back and said they were sending me a new machine...no questions asked !!! This I am even more puzzled at as no company has ever extended this type of service without receipts/and reviewing the product itself. Has anyone else had the same experience with this machine. is so i;d love to hear."
1,Not the same.,The shampoo does not look the same nor smell the same as the last purchase of it that I made. The prior product was clear this is yellow. Either they changed the product or this is not it.
1,Paint chipped immediately,"I was very disappointed with this toy. Paint chipped off the first time my daughter put it in her mouth, which is inevitable. I bought it in a store and it did not have a choking hazard/small parts warning. I wish I knew that before, but not sure what the small parts are or what 3+ year old would want to play with it. You're better off trying a clacker toy from another company -- Haba for instance."
1,Hmmmmmm,"Bought another one of these from the same vendor; a spray can - much better. This thing seems cheap. When you open it, you can see it is just a vitamin bottle glued in upside down. And it being cardboard, after a couple openings, it seems flimsy. Find the metal can-spray."
1,Boring!!!!!!,definitely not one of my favorites!!!! Slow and boring tale of a family whos son is kidnapped!!! Lindenburgh baby all over again!!!! Boring!!!!
1,Defective By Design,"Under NORMAL use and care, this device stopped working two weeks after purchase. As others have stated, water/toothpaste enter the interior, causing it to eventually malfunction. The store would only exchange for a new unit, so here's the bottom line: I'll just keep exchanging every two - three months for a new unit. How's that for 'Eco-Friendly'?"
1,Small book; small ideas,"This is a small book of small ideas. Mr Garvey has not written well in this book. He may know his stuff in real estate investing, but he has not written here in a way that is helpful. It is full of generalities, obvious statements, and irrelevancies. I was disappointed."
1,Not up to snuff,I have the old LP orginal cast album made back in the '60 or '70 which is wonderful. This new cast CD doesn't hold a candle to it. Hopefully they will reissue the old recording on CD one of these days. I certainly hope so. I don't like this on at all.Tim
1,"If I get eaten by a worm, I won't have to watch this . . .","There are different ways to approach a subject as complex as Dune:You can either take the time to tell the story properly, which requires either a mini-series or a series of movies (a la Lord of the Rings). You can also boil the story down to the bare minimum and tell a very basic story, or you can do what they attempted to do here, which was to take the entire story and compress it into two hours.The end result, of course is similar to flying over Disneyland. Sure, you get an idea of what's going on, but you miss actually experiencing it.Dune is like that. Huge chunks of narrative exposition and brief, shallow storytelling that doesn't have the time to explore anything in depth.Save yourself. Read the books."
1,Read more of the NEGATIVE REVIEWS - thumbs down,"This movie was pretty stupid, filled with dumb video effects and no clear theme. Everyone in it thought they were funny with stupid lines that did nothing but make the movie boring. There were no straight people in it to make Harold & Kumar look funny. Everyone had dumb lines. They broke the carnal rules of comedy. I kept waiting for it to get better but it didn't.I should have read more of the negative reviews and believed them. This movie is nothing like the first two. Those were humorous because of Harold and Kumar and the good dialog between them. They were the best movies in resent years almost as good as Cheech & Chong. The only good thing is I bought a used Blu-ray copy for $8"
1,Not Too Thrilled Over the Price,"I like my Sonicare and replace the brushes every 6 months. So I go online to order new A-Series brushes from Amazon like I always to and I see Amazon doesn't carry them, but an Amazon seller does ... for $70. Are they serious? That's more than I paid for the whole thing in the first place. How does the seller sleep at night? Does he feel any guilt?"
1,OK action but pretty shallow,Not a bad book but not memorable. Pretty predictable with shallow stereotypical characters. I enjoyed some of the larger implications of the attacks on the galactic communication grid but felt that the author left that aspect a bit unexplored to focus on the one conflict.
1,Didn't enjoy,"Found this book very disappointing. Found the book boring and difficult to get through. I was expecting an exciting book about growing up in Africa, unfortuntately found an almost-documentary, very un-exciting and didn't manage to finish the book. I am surprised that it had such a high price on it."
1,partly unconcerned,"made the mistake of reading and believing the previous reviews.wish i could have sampled this before deciding to buy.basically the album is an ill conceived attempt at trying toemulate george clintons funk mob - many have tried and many have failed,this is no exception.the tracks sound mundane and one dimensional which is disappointing considering the sizeable amount of personnelinvolved in the production.only on the final track 'let me come inside' does the captain earn his stars,displaying soulful vocals not evident on the rest of the album.perhaps with hindsight this is the route he should have taken."
1,Root canal is more fun.,"This book was unfortunately a monotonous, boring read, devoid of any insight that anyone with some form of learning or media outlet (TV, computers, print, etc) would not already have."
1,Dissapointed!,"The best 2 songs of the film - The opening Sequence and Madonna's Jump are missing from the so call soundtrack! I blindly purchased this trusting that it would be a complete soundtrack, and now I am dissapointed - It does feature plenty of background music I don't even remember from the movie."
1,Disappointed,"When I read the first few pages, I was perplexed. The opening reads like a mills and boon novel - I thought I had clicked the wrong book. How did this get 5 stars under 'literary fiction'. I have remained perplexed, and I am not finishing it."
1,Teach your kid how to speak with a speech impediment,My 3 year old daughter loves the show but the show creators thought a character with a speech impediment was cute. There are more entertaining shows that actually teach you child skills that are a better alternative. Team Umizoomi is great for math. Word World and the Leap Frog series teach reading. I would rate this 1 star but my daughter likes the show.
1,I Don't Understand the Public Sometimes...,"Why is this album a best-seller? These songs make me want to laugh (or sometimes just pinch the bridge of my nose and slowly shake my head).How can such beautiful voices result in such an awful CD?I guess because people were told that they would love this CD, they must. Sheep. Baaaaahh."
1,The Richard Clayderman of new age!,"Funny what happened to Yanni. He actually released a few very interesting albums in the 80's (particularly ""Out of Silence"", one of my all-time favorites), filled with memorable tunes, great orchestration, and, above all, a passion for music making that has been notably absent from his more recent works. Now he seems to have run out of ideas, and has truly become the Richard Clayderman of new age, endlessly producing inane, boring stuff. No wonder they've been churning out compilation after compilation: artistically, Yanni seems to be dead..."
1,Unknowm Item!,"Ordered this item mid July as it listed it in stock,never recieved item and finally recieved an e-mail from Sport and Sun claiming that I could recieve the product ""possibly"" in September. I work outside and I was looking forward to a hat that would protect my neck during the summer mths. Perhaps they can sell me a bathing suit in February!"
1,50 scientists CANNOT be found...,"John Ashton does his best, but he can't even come up with 50 scientists who support a young earth without including botanists, horticulture scientists, and mechanical engineers. Actually, fewer than half of the scientists presented in this book make specific arguments against an old earth. Their testimonials are sincere, but far from convincing for anyone looking for actual scientific evidence.Ashton, like all of the other answersingenesis crowd, suffers from an all or nothing mentality when it comes to supporting creation. Either one must swallow a narrow-minded interpretation of Genesis based on flawed hermeneutics, or one must reject God.Any reader who is looking for an honest evaluation of science within a Christian context will find nothing helpful here. If you are specifically looking for 50 scientists with evidence based arguments against an old earth, you won't find that anywhere."
1,It leaks,"This is our second Krup FMF5. It makes excellent coffee, has a thermos pot that keeps coffee hot, provides ""coffee interruptus,"" and can be operated without its water filter. However: (1) it requires conical filters, so you have to wet the filter as a chemist does to keep grounds out of your coffee. (2) It leaks -- it leaks unpredictably, and the useless water gauge with numbers so tiny a magnifying glass is required, is just one of the places where water leaks. Today, the useless water gauge was spouting. These cheap things made in China cost $100, so we are moving to a different brand."
1,The Dragon's boy,"Artos, an orphan, housed since birth by sir Ector and Lady Marion. Artos is in many ways just like Rudolph the red nosed reindeer. Until one day when he must go out into the woods in search of Sir Ector's missing brachet hound. He enters a cave in hopes that the hound is within, but instead of a hound he finds an old, but very wise dragon. From the knowledge that the dragon gives Artos, he is able to befriend and become an equal to Cai, Bedvere and Lancot, three boys around his age but much higher in ranking, or so it seems.It is a well-written book, but I didn't really like the style it was written in, it is also a slow moving book, so if you like slow moving books this is a good book for you. She went into a lot of detail about stuff that never happens, like what would happen if the dragon ate him. It's an okay book if you have nothing better to read, but lots of detail, which is okay sometimes but not always."
1,it's okay,"I just used this tape the other day. The instructor does a good job of explaining things, and they do spell out what you are doing very well. The only thing I didn't get out of it was a good workout. This would be fine if you are a beginner or are new to exercise, because it is helpful, but if you are used to working up a good sweat or feeling like you've really gotten a good workout, I didn't get that from this tape. So I would recommend for beginners, but not for someone who's done this for awhile."
1,Pass this one up if Sam annoys you!!,"Let's face it, Samantha Jones has GOT to be the worse companion ever for the Doctor to be saddled with and this novel just homes that point in. She's so annoying that I found myself skimming over her parts and getting back to the Doctor. (If I hear one more bit about her being against eating meat and against violence one more time I'll scream!) No, in fact I refuse to buy any more DW books until Sam gets kicked out!! If you like Sam, then get this book. If you find her an insufferable moronic idiot, do yourself a favor and pass this one up. You'll save your blood pressure! Otherwise this story is rather standard fare, nothing really spectacular."
1,Speakers are not very good speakers,"In showing several segments of this lecture with teens, my opinion is that the OB/GYN speaks too fast and looks to the side as if reading. He has one of the longest parts and he races along with an odd cadence. The older woman speaks slowly and well and more attention was paid to her and the younger woman speaking about planned parenthood. The Dr. (Urologist)seemed bored with the subject.There are many other DVD's out there that also show teens speaking about the peer pressure and need for education that had my audience rivited to the screen. As another reviewer said, this is a lecture on tape. There is no interaction with others, no questions from an audience are answered and even if I was a student interested in the subject, this video was too much information in too short a time, presented in a way that showed no creativity and created no interest."
1,PRETTY MUCH OF A YAWNER!!!!,"I made it about half way through it.It reminded me of a dog chasing itsown tail,,,,,,and never catching it.The book was interesting for about 100pages, then, it all started to sound the same.And the cast of characters????? Who could keep trackof them all!!!!"
1,Didn't Receive This Item,"I've been asked to share my input, but since I didn't get this item which was a BD present for a neice, I can only say that I am more than disappointed."
1,"Ok, if you don't mind your monitor crooked......","Mounted to wall, used a level, Got it installed without much issue. However, after attaching monitor it is ""straight"" or level if the mounted is not extended from wall. If I pull the articulating arm out from wall the monitor wants to lean because the mount has to much play in how the arms connect. Otherwise not a bad monitor mount for the cost."
1,Never Will I buy an Intex Product again,"I did not buy my Intex Supreme Air-Flow Queen Airbed Nylon Flocked with Built-in Electric Pump from Amazon but I will never buy another Intex product ever again. I bought this product in June 2011, and by early July a small bulge or pop up came about at the end of the bed. I thought well maybe it was from the way I was laying. So that night I put the airbed back up and now there were two bulges/popup and the new one right in the middle looking like a watermelon! I emailed the company and all they told me was to speak with the store I bought it from and they hoped that this wouldnt lead me away from Intex brand. Well it has and I am completely disgusted with all of this. What a waste of $120.00"
1,Amazon.com is Irresponsible,"I ordered these. They came in a cardboard box with NO PADDING. They shattered. I asked for replacements and asked them to pad them. Those ALSO shattered because they weren't padded. The third time I called they said they can't promised they'd be padded and gave me a refund! I still want these, but they won't send them again because they can't tell the shipping people to pad them. Ridiculous."
1,NOt for techno,I have had these headphones for about a month or two at tops and i listen to mostly techno and recently i have had a very annoying noise in my ear from to much bass THESE ARE NOT FOR HARDCORE TECHNO PEOPLE
1,WARNING--DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!,"I purchased this recorder from Amazon, and now I find out that it is incompatable with all of the new 8X DVD-R dics that are coming out. These new disks are supposed to be downward compatible (work with 1X thru 8X), but not on this recorder. The old 4X are being phased out in favor of the better, AND LESS EXPENSIVE, 8X variety, and are very hard to find. I confirmed all this with Sylvania tech support. They just said: ""We do apologize for the misunderstanding and any inconvenience."""
1,"Everyone that reviewed this album, THANK YOU.","I am so grateful that you guys told me that this is NOT the soundtrack thats being sold. I was looking for at least an hour for the music (meaning rock/pop songs) from this movie. I agree with everyone here, it's the music that made the movie, songs from radiohead and guster . The movie was great but the songs brought it home. Thank you for saving me the money and sharing your knowledge with all. Does anyone know if the songs will be released on a seperate soundtrack? I hope so."
1,bearspet,"I agree with the majority of the reviews - the battery life is horrible. It worked great when the battery was charged, but after a bit the battery would no longer charge no matter how long I kept it plugged in. I finally trashed the whole thing."
1,Blah,It could have been better for sure it took 70% in before anything really happened. Won't be reading anymore Bourdain fiction.
1,Yo...,"Are you f'ning kidding me?! this is an excuse for hipster parents to seem cool. I am sorry nothing in this show has every brought me, my kids or the world joy. I put this on the other day for my 1 and a half year old and my 5 year old. My youngest watched it for like 5 minutes and vomited, and the older one begged me to turn it off, HE BEGGED!!"
1,wtf,"What idiot put together this soundtrack? It doesn't have the key songs. The mood setting songs. The good songs. How can you leave Closer or Heart's Filthy Less off this soundtrack? This sounds more like one from a sappy ass chick flick rather than a psychological thriller. Instead of NIN or David Bowie the put in Billie Holiday and Marvin Gaye. That just screams serial killer. Not saying anything bad about them, but they wouldn't be my first choice to put on the soundtrack this should have been. It's really pathetic."
1,I should have listened to other reviews,"Even though I had read some reviews regarding this book which were not very favorable, I bought the book anyway for the mere reason I had read Sand's ""Renegade Hunter"" and ""Single White Vampire"" both of which I liked. I was very disappointed in Bite Me if You Can. There was no romance whatsoever. Each page I turned, I was hoping for a tease....but it did not come.....still page turning until 3/4 of the book had been read and nothing! Like most books, the author teases us with sexual desire. This book did not even do that! There was no teasing, no love, no romance, and.....no sexual desires like other books written by Cole, Lara Adrian, Gena Showalter. It was a complete waste of money and reading time. Next time I will pay more attention to what others write."
1,Too much lint,"In the washing machine, this pad gave off lint that got stuck to the rest of the wash, and fills the lint trap in the dryer. It really made a mess of my laundry. I don't recommend it at all."
1,"Should be called ""Bad Movie Island""","I don't understand why this movie has received so many positive reviews. ""Shutter Island"" has the makings of a good thriller but never gets off the ground. The plot is good, the cast is great, and the cinematography is super cool. But everything else is just downright stupid: not scary, not creepy, and super obvious. I felt like Scorsese was dumbing down to his audience the whole time. The trailers for this film were much better than the actual movie. Skip this one."
1,Don't use on Toyota Prius Touring Edition,"These cables are a nightmare to install on a 2007 Toyota Prius Touring Edition. The cables simply seem too small. It took me about an hour to finally get these installed, and then, after just a few miles at 20 MPH, bam! One of the connectors came unhooked, and they got all tangled up inside the wheel. I had to call AAA for help getting the cables out of the wheel (this is really fun to do in the middle of a snow storm on the mountain pass), and now I have to take my car into the Toyota dealer to find out what all was damaged by this product. What a nightmare!"
1,Bring back the Peaceful Planet Aquarium!,"We bought this for our infant daughter as a replacement for my older son's Peaceful Planet Aquarium. At first, I was pleased by this product's design and the addition of toys for the child. However, when we began using it, we HATED it! First of all, as others have noted, the motor is excrutiatingly loud to the point that it drowns out the soothing sounds. Second, the lights are too bright for use in a dark room when trying to soothe (not shock) delicate little eyes. Finally, the music on this product is too radio-like, not like the tinkling little lullablies found on its predecessor. After using it for two nights, I put it back in the box and returned it to the store. This toy would fall under the old adage...if it isn't broken, don't fix it! Fisher Price really goofed on this ""improvement."""
1,No Substance,"I can't believe that any of the other reviewers have experience trading stocks. This book doesn't give you any concrete startegies. Basically stick with the top 100 volume pennies and then scan the online boards for ideas. He says to have a plan for exits, but it is basically take a guess - no rational. In one example he has a 5 stock portfolio, then ""adds"" up all the gains and says he had a net return of over 1800%. While still impressive, the gain on the portfolio is closer to 400%.The only decent advice is to use limit orders so you don't whacked by slippage, and to do due diligence (though he admits he doesn't on most picks). This book is pretty much an intro to pennies then fly by the seat of your pants. It doesn't deal with pennies on the NASDAQ or NYSE, just OTCBB and pink sheets."
1,"Not very good, boring","This book was assigned to me for school, and it never really drew me in. Good detail about Japan, though. Otherwise, I wish I didn't have to read it."
1,ROMAN POLANSKI CHILD MOLESTER.,"I would not spend a dime on anything that Roman Polanski the child molester is involved with. Does anyone remember that he drugged a teenager and raped her many years ago and then fled the country like the coward he is. If you have any children you should feel the same. These monsters masquerading as ""artists"" should never be forgiven. Of course he roams around freely in Europe with the other trash in the film industry. Strangely enough the victim has forgiven him but a message must be sent that hideous acts like the one Polanski bestowed upon his victim must never be forgiven. He is scum of the lowest nature, a devil in an intellectual abyss of misguided power that believes he is better than any woman could ever be."
1,Not for rookie investors,"This is suppose to be an excellent book but if you are looking for an easy read, you are mistaken. I am a rookie investor and he just confused me."
1,too fancy!,"Way too fancy for your average BBQ fan. Unless you like goat cheese and fennel on your quale, yes thats right quale, then you will not like this book. As a matter of fact, i dont think there is one recipe that uses a good old BEEF as the main ingredient. Make the meals in this book and you will be hungry 10 minutes later. Doesn't help that the Author is from England, not much BBQing going on there! The ""encyclopedia of"" collection is fantastic but they made a mistake with this authur!"
1,Easy to use but highly disappointing!,"I knew that this MP3 player was too good to be true.It worked pproperly for the first day then started to go haywire. The scan button gets stuck so each time you skip a song,it thinks you just want to fast forward.It juices the battery like you wouldnt believe and the FM tuner function completely shuts down the player and you can turn the player on for hoours after that!I have tried to contact Coby and have yet to get a real reply.Any warranty work takes 6-8weeks to repair or replace.Try explaining 6-8 weeks to a 7 year old.I only bought this cause it was a good MAC alternative to the IPOD,but low and behold I am going to purchase an IPOD. Do not buy this product,it is not worth the hassle."
1,Not representative of MCAT questions,"These 1001 books are not representative of the way you need to know material for the MCAT. They focus on having the equations memorized to be able to solve their questions, whereas many of the MCAT passages offer the equation in the passages if you need them."
1,not that great,"got these for my bf to play softball, good price but less than dollar store quality for sure. the lenses came out with in a week of getting them. guess i cant expect much for this cheap/"
1,Don't waste your time with this!,"About halfway through this book I started getting annoyed with the main character, Maurice. He was extremely sappy and emotional. He spent most of his time moping over a woman he couldn't have. I decided to skip to the end to see if it was worth it to continue. The end was so terrible, I was glad I didn't waste my time reading the whole thing."
1,Are you kidding me??,"This was the WORST shipping job I have ever seen in my life! ( and I shop online A LOT)! it was shipped it it's actual box only, nothing to protect it, so to no surprise the box is tore open! For the eight bucks they charge for shipping it was a joke! I'd rather pay more so they can spring for at least bubble wrap and masking tape! Just received it today so I have yet to see if it works. It would be a miracle if it does! We got it for a gift, I am embarrassed to give a box looking like this, so to avoid the hassle of returning and hoping I get the gift in time I'm heading to Target! Be wary ordering from here, unless u enjoy getting broken items in the mail. I'm giving it 2 stars on the chance it may work when I plug it in."
1,I got the wrong book,Interchange Student's Book 3 with Audio CD (Interchange Third Edition)I got the wrong book and it wasted my time to wait for this book and then sent it back.
1,trash it,"Got it for a penny, read the first chapter, then threw it away. Sorry I can't give a review on the whole thing, but it wasn't worth my valuable time."
1,center holes too small to get drain strainer out,I love the way these look but the center holes are too small to get your sink strainer out. You have to lift up the grid to empty the strainer. This doesn't make sense. We have standard-size strainers.
1,Total Junk,"This product was exactly what I was looking for as my daughter has a ton of shoes. I bought three of them and they fit perfectly in the bottom of her closet. Unfortunately, they only lasted maybe a month before they fell apart. My daugher has a lot of tennis shoes and the plastic was unable to withstand the weight of the shoes. The whole rack kept collapsing."
1,i am switching from this junk,I have used ACT for three years and have a huge investment in the data it holds but I am moving to Lotus after trying to use this newest version. IT IS JUNK. I stayed with ACT waiting for a decent email interface hoping that it would make the product usable again. Alas it was not to be.
1,One word - Overrated,"Save your money, and just buy The Game cd since the only good song (Just a Lil Bit) on this cd is on the Documentary too. The only other possibility is Candy shop, but I got sick of this song back when it was called magic stick."
1,Terrible,I only had 100 pages left to go in this book and gave up. It was completely boring. The Abe Leiberman novels are better.
1,Typical Spark,"This book follows the usual Sparks formula. Man meets woman. Man has sex with woman. And, man usually dies. If you've read one of his books, you've read 'em all."
1,Somebody's Heart Is burning: A Woman Wanderer in Africa,I found this book poorly written and a boring read.
1,Are you serious$20 for one notebook,Ok I have heard of expensive notebooks but this is just outrageous $20 for one notebook. Are the sheets made of gold. I hope no one seriously buys this crap.
1,Mangled Puppy,"Almsot every track on this is butchered beyond recognition. I like good remixes. These aren't good remixes. Worlock {ed} off of The Singles Collect was a good remix. Killing Game (Bent Mix) is five minutes of noise. None of the remixes are anywhere close to as good as the originals. The only two remixes on this album I like are Ogre and Mark Walk's Smothered Hope remix and Guenter Schulz's Addiction (Opium) mix. Skinny Puppy is one of my favorite bands, but it just hurts to listen to this album. I would steer clear of this and get ANY other Skinny Puppy album. The only reason to get this is if you have all the other Skinny Puppy albums and just want this one to complete your collection."
1,Disappointing,A very pessimistic take on our great country for purposes of pushing a political agenda. Its no wonder this book is so well liked by the New York Times. There is too much opinion and not enough evidence in the pages of this book.
1,The Outsiders,"I purchased the Outsiders from ckellyphila@verizon.net and never received my movie. I did send an e-mail to this person asking about the movie and never got a response back. If this person does not have the movie or does not want to send it out, they should not advertise the movie for sale. I will double check to make sure my account was not charged for the item I never received. Melissa Hinman"
1,Horrible Product,This camera should be taken off the market. I understand at this price-level you can't expect the quality of a $500 camera but even at $20 this camera would be overpriced. The image quality is very pixalated. I have seen 1 Megapixel cameras that take better pictures than this one. The battery life indicator is always showing batteries that are half drained; even with new batteries. The viewer looks really bad and cannot keep up with any movement. I brought this camera back the next day. I purchased a Kodak 6330 for a few dollars more and am very impressed with it.
1,Don't do it save your money,I was sent a pacific coast brand comforter filled with about three feathers in it.Don't waste your money you'll just end up paying extra to return it.
1,"Better than the Original, and That's It.","Viewed: 1/13Rate: 31/13: Slightly better than the original, Addams Family Values still retains characters that I cannot stand. And this time, they've decided to add another actress that I've hated for years: Joan Cusack. Since Addams Family Values is meant to be a film for kids, Joan Cusack's cleavage is at a full-front assault in every scene she appears in. Admittedly, Addams Family Values has many clever ideas and is a way better film than whatever the crap Tim Burton could come up with. All in all, only if I could stand the characters, Addams Family Values might have worked out better for me, but it has racist undertones."
1,I am sorry I bought and read this book,"I usually love historical novels of this time period and have read many, but this is one I wish I had not read. I should have stopped reading when the author turned Queen Elizabeth I into a nasty old child molester. The characters were not believable and nor were the situations they found themselves in. If you want to read really good mysteries/novels from this time period I highly recommend anything written by Karen Harper."
1,God awful,Clearly a compilations of clinches and stereotypes from someone who has never interacted with those he has decided to describe or poke fun at. Potentially could have been hilarious but the author didn't have the chops to make it so.
1,my movie,It wasn't what I expected. it was very dark and I don't like the movie for my kids. the price and shipping were the only good part of that movie
1,Stay far far away,"Unlike the series, this 'movie' is completely unfunny and boring. nothing of interest happens throughout Stewie's ""journey"" (which, doesn't even begin until 60 minutes in. The plot is terrible, and the writing moreso.Buy one of the boxsets, or 'best of' collections of Family Guy if you want to laugh, but avoid this. Unfunny. Boring. Poorly written. Terrible plot."
1,Not very effective,"I found that the dose recommended on bottlle (4 oz./10,000 gallons in a pool) had zero effect on the pH in our pool. I had to put in 4 Xs as much to lower the pH significantly. So I'll go back to buying muriatic acid from our local pool supply store."
1,"Worthless, Waste of Time, Unreliable","Out of the box, it worked approximately a quarter of the time on the same computer (iBook OSX). Same thing occured on other computers (PCs). Complete waste of money and time trying to deal with it. Scandisk costumer support was worthless, giving pre-made information from a similar questions and it still did not work. Don't by Scandisk."
1,Horrible Batteries,"The battery charger works well, but the batteries suck. They have too high of a self discharge rate. Buy some Sanyo batteries!"
1,there are better books,"i bought this book because i read the review that gave this five stars. as a resident of washington state, i was very disappointed with the restaurant and hotel suggestions provided. since when should the space needle restaurant be a 'recommended restaurant?' it's pricey and noisy, and the food is ok - exactly what you'd expect from a touristy place. you are better off having a GREAT takeout meal at the buffalo deli on 1st avenue - which has the best sandwiches downtown - and taking your lunch to pike market to watch the ferries.what about great, out of the way places to stay, like pensione nichols, which is inexpensive and charming?you are better off buying the fodor's gold guide, or frommer's guide to washington state if you are looking for 'local color.'"
1,Broken every time,This is the second Tureen I have ordered from this company that is broken. I will be returning it for the second time now and looking for somewhere else to purchase one.
1,chateau knife by oneida,The knives did not match the set I have. They are alot thinner and not as heavy. Maybe they changed their weight. Delivery was quick
1,Failed concept.,"I was desperate after not being able to rid of a UTI that was ongoing for 7 days. This is the first time it's happened to me. I did my research and many others found this to be very helpful. I thought it had potential.. until I tried it. I took this sugar 2 to 3 times a day, sometimes mixed with water but usually with 100% pure, disgusting, sour cranberry juice. I felt no different! I gave it 5 days of use before giving up and helplessly accepting anti-biotics from my doctor. This did nothing for me but waste money but you're free to try for yourself."
1,Unimpressed,"This item arrived with one arm broken off:/ Also, I understand there are molding irregularities, but this Spiderman bank had SO MANY black streaks where it is supposed to be red or blue. I guess I can't complain too much since it was so cheap to purchase and is for a child. We fixed the arm ourselves instead of dealing with sending it back. Should work fine."
1,Good size but not very convenient.,"I tried the SuperPet cages with ferrets and rats. While SuperPet models do offer a ton of space for your fuzzies, the design is just not user-friendly. The doors are very small and it can be tough getting access to all of your food dishes, hanging toys, and critters. The shelves have a little groove on the inside which tends to collect urine, kibble, and water. They do not unhook from the cage easily, so unless you wipe everything down before pulling it out, you're likely to scatter yuckiness everywhere.The cages are very heavy and awkward. Yes, you can unhook them from the bottom and clean them as two separate pieces, but getting both to a bathroom or outside for cleaning can be a real chore. They do offer a lot of customization possibilities, but the difficulty of moving things around and putting things back in after a cleaning are just not worth it. I'd rather get a Ferret Nation or a Martin's."
1,Not Bad for newbies,"If you're a newbies in hacking, this book cover almost everything but it's not in detail."
1,A promising storyline let down by mediocre prose,"In a world where one can be judged by the company she keeps, the author makes the catastrophic blunder of creating an uncaring lead character. With prose resembling a 3rd grader's blackboard scrawlings, Ms Quindlen paints a surpisingly unaffecting, as well as uninspiring landscape into the horrific problem of domestic abuse. Conjuring up dark images, with dry underpinnings, may work for those of the narcisistic pursuasion, but is not the most effective way to develop a heroine. What should be a bitter, albeit important lesson in life's hard knocks, turns into an ordeal for the reader, rivaled only by that of the lead character. Even more disturbing is the macabre humor Ms Quinlan attempts to inject into an otherwise dark story. we see two forces at battle here for control of the novel's direction and unfortuanely the less enlightened side won out."
1,Dreadful,"Right off the bat, yes, I'm an avid gamer. I can very easily laugh at myself and my hobby, so that's not why I'm about to pan this movie.To be fair, I give these guys credit for persistance. They nagged friends of mine who work in two separate local game stores to carry this DVD. As a result, and because my friends value my opinion, I got a chance to sit down and watch this movie for free...and I still want a refund.This movie is like being trapped at while a D&D; player insists on telling you about his character or a game he played in. We all found it dull and uninspiring, and, in the interest of total honesty, we could not get all the way through it.There are better movies about gaming, serious and non. I recommend you seek them out and save your money for them."
1,Not What It Appeared to Be,"I was very anxious to solve my property management problems with QuickBooks, and was taken by the title. Unfortunately, I didn't notice in the description that this is a 99-pg. spiral bound book. And it costs over $40! It is very basic, fairly elementary, and does not give extensive information with various scenarios as one might expect from a real BOOK! Additionally, in skimming the book today, I notice that the proofreader wasn't up to the job.This guide is OK for a beginner, but it's more a ""Quick Start"" guide than anything else."
1,Duncan can't pull this one off for me!,"I respect Duncan Sheik. His self-titled debut was great and he seems to really care more about his art than his wallet. ""Phantom"" fell short in a number of areas for me. Many of the melodies seem recycled and Sater's lyrics weren't inspiring enough to hold my attention. To me, this a collection of sophis- ticated camp songs -picturesque in presentation but lacking in substance. Some of the stuff reminds me of that dreadful overlong dirge on ""Humming"" called ""Nichiren"". That said,I'm glad I picked this cd up in a used bin."
1,"""Gothika"" promises chills, but it's all tame spills!","Halle Berry plays Dr. Miranda Grey, a brilliant doctor in a mental institution who wakes up one morning as a patient in her own hospital and begins to be visited by a female ghost in most ""horrifying,"" as the studio would lead you to believe, ways. I'll ignore the fact that the hospital's lights are always blinking and much of the equipment resembles a 1500s torture machine. But I refuse to ignore the blatant disregard for non-cheap thrills, quality acting, and screenplay (This ""script"" has more plot holes than 200 STAR TREK episodes). At the end of the day, it's somewhat entertaining, but obvious and easy to forget."
1,acceptable nighttime fluff,"A somewhat pedestrian sequel continuing Anna's travails through what is essentially a fantasy-by-the-numbers world. Anna lurches from crisis to crisis solving them with ruthless efficiency and in doing this, Modesitt has avoided the common tendancy to have a supremely powerful character agonise for chapters before taking action that most of us would realise is inevitable. Don't look to this book for in depth characterisations or novel concepts. Treat it as light reading and you won't be disappointed."
1,"No, No, No! Ezzo is Evil!","The American Academy of Pediatrics, La Leche League, and countless other respected entities have come out against Gary Ezzo and his ""babywise"" method. According to the AAP, the infant feeding program outlined in Babywise has been ""associated with failure to thrive (FTT), poor weight gain, dehydration, breast milk supply failure, and involuntary early weaning."" Ezzo has NO medical credentials. Zero, zip, nada. His advice is medically unsound and dangerous and should not be followed!!"
1,"Dated, But Kept My Interest","This movie is VERY dated and does not stand the test of time. A mediorce movie in its day, is not even that by today's standards especially by how much we now know about the condition of Titanic. Not a very plausible movie, I mainly just bought because I wanted to see it as a kid and did not. If you see this movie in a $1 rack - buy to satisfy your curiousity, but do not waste a good afternoon with it. Save it for a rainy day when there is nothing else to watch."
1,NOT MAC FRIENDLY,"I guess in China, they have never heard of Macintosh (They only build them), because this product does not work with a Mac. I imagine after spending more money on really sophisticated video converters might help. The disc that they give you with the install/video converter is a 3Inch disc that will not work on any side loaded iMac, which is pretty much all of them, and it wouldn't work anyway because they are exe. files, which Mac's don't read. When I did get a video to work, it was after trying over a dozen files. The player is very picky about what files it decides it will like.The interface takes a bit getting used to as well, but at least it looks really good. However, not good enough to waist your time."
1,Not a good product,People complained about echo whenever i use the bluetooth. Wouldn't connect easily to phone.
1,got just what I paid for,got just what I paid for. Handles are riveted on and will leak. they are super light weight. stamped out lids are warped but like I said only got what I paid for and they are working for me.
1,Don't waste your money!!!!!,I bought this cookie press 2 years ago & only use it at Christmas.The first year it worked great but while I was using it this yearthe collar just under the handle started to crack. I was able to finish mycookies but now the press is useless. I called Wilton's 1-800-794-5866They will send me a new cookie press (same old style) or if I send them the differenceI can get an up graded model. I've read the reviews on the other models & they don't seem to be much better.I think I'll try a different Company.
1,What?,"OK, while i dont mean to be offensive, the americans dont really do gothic music properly. Its all too industrial and cheesy which is why i prefer Nightwish, Lacuna Coil and Arch Enemy ( A really good European death metal band with a woman singer). Ok, so Evanescence do have some good songs but i mean, they sound like linkin park which i hate. Please, the band is just bad and amy can shove her bring me to life song chorus up her a** because id rather bring her to death!"
1,Dissapointing,"Lee has learned some of the basics - get the reader's interest, make a character that the reader can like, get in some good scenery, some action, and some sex.What he didn't learn, however, was the rest of what makes a satisfying book. The main character doesn't grow or develop (we're *told* that he's changed, but he doesn't act any different), and he's whiney. He throws in sex scenes to plaster over plot holes/lack of plot development. Tehani is far more interesting than Hunter, but she's relegated to Sex Interest. And the ending...very disappointing.I wanted to red ink the whole thing and send it back to him. I wouldn't read it twice. This is a slapdash piece of work."
1,it is done whitney is finally with jesus amen,for those whitney fans who wanna hear her explore her gospel roots even though she was heavily addicted to crack cocaine when she made this album and the film but hey if anybody did'nt think whitney was an cult member think again she sure had ya'll fooled with that jesus con game but hey guess if you wanna suceed you have to play the jesus con game to fool the public while secretly serving satan.
1,Came off right away,"Kidkusion Gummi Crib RailOverall, this product sounded like a good idea and came off the next day. Don't buy it."
1,"The ""Legend of the Seeker"" books","Well these are the books that the T.V. series ""Legend of the Seeker"" is based on but i can't say it's the best paper material I have ever seen. I am talking about the material and not the inside of the books(story). The worst paper stock ever........"
1,Do not buy from Home & Beyond,I bought a channel master 4221. It comes form Polsteins Home & Beyond. They sent me a damaged antenna. I returned it and they sent me the exact same antenna back in the exact same box. It even had the note I wrote to them in the box. They just put it back in stock and then resent it to me. A very dishonest company. I still have yet to get my money back. DO NOT BUY anything form Home & Beyond.
1,Not my dream carseat,"The first one arrived with the wrong pieces, so we were unable to put the sunshade together. We sent it back. The second one came with all the right pieces, but even then I can't say I'm thrilled. The seat is much more confining than the one I used to have, and the baby is far less comfortable; he gets all smushed up inside. Also, it sits up v. high in the car instead of tilting back so his head is always hanging forward, despite the head roll, which is utterly ineffective. Lastly, the parts that need to be pushed in in order to lift or lower the handle are so stiff that I have a very hard time moving the handle (so does my much stronger husband for that matter). Overall, a good price and looks cute, but not fabulously functional."
1,After 18months...kaput,"I normally hold the KitchenAid in high regard, and had registered for this blender for my wedding.When we got it, I was so excited - the red was gorgeous and matched my KitchenAid Artisan Mixer (which I love.)We've had it now for 18months, and the blade has broken in half today. We used it on and off, but recently have used it daily for about 2 months to make morning smoothies.If you use it to make more than 6 smoothies back to back, the base will heat up. So I normally can't make too many at any one time.The blades also tend to get stuck and the motor heats up. So when making smoothies, I have to go through every speed before I can go to liquefy. Otherwise, the food doesn't get well blended.I was hoping that the blender would last longer than it has - especially for the price.I may buy a new blade, but haven't found great reviews for that either.Pretty disappointed."
1,waste of money,"This product had mixed reviews but I loved the concept and purchased as a first fathers day gift....the frame is nice but the ""kit"" for making the footprint is cheap and DOES NOT WORK.....I followed the instuctions and the footprint would not show up well or hold its shape......This product was not worth the money....now I have an OK frame to put pictures in and have to start over in finding a good fathers day gift....very disapointed!"
1,"Cursing in a ""children's"" book?! For shame!","As a middle school teacher and as a mother, I don't let my children or students use some of the language in this book. Why would I allow them to read it? The mother is a very poor example of what a mother should and should not do--smoking indoors around a baby and child and leaving an eight-year-old alone with a baby. There is no redeeming value in this book. I can't believe it won a Newberry Honor medal."
1,entertaining but...,"i found the book to be mildly entertaining...as previous reviews have stated this guys knowledge of computers isn't more than skin-deep (or windows-deep, heh)the plot was fairly predictable and the characters were extermely linear.i would hope this book is not normal for Dan Brown's work..."
1,SkippyJon Doll,"I was disappointed with the size of the doll. It is very small and disproportionate. The head is to ""beeg"" for its body! It won't stand up on its own, so he has to stay propped up against something at all times. For $8.00 I expected a little better."
1,Blah....blah....blah.....,"This isn't an autobiography about someone challenging themselves with a journey to build strength of character, to find spiritual enlightenment, or seeking answers to life's questions.... This is the tale of a whining, self absorbed, grieving, gender confused woman, running away from the life she has. The only thing she seeks is someone to tell her its okay to dump her husband and come out of the closet. Yippie, good for you, but not an inspirational or interesting read!The book is as poorly planned out as her trip was. Improper clothing and gear, poor planning of landing/camp sites, gross misjudgments of distances, weather conditions, and abilities. The only thing amazing about her journey is that she didn't die from her own stupidity.I've kayaked on Lake Superior.... Too bad she spent so much time drifting in her own insecurities to fully enjoy the trip..... I'd scatter the book to the four winds, except that would be littering."
1,Bad end-of-chapter exercises,"This is a good book to learn VB from, until you get to the Chapter 7 end-of-chapter exercises. They make up a project that the reader is not at all equipped to produce. Wrox should come up with a different set of end-of-chapter exercises and make them downloadable."
1,Does not measure blood pressure accurately,"I just recieved this product , tested it and it gave largely varried results and did not give one correct reading. Its a defective instrument with defective design stay away from the product and keep your money in your pocket."
1,Used to be happy,"After being an avid reader of books, the first time i used a Kindle i was sold on the product. However, after having owned my Kindle for just over a year, 376 days to be concise. I turned it on one night and noticed lines across the screen, this has got progressivly worse over the past few days to the point where i am unable to read.I contacted Amazon who kindly told me that i was out of warranty but could buy another one that was re-conditioned.Having dealt with the excellent customer service over at Apple, i was amazed at quite unhelpful they were.So after this, i will be buying either the Nook or Kobo to see if they manage to last longer."
1,Got Zapped,"Put me on the list of those who received a defective one in the mail. I put in the batteries, pressed the switch and nothing happened. I have one from a different manufacturer that works fine, so it was clearly defective."
1,poor manufacutring quality,"At the beginning, I did take some good portraites with this camera. But after 13 month and 800 shots, the following problems emerge:1.the on/off switch doesn't work.2.the camera can't read CF card.3.meter overexpose.4.loose focusing.Cost to fix them? $250.00If you are professional or serious amateur photographer,Don't buy this camera just because it's cheap."
1,Doesn't pump well,"I bought this thinking that it was an equivalent to the full size bike pumps for flat tires. Even though I was ignorant, I think the sellers should have made it clear that this was NOT to be used for fixing general flats. I asked some bike shop owners and, for those of you who are thinking of buying this, please note that it's only for emergencies where it needs a tiny bit more air to make it until you can get to a proper bike pump.Even when I tried to use it in the conditions that it was apparently made for, it barely pumped in any air at all. I lost more air than I could get into the tire.The only reason I couldn't return it was that I waited too long to use it and I had passed the final return date."
1,Not worth the money,I expected great things from this product after reading great reviews. I have a german shepherd. All this product did was make her hair fly all over the place and up my nose! A regular brush catches the hair much better and my dog seems to enjoy it more.
1,MOON OF THE WOLF,"This movie is CRAP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! For being one of those 1972 horror classics, it definitely isn't! It is so boring and the wolf doesn't come till the end of the movie. In the future I hope movies never ever turn out to be as bad as this one!"
1,Not what the title says...,"Maybe it just me, or perhaps I should have read a bit of it in a store instead of ordering near blind on line. ""Career Management for the Creative Person"" should have been titled ""Are You Interested in a Creative Career?"" It is bursting at the spine with self-examination test to discover if you're a creative right brain type or not. While this book may be good for those who are doing some serious soul searching, it is not for those who already know and embrace their right brain and are just looking for a kick in the rump to get back on track."
1,2 Stars for the front access,"We bought this coffee maker at Target (cheaper on Amazon) and have had it less than 90 days. It has never seemed to make very hot coffee and now the burner has quit working all together. I really liked the front access feature, but other than that it was a waste of money."
1,Not sellers fault,I forgot I even bought this book. Usually I love finance books. I take them on vacation and order several magazines. But this book has an introduction that promises how funny the book is. Then a couple more that promises how humorous the book is. And then some more chapters that i can't even remember Then I put it down out of boredom and don't know where it is.
1,"OK, but the sequel sounds better . . .","You don't really expect much from a book like this, which is good considering all you get. Another big hairy monster is prowling the seas, eating people and wrecking ships. This time it's a previously supposed-extinct prehistoric shark, and Only One Man Knew It Was Still . . . OUT THERE! Yawn. Two dimensional characters, a silly plot, and zero tension/excitement/suspense/fear. Perhaps Mr. Alten should name his second novel ""Watching Paint Dry""? It would be more exciting than his first.Seriously, though, his sequel, ""The Trench"", does sound like it'll be quite fun. From what I gather he's finally dropping everything else and going down the same road as ""Godzilla"". Good for him.I'll be looking out for ""The Trench"". As for ""Meg""; I wouldn't even bother."
1,Terrible execution - great idea,Tried 3 replacements of this toy. All three had issues ranging from some of the buttons not working to having the body separate from the head in the screen. Don't waste your money.
1,they are stealing the bait,"At first it worked great. For the last few days now, when I have gone to check the trap in the morning, the well has been licked dry. Sometimes when I check the trigger with a pencil the trap doesn't go off until I really push hard. The mice are stealing the bait and laughing all the way to their hideout."
1,Horrifiying,Cradle of fiflth's members are posers and horrifing beyond all belief if you see a picture of them i swear youll laugh your head off there music is nowhere near black metal and they need to stop making music or whatever.......:) :( :)
1,Does not fit BMW as the site said,"I had to force it in after enlarging the holder in order to fit. Also, it leaves streaks after a few uses."
1,Not what it seems,"While looking at the ""look inside"" it seemed that the hard cover of the book was red with a tiger holding an umbrella. I was really looking for the specific feature of this book and it was not the case."
1,Deeply flawed but with flashes of genius,"Kate Bush is a phenomenal songwriter and musician but overreaches here with a rather pretentious attempt at directing what is really little more than a colection of six music videos from the Red Shoes album. Trying too hard, Kate looks tired and out of her depth in a series of rather risible scenes which rather obviously ape Michael Powell's style. It is a pity that Kate did not limit herself to what she does best and bring in an experienced director. But here it is, complete with self-congratulatory credits and lamentable design, ham acting and cliched photography. Kate Bush fans will love it (but they are hardly an objective bunch) while it is hard to imagine anyone else taking it seriously. What a sad waste of resources."
1,Doesn't work with Panther,"Supposedly this is a good game, but until MacPlay updates it to work with both Quicktime 6.5 and Mac OSX 10.3 it is a waste of money."
1,You get what you pay for,"I so wanted this and was looking forward to receiving it. I was hoping it would help me greatly with my pictures for my online store. However, it didn't.First of all there are no instructions.Secondly the tents (especially the larger one) are hard to put back into the folded position.The extra backgrounds are all folded up and the creases are impossible to get out even after lots of attempts to iron them out.The store away case is actually pretty handy as I've given this set 3 tries and it hasn't left the closet since."
1,Not my cup of tea,"I clicked on this video because it had a five star average. I'm so glad that I didn't pay for this. The first few minutes were spent with him screaming about how fat people should die of the swine flu because fat people somehow are so annoying to him that they don't deserve to exist. I generally don't like comedians who rely on fat jokes, racist jokes, bathroom humor or the like. The cursing doesn't bother me, but it seems like he relied on it so much to be edgy. Maybe I'm just not in a good mood right now, but I stopped it within a few minutes. I may give it another shot at another time and give it a higher review since I didn't watch all of it. He annoyed me within minutes. By the way, everyone who has given an unfavorable review has had hoardes of his fans reply with hateful comments disparaging them. Save your breath. Perhaps some people just don't find it funny to make fun of people. It's cheap humor."
1,Zip broke in one season,"Zip broke in one season, suggest spend some money and get better.Otherwise come next season you will buy another one of this China made junk"
1,So-so,"First of all, the title should already alarm you when it says ""M40"" and ""RIFLE"". It just screams ""PLEASE BUY MY PIECE OF CRAP I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT!"" Before i begin,i will remind you this is a ""MP40"" and it's actually a sub-machine gun (not a ""RIFLE""). What can i say but that this airsoft gun is very cheap. In a bad way! The plastic is cheap, it only shoots an average of 20 feet and the plastic snapped the first day i got it(not to mention it was damaged when i got it)So between the lazy, inaccurate name and the complete disregard for costumer satisfaction, i would give it a perfect NEGATIVE five, if i could. Even if you don't want to spend too much for a ""MP40"" airsoft gun, steer clear of the ""M40""!"
1,ITS NOT A GOOD WATCH!,"I bought this watch and knowing seiko 5 is a good brand. But all of the sudden after 3 times first is when i got the watch, second after 1 week and last one is just last night and that was after a week as will of reseting the time and date. The Crown was not good quality it was a lost thread or i spring or i don't know i just like i coudn't lock because the short and long arm was moving while i trying to lock the crown. So try a quality brand and good item."
1,What were they THINKING???,"This movie was SO boring. I immediately wanted to see it when I saw the preview, but found myself waiting for it to end when I finally did see it. You can tell when they're trying to have it be scary, and you just think ""What the heck?!! This isn't scary at all!"" My friend that went to the theatre with me hated it too. Don't waste your money on this. The acting and plot is terrible. But if you're too tempted and still want to see it, rent it first! PLEASE don't buy it! This was a waste of my time. Don't let it waste yours!!!"
1,sloppy,"Avoid this book. As historian William C. Davis has noted, the author knows so little about his subject that he put a picture of a Federal cavalryman on the cover...that's not Stonewall Jackson. For a solid biography of Jackson, see James I. Robertson's work on the subject."
1,Mortification From Libs Who Delude That Scheuer's Bipartisan,"It's time to head down to the Fuhrer Bunker, John Kerry. To sum up Bush's agenda, the United States should be declared a shining example of democratic excellence. Jeremy Jones is a complete, 100%, democracy hating nut. His projection of the conservatives' psychological condition actually applies to him. It is safe to say that he has serious problems, he is so out of touch with reality that he should be serving as one of Kerry's advisors."
1,Titles that look alike.,"The name Corbin Bernsen is pronounced, but this is the serei not the movie so he isn't in it.It's just boring."
1,Don't buy...,"All it is is a red lint brush that is self cleaning. If the red lint brushes work for you then so will this....otherwise keep your money. BTW, a red lint brush at the dollar store + your vaccuum cleaner would be even cheaper."
1,Too long,"It's just too long to drive home its point. The characters are one-dimensional, or not realistic. Granted it is a philosophical novel, it still is a novel, and the characters should have been made more believable. Too much repetition as well. I also don't understand what the big deal about objectivism is- haven't a lot of people before Ayn Rand been living their lives according to their own self-interest?"
1,"Boring, empty recital of binges, wrongs.","The book goes into a lot of binge and shame stories by Geneen and others in her workshops, with no hint of what brought her out of binge eating.This is a real waste of time, very boring."
1,Looking for the song played at Luke & Laura's wedding,"Does anyone remember the song played at Luke & Laura's wedding, thought it might have been a Kenny G song, but I just cannot seem to locate it."
1,Maddeningly uneven book.,"When I started reading this book I hoped it would be about centenarians and offer clues into their miraculous longevity, but instead the author's digressions are frustrating. Half way through the book and we realized much of the book is about the author, her marriage, and even a visit to her psychotherapist (!).0 Many paragraphs are like reading an on-the-road travelogue as the author describes scenery and environs to and from her interviews.Do we care? How is it relevenat to the secrets of centenarians?Important questions are virtually ignored: what's their spirituality/relligious beliefs? diet? excercise? etc. Instead the author asks innane and irrelevant questions such as ""What was the dust bowl like?"" as if there are not already written accounts found in any library? Maybe the author doesn't mind wasting time figuring she too will to 100, but I sure can't say that about myself. I don't like my time wasted."
1,I'm left wondering who really wrote the other reviews,"In an impulsive moment, I bought this book on the strength of its Amazon pairing with that other book about the pharmaceutical industry, and the five-star reviews. And only after reading it do I wonder how many of those reviewers might be associates of Dr. Kassirer himself. This is not a five-star book, folks; it is one long smear from beginning to end that seems to paint the entire medical profession with the same sticky, filthy brush. Yes, there is a fair amount of spice along the way--isn't that always true of ""exposes""?--but the whole seems much less than the sum of its parts. For my money, there isn't NEARLY enough hard data here to support the sorts of dour conclusions the author would have us accept on his say-so."
1,Mostly Instrumental - Boring,This CD is mostly instrumental songs and my son was bored of it easy. Make sure to listen to all the songs before you buy it. My son is a Thomas the train nut and the other CD's I have bought him with more songs about the trains and from the TV are more loved.
1,Not a good choice for my son...,"I loved this book until we got to the end... it just proved to my son that he should be able to sleep in my bed every night! He is entering a phase in which he's scared of everything at night, so I bought this for him to try to help get him past his new fears. I hoped that it would help him feel comfortable and safe in his own bed. I wish I had read through it myself before we read it together! The empathy that he feels for Little Mouse validates his concept that his bed is definitely not the place to be at night! It was a very sweet book, but a bit unpractical for parents with children who have nighttime fears."
1,Better instruction is out there....,"Sure, a few shots of France are nice, but this video was not helpfull. The students in this video have never played, watching them swing was of little use to me. If you are looking for ways to correct a slice or improve your short game, I am guessing you won't find your answer here. I regret purchasing this 20 year old video."
1,Not at all what I expected,"I had never eaten a Luna bar before I made this purchase, so I had expectations that were not even close to being fufilled.When I read ""chocolate Pecan Pie"" .. I expected just that.. the taste of rich chocolate, with nutty pecans and a gooey sugary base. What I received was a bar with little taste, nothing at all similar to the name on the bar.In my opinion, the bar is edible if you have no expectations of it... the flavor is barely there. The bar is dry. It is never again be on my ""purchase"" list"
1,slow reading,this book has a slow start and i am bored. there has been nothing exciting happen in the first 75 pages so I quit
1,Painstakingly boring.,"There are many movies that don't get made for a long time because people are afraid to take a financial risk on something different. There are other movies that maybe just shouldn't be made. This is the latter. I can't give it one star because it was well acted. The few people who recognize this title probably sought it out and are into a very niche sort of veiwer. They will like this because it is what it is. A bad Lifetime movie sort of offering but well acted and filmed. This movie just isn't compelling or funny or other. If Helen and the artists involved made it out of their own pocket and produced it as a labor of love, more power to them. They created what they were after and it is a work they can appreciate themselves. It doesn't matter what the world thinks."
1,No prayer for an album,"The worst Iron Maiden album in my opinion but there are a few fantastic tracks amongst the anguish. Tailgunner, Prayer, Run Silent., Mother Russia are all very good but the band lost its focus after the huge tours for all those years. Adrian had left and Bruce would also leave after Fear of the Dark. Still its a must to own for those tracks I mentioned above but clearly the guys were not entirely focused on this album."
1,Very disappointed,"I can't believe all the problems with feeding the paper. Glad (well not glad) to see I am not alone. I've tried every and anything to get my paper to feed. If I knew then what I know now, I would have returned the piece of junk. It's too late now."
1,Worked okay for a while...then it broke down.,"I actually liked this for a while and then about 3 months in, it stopped working, completely! Oh well, I learned my lesson but thank goodness I didn't spend too much for it."
1,It was sent as a gift per a request of recipient,"Our grandaughter requested the book as a birthday gift. She received it, and we have heard no complaints; so, we assume it was satisfactory."
1,Marginal reception,Offers only marginal reception in the Chicago area for DTV. Amplified versions of this type of antenna work better.
1,"Just say ""NO!""","I could not agree more with the others here. Paramount is trying to get rich quick off of this series. I had every intention of buying all 20 seasons of Gunsmoke, provided they were released one season at a time, maybe two seasons per year. That'd take me into my 60's. But at this rate, it could take more than 20 years to release the entire series. The same thing was done with other classic Westerns like ""Rawhide"". It may be time to consider the Gunsmoke Anniversary edition or other prior releases. Even better, online rentals!"
1,Indian Welk,"Although this may sound pleasant to some people I would imagine it's an insult to others. Just another example of the exploitation of the true Americans. It's like there was a Lawrance Welk of native American music only worse. An equivelant might be buying a Metallica cd and hearing Madonna music coming from the speakers. You expected something with some real spirit but you got watered down syrupy bubblegum music instead. It's not the real thing. Besides that I'm a professional drummer, and I'm definitly not impressed with the drumming. But having said that, if you just want some pop music to listen to and delude yourself that your listening to real native American music then this is for you.It would probably be better to rename it and put a different picture on the cover that would be less insulting to the people it's making a mockery of and more suitable to the disco minded crowd it's apparently trying to foster."
1,Failed Under Continuous Test,Tried this with Windows 8 and Windows XP. Tried with several different USB devices. Tried with drivers on the supplied CD and others downloaded from Belkin. All attempts failed to recognise the device attached to the USB switch. Will contact Belkin and see what they say. Not very promising....
1,Finally an Ash figure,"Now before I start, let me clear something up. I only gave it two ""fun"" stars, but this is truly a cool toy. It just wouldn't be any fun for anyone to play with. It is a statue, molded to mimic the famous pit scene from Army Of Darkness, and it will NOT be played with. Still, if you're a rabid Evil Dead fan, then this is a must. The accessories are really neato, and the little rubber Necronomicon prop is a toy all by itself, I kept finding myself with it in my hand, fiddling with it. My main gripes are that it doesn't look alot like Bruce Campbell, even though the prototypes looked flawless, and the shotgun holster kinda popped off. Oh well."
1,Sorry I bought this,"Good idea IF the product held up to use.The white strip with the measurements flaked off - what good is a measuring cup without measuring lines.The plastic is too thin and flimsy.A waste of money.If they come out with a glass one with measuring lines that are painted into the glass, I might consider it."
1,Longest Little Book,"This short little book took me AGES to get through. I constantly made excuses to do anything but read it and that is NEVER a good sign. Multiple sideline plots made it difficult to discern what message the author wanted readers to take with them at the close. The most prominent storyline was the murder of a little girl but the mystery is consistently overshadowed by complications in the life of the mother of the autistic witness to the crime. There are complications with her old girlfriend, with her old boyfriend, and with her present day loneliness. The trips down memory lane left me questioning the point of the novel. I am still not sure what the driving message was. The longer I contemplate it the more I think the murder was never the author's main point, but without that, frankly, I'm not sure what the main point is. Decidedly un-gripped by this tale."
1,Hmmm.,Commander X is like so right dude. One time after taking bong hits my dog told me to look out of the window and sure enough Brown people were floating outside in the air. The next morning I felt pretty groggy and later found out that our septic tank had exploded. Weird.
1,TERRIBLY DISAPPOINTED,"I have greatly enjoyed Anne of Green gables and Anne of Avonlea that I personally bought new VHS tapes for my friends to watch. I was overjoyed to see that a sequel had been made to Anne of Avonlea. I was however, terribly disappointed at how P.E.I. was no longer the main setting in the third movie. How could they have thoughtr of digressing from Montgomery's story? I think it was such an injustice!!!"
1,"Made In China, for sure.","Sounds like I got a better deal than many of these people. Mine worked for nearly a year until the shut off/on switch stopped working. It will either shut off every two seconds, or once it gets going it will not shut off by itself. Kinda seems like a fire hazard to me. Quality seemed okay, but it's obviously a disposable appliance, and I'm not interested in filling landfills with purchases, so I will be shopping for better quality with my next one."
1,What mist? This thing sucks!,"I was too embarrased to return this. The mist thing spits out some water at your face. They should call it ""the underpowered face vacuum that spits at your face for being an idiot and buying this machine""!"
1,Get a better editor,"This is the most disjointed story I have ever read by Martin Cruz Smith. Was his editor on vacation or just asleep? What's with the telephone call to Eva and the taped soccer match? Give me a break. When I read the sample on my kindle it sounded like a great intrigue. Once I had paid and downloaded the total book I realized the story was going absolutely nowhere.I am chagrined to think I suggested this to a friend, who downloaded it but decided not to finish it.I feel cheated. Not out of money but out of a good story."
1,Beware of the cheap plastic construction,Bought this at a local Walmart. The settings are very nice and it works fine but doesnt last long - cheap plastic parts start leaking at the connectors (which crack) and in addition the hose is made of plastic and is very stiff. Look for something else.
1,Tooooo soft no support...,"As the title said too soft no support, would probably be fine for someone weighing 100 lbs or less. But if you're over that squishes down to nothing."
1,Stupid 90% of the time. Best feature: Eva Mendes.,"You have to dive deep into suspension of disbelieve waters if you want to enjoy this thing. I believe Frank Miller wanted to issue this film at least R-rated instead of PG-13. Who knows? Perhaps studio executives insisted in a PG-13. Otherwise why blurring Eva Mendes nude (and sooo brief) scene? She is a goddess and I don't see anything wrong in worshipping her beauty. Besides, she's a very good actress. However, this is America and frontal nudity must be forbidden. Otherwise we may find it attractive and become perverted by the devil.In any case, at times the movie almost makes sense. The excessive violence of the fighting sequences may shock some people, until it's understood that the charcters really don't suffer that much.Acting is not bad, but something went wrong somewhere with the movie. It could have been good Frank Miller. Instead is awful Frank Miller."
1,"Great Idea, Poor Execution","In a nutshell, this book stinks. It's more about the trials and tribs of a 30-year-old in a dead-end job in New York than it is about Julia Child or cooking or food in general. And the whole book is larded with profanity which serves no purpose, except perhaps to bolster the author's hipster creds. But at the end of the read, where are we? Roughly the same place we started, except in need of a shower. Because of the book's great potential, I think it's fair to call the book a huge failure"
1,Didn't live up to the expectations,"I had had high hopes for this book but I was sorely disappointed.The storyline dragged like slow torture and the characters seemed barely two-dimensional.There was great potential in both the storyline and the characterization, however the author missed both marks by a long shot.So many times I wanted to just give up and put this one away but I kept reading thinking (hoping, wishing) it would get better. And it did, but only through fleeting passages. Then back to the same old labored reading.I gave this 2 stars instead of 1 because there were definite resolutions to the two main conflicts presented in the story. Had it not been for those much-sought-after resolutions, the whole thing would've been a complete waste of time.If you can hold out so long as to find out how the conflicts get resolved, then more power to you. If not, no big deal. You won't have missed much."
1,A Chore to Read,"Contrary to many of the reviews listed here (which influenced me to buy this book), I found it very tedious and difficult to read. It is so engrossed in the old English and ship terms that it's only value for me was as an academic exercise. Entertainment value: 1 out of 5, Technical Sailing terms: 5 out of 5, Readability: 1 out of 5. Recommendation: Select something more enjoyable to read."
1,not so great,"Says 5 to 10 hours, I'm lucky if it lasts 3 1/2 hours of use.Use it at school because there are no close outlets. With class lasting 4 + hours, I ended up bringing an extension cord.Also, very expensive. Not worth the price."
1,"Kiki's Delivery Service, Disney Studio Ghibli Film","Allow me first to comment that this movie in its original form is not what you get here. It has been edited. It has been changed. Some of the best parts have been removed.When our daughter was small we watched this movie on VHS over and over again. We know it forward and back. This movie became our daughter's favorite film ever. When the VHS gave out and the movie had broken we began a search for the DVD replacement. We found this. Bought it and waited till Christmas to give it to her.It was the biggest smile of the day when she opened this gift.BUT it was also the biggest let down of the day when she watched it.I cannot stress it strongly enough that a film like this should not be tampered with. But they did, now I am stuck with a DVD she hates and a movie that is not the original. It said the movie was the original. But that was a lie.Don't buy this if you know the original and expect it to be the same.We are not happy."
1,Had to return it for a refund,Brand new battery still in the package that would not run the camera nor would it accept a charge from the charger. its a good thing I still have an old battery that still works.
1,Crashes,"I read several reviews (unfortunately after my purchase) that talked about the program (version 4 mostly) crashing. We purchased version 5, you'd think it would be better....Nope. I have had this game for my daughter since October, and have never made it to Oregon. It will simply shut down in the middle of a game. I have un-installed and re-installed the game. It makes no difference. I have a new computer, and plenty of space, a fast processor, no reason why this simple game will not work properly. Very disappointed. I played this game when I was in school, and thought that my kids would enjoy it.I also agree with several people who think that the beginning purchasing is too compicated. It is confusing for ME, let alone a grade-schooler."
1,A video which discourages from visiting Canada's parks!,"This one-hour long video covers 21 famous Canadian National parks, but contains very little useful information and is certainly cannot be used for planning a trip to one of these parks. There is next to nothing about what to do in the parks or about the scenery which one can expect. The only message of the tape is that parks are refuges for wild animals. At least 40 minutes out of an hour you watch wolves, bears, birds, goats, and the like. I do not mind the animals, but there is much more to the parks than the wild life! Unfortunately, those few glimpses of scenery which made it into the video are so miserably filmed that the only conclusion one can make after watching this video is that Canadian National parks have absolutely nothing interesting or remarkable to offer. I have never seen a more misleading video than this one. Stay away from it."
1,WHY DO WE KEEP BUYING PILLS TO LOSE WEIGHT?,"I bought the HARDCORE, beacuse I wanted to keep some muscles in stead ""I GAINED 10 POUNDS AROUND MY WAIST"".The first day I took them I was more aware, had more energy. I was no shaky or jittery, so I thought it was good. Did not get hungry yet I knew I had to eat. By the third day I was already taking the 6 recommended pills and the results were: I was tired, moody, not motivated, I was eating more etc.It wasn't until I stopped taking this crap that people around me told me that I was acting different, not even HYPER but slow and rude. People stop taking pills that do not shrink, but your wallet."
1,Liberal Trash,A bunch of kooks from the Episcopal Church (church of Satan) sitting around casting beads attempting to tell you what Jesus REALLY said. The only thing this book is good for is to be used as fuel for a fire or toilet paper.
1,AWFUL,The only book this year that I couldn't finish. It just drags on and on. By page 150 you almost wish that the main character gets killed.
1,great show horrible deal!!!!!!!!,beleive me i love family guy i think its hilarious but what annoys me is that they are selling seasons by the half! look at it this way a show like the simpsons can cost any where between $20 msrp to $50 msrp depending on the season so lets say the average simpsons season costs $35 when i buy the simpsons which is in my mind equally as good as family guy i get 25 episodes for $35 but when i buy family guy im getting 13 episodes for $40 it just doesnt make sence to me they are just trying to rip us off it honestley is not fair at all id rather by the simpsons
1,Does NOT fit on my Mossberg 500,"The rear trigger pin fits perfectly but the two front holes in the mount itself are useless. Only one hole lines up with anything (the ejector screw), and this cannot be removed or the ejector mechanism will fail. I even contacted Mossberg and they said that the product is faulty and shouldn't be used without smithing.Further more, if you do feel like using the ejector screw port for the front of the mount, the more you tighten the screw the further in it pulls the mount - COMPLETELY misaligning the mount as a suitable point for any kind of optic.Plain and simple, this mount doesn't work without proper gun smithing. I am now using a zip-tie to hold down the front of the mount until I have it properly smithed. I don't give many bad reviews on Amazon, but this is one of them..."
1,Not with this name for sure.,Do this company think that a title as such will convince a serious listener?Not really... I Hope.Try again please. This name is just ugly.
1,...,"... reading all of Acclaim's hype and being disappointed. One 9 inning game contains about 30 strikeouts, takes over an hour to finish and is horribly loaded with glitches. When the runners steal, the player misses the tag each time, but the player is still out, it doesnt even look close, and I have seen Sega Genseis baseball games more graphically pleasing. The bells and whistles are great, if u want to SIM thorugh seasons and be a GM for [money] , but if u like to buy baseball games to actually play the baseball then please do not buy All Star, go for High Heat!!"
1,Gross,"Like it says. Gross food made with gross ingredients, aimed at an eighth grade audience. Not even one thing I would make with or for my grandchildren."
1,not a nice man. not a great writer either.,"So Peter Trachtenberg has alienated his parents, his friends, most of the women he's been involved with -- everyone except his tattooist (maybe because she's gay). He is a profoundly self-indulgent man. A few shocking ""thrills"" here, but that's about it."
1,Ineffective,"This product was a complete disappointment. It did not effectively straighten my hammer toe, and it came off my toes after walking around the house for a few minutes."
1,Amazon Drops the Ball,"I contacted Amazon that this product didn't work well (noisy, disconnects, etc) and that I would like to return it. I received an email that said the unit would be replace so that I could try it again on April 17th, but I haven't seen it yet, a month later."
1,"Boring, mis-directed and a realy snoozer","I've read thousands of wonderful fiction books in my life and this has to be one of the worst ever! The book just drags on and on -- I kept reading, hoping that I would come upon a good part, but never did. Don't waste your time."
1,Not well made,"The bill of this hat was attached haphazardly and was noticeably askew; It's parabola ""pointed"" to one side. After a cursive inquiry put to the manufacturer, I gave up on returning it for replacement. After some thought, I concluded only grizzled pipe-smoking sea-dogs can swing this hat, so it was not worth the pursuit."
1,Do not buy dated material from this vendor,Product was out of date (expired) By the time I realized this it was too late to return.After spending a hour on the phone with hp help. The solution was to get a new cartrage the was not expired!!Had to toss. A complete waste of money.Do NOT buy dated material from this vendor!!
1,Great but died after a year,"I loved this juicer and used it just about every day. It's very solidly build and extracts juice quite well. However, after about a year exactly, it died on me and no longer spins. There is apparently a defect with the plastic piece on the base that turns the citrus part. I'm waiting to hear back from Breville about repair or replacement but all of the reviews on the Breville site say the same thing and also note that it's expensive to mail and replace. I can believe that because the unit itself is pretty bulky."
1,"I would give it no stars, but that isn't an option.","If you are going to buy the video, you are presumeably doing it for one of three reasons. For each, I have advice:(1) Reason for purchase: You missed it on the big screen. Advice: Don't bother. This is an awful film, and even worse for all of the hype.(2) Reason: Buying it as a present. Advice: Flowers or a book would be nicer. If you have to buy a *video*, try *Good Will Hunting* (dir: van Sant) or *Rainmaker* (Coppola).(3) Reason: You watched it a dozen times on the big screen and now can't wait to own it. Advice: Sorry, I cannot help you."
1,way off pitch,"Forgive me for being a purist but when you advertise that a tuning fork has is c256, you should deliver one that is c256, whether the buyer intends to use it medically, musically, or as a doorstop! I suggest that the seller advertise the merchandise as ""somewhere in the approximate neighborhood of c256"". That would at least be honest."
1,Avoid this mower,"This lawn mower broke on me before I had even used for ONE season. I used it for about two months before it stopped running.I even cleaned out the carbourator and gas lines and tank,but to no avail. You get what you pay for I guess. Do NOT buy this mower. Spend the money to get something that lasts."
1,I have a problem,The set up is wonderful. Love the look. The radio works fine. My problem is that most of the CD's I try to play skip. To correct this problem I have to lay it on its back. So...I am here at Amazon shopping for another type unit.
1,"Rushed, fumbled and crippled.","This is a mediocre phone, made nearly useless by Verizon.PROS:- Great speakerphone- Very slim and pretty- The phone part of the KRZR, is decent.CONS:- Menu is not intuitive and has a very long lag between different menu screens- Takes forever to start up the text message screen- Almost 15 seconds and 6 clicks to open up your MP3 player.- MP3 player unusable because it's very tricky to get MP3s on the phone and there's no headphone jack. The USB-to-2.5mm adapter that comes with the phone is pointless since all headphones are 3.5mm.- Battery dies in a year, so be ready to purchase at least one more if you're like me and have a 2-year contract- Verizon disables almost all bluetooth profiles...no free pictures, ringtones, games, videos or internet.- The mobile internet is obsolete. You pay 5 bucks a month to access tiny WAP portal loaded with Verizon ads.I will never get another MOTO phone and I'm leaving Verizon right after my contract is up. Bring on the iPhone."
1,CLOSER,DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE. I KEPT WAITING FOR IT TOGET BETTER.JULIA ROBERTS SHOULD BE ASHAMED TO HAVE HER NAMEATTACHED TO IT.IT WAS ONE OF THE WORST I'VE EVER SEEN.
1,The tests are in!,"I've been taking this product for the past 6 months. I cut out a large portion of cheese, ice cream, and eggs from my diet. I was taking 2 pills of Policosanol a day and my total cholesterol went from 243 to 267. My HDL (good cholesterol) went down a smidge, but my LDL (bad cholesterol) shot up. I don't think the Policosanol had anything to do with the increase, but it sure didn't lower it at all. The only thing that went down was the balance in my bank account. Your results may vary, but do yourself (and your bank account) a favor and get a blood test relatively soon to see if it is working for you. It sure didn't for me and I'm sorry I didn't get it checked sooner to stop my subscription."
1,Honest Opinion,"I thought there was a lot of repetition concerning Zack Walker. This was the only book of Linwood Barclay that I found boring. I love all the rest of his novels. Once I start reading them I can't put them down. I was disappointed with this novel, but I realize it was his first. I could figure out the plot as soon as I started reading this book."
1,Terrible ick,"Horribly pretentious film. Main character (Hathaway) is supposed to be sympathetic, but at the end of this film she becomes off-putting. Do not see this film unless you like terrible teen junk."
1,Overly complicated,"I'm afraid I have to agree with the other reviewers. I had such high hopes of getting a true insight into how a large enterprise scale application is made in the real world.Sadly, I was totally lost after the first 50 pages and found the rest of the book far to much effort to continue with.These guys are obviously very clever, but they sorely need to look at some of the classic books such as the Gang of Four or Martin Fowlers book to get an idea of how to make difficult topics readable"
1,A useless mask,"When I read the title, I thought finally something refreshing as are only Eastern philosophies. It was not. The interjection of biblical elements detracted from the approach I was expecting, thereby making it a sham on so many levels. It is Christian trying to dress up as Zen, and it doesn't work."
1,Too small and poorly designed,"The XXL socks were too small for my size 12 foot - I could not get my foot all the way in them. The tops were also flared and loose: had I been able to get my foot in them, I'm guessing they would have sagged.I would not recommend these to anyone."
1,Obsolete Technology with No Access,"Although this is described as Mac compatible, this application requires OS9 which is not well supported by Apple anymore. Trying it on Windows produced mediocre results. Don't waste your money on this! Even when running, it is not effective."
1,The cover is the best part...,"All right, maybe I'm misjudging it. The CD is entertaining. This isn't a revolutionary tome written by a techno-visionary inventor, it's more a nice little pamphlet introducing people to Our Friend, Mr. Computer. Having read it 4 years ago, I found it just as vapid as Donald Trump's Art of the Deal: you find the same self-congratulation packaged as wisdom, but since Trump never claimed to be doing anything new, it's even worse. You get a techno-primer on such things as the binary system, a cute picture of a boy Gates fooling with a PDP-8, a lot of talk about his way-kewl house, and a CD-ROM showing off what life is going to be like in a Windows-centric future. Rereading it, it's amazing how much this ""visionary"" got wrong: stick to bridge, Bill, you're better off."
1,Not an American book,"I ordered this book last week in hopes of learning Marquetry. Well, little did I know that this book wasn`t written by an American in plain English, it is written by 2 Englishmen who reference things we are not familiar with in this country.. If you know your millimeters, centimeters and metrics you will be fine with the measurements.....but this book doesn`t even tell you that PVA glue is the old school Elmers glue. Another thing is the vagueness in which they teach......""keep the knife 2 degrees to the vertical""....which probably means tilt it 2 degrees. Oh, and the biggest complaint.....this book is about making furniture and what not.....why couldn`t the whole book be about teaching just Marquetry?? ....anyway, I`m sorry I bought this."
1,No wonder it's so cheap,"This book is FULL of errors and pronounciation mistakes.They have Arigatou phonetically spelled - Arry-gattaw.In Japanese, A is always Ah, O is always Oh, U is OO (except when silent), E is always Eh, I is EE (except when silent). and there is no set 'R' sound in japanese, so it sounds like a cross between an English L or English D.So Arigatou should be - Ah-lee-gah-toeThey have Sou desu ne phonetically spelled Saw-dess-nair. (Where's the R in ne?)It should be So Dess Neh.This is the WORST book to get if you are traveling to Japan. AVOID AVOID AVOID AVOID AVOID. It's not even worth $5!!"
1,Disappointed,"This book went no where. It took me 4 months to finish because I kept putting it down in favor of more interesting books(like my dish washer manual). If its content were edited to half the number pages and a small climax and partial conclusion were added, the book would have been much more enjoyable. I don't consider the encounter at the end a climax. It seems like it was just pasted in. I won't buy book 10 unless it's the conclusion, and that's only because I've invested so much time already."
1,B-17 Flying Fortress Worthless Garbage,"I feel the need to warn other people out there not to waste their hard earned money on this worthless game. I just purchased a copy of this game and it will not run on my computer even though my system meets or exceeds the manufacturers recommended system requirements. Also there is no tech support for this product so I guess if you are having difficulties with this product, that's just too bad. Tech support is only open from 12 pm to 5 pm Mon. thru Fri. any other times you are just out of luck. Plus the fact that you have to pay long distance charges to get a game running that should have been running in the first place. THANKS MICROPROSE AND HASBRO for such a lovely game. Micrprose delayed this game for 5 months you think that they could have done a better job."
1,"Sorry, Didn't Work for Me","This product may work for some people, but our (2) little rats are either very intelligent, or they don't care. We have been trying to catch them since November (of '07), with 3 different types of traps in two sizes. This was the latest attempt.I swear, at night, I can hear them singing, ""I'm al-right....""Karen S."
1,Irish Tenors are Better,"I accidentally bought this CD because I thought it was ""The Irish Tenors"". I wish that I had bought theirs. The ballads in this CD are hollow, the music is lacking, and their voices lack conviction. ""Live From Belfast"", by the Irish Tenors, has these same songs in a deeper, truer tenor and I much prefer it. However, I give these guys props for having the guts to record an album, albeit a bad one."
1,Review,"Seems to work about the same as most other homeopathic gas relievers, multiple doses are generally necessary. The reason for the 2 stars is because the taste is foul. Really, if you have a weak stomach or very senstive to flavors I don't recommend it. I keep mints around and pop one at the same time."
1,Don't buy this phone.,This phone is the biggest piece of junk I have ever purchased. We purchased three of these phones and all 3 have been replaced. You cannot hear anything unless you use speakerphone. It also just turns off while you using it. Please take my advise and don't waste your money.
1,Ball does not stay inflated,This ball needs to be inflated every few hours....the ball is a little small. Would never buy this ball again.
1,U haven't shipped it to review it!!,"In wouuld be happy to review this item but since I ordered this on July 4th, 2006 but you still have not shipped the game. When are you going to ship it??? If I go to reorder it, it says 2 weeks for delivery. Since you don't seem to be able to get this item why does it still say 2 weeks for delivery since by now you know this item is not available."
1,Product didn't arrive,"The product didn't arrive. I bought it in september 22, destination santiago - chile. There's no tracking number and I'm supposing it wont arrive... bad luck for me."
1,A Poor Adaptation,"I've seen many films in nearly all genres over the years. Rarely do I stop watching before the end of a film. This is one of those rare films that I found very poorly acted, despite the stellar cast. I don't know whether the director or screenwriter deserves the most blame for this lackluster story. This film does a grave disservice to Isabel Allende's book. Watch this at your own risk."
1,Don't do it not what you think,"Deep inside of all of us there is something that says, I want my electronics protected from hammers or the occasional fall into the fire. Let me warn you my camping friends this is not the product you expect. The toughskin is a rubber overlay, much like any of the ones you can purchase with an arm band.Though it does help cover the product it is not what it appears to be. it is not hard plastic or thick strong rubber.You are better off with the basic skin.Sorry speck people, I've bought two for gifts and not only was I not satisfied, neither were the other recepients."
1,Every one strikes out once in a while!,"There is no BIGGER Sting fan than me. If I there is any artist who could put out great albums every single time, it's Sting. Let's face it - Every album since the Police has been amazing, including the Soul Cages which was not exactly commercially oriented or the best selling album. This album, however, is just blah. The music is all over the place and nothing sticks out. I think this is Sting's ""Emotional Rescue""! Hopefully he will be back up to par for the next one. Also there are only 9 songs on this album, not ten. That was disappointing because I always thought Sting had a lot of integrity. Even Alanis Morrisette gave us an extra song on ""Jagged Little Pill""!"
1,"Not the greatest software, but better than others","Easy to use for planning layouts but it is a bit buggy. There are several known bugs and the publisher has yet to address them with any kind of update.For simple layouts, this program is fairly intuitive, but for more complex items, there is quite a bit of a learning curve."
1,"Good premise, but....","Based on the premise of this movie, I thought that I would enjoy it. But I found myself continuing to watch simply to find out how the movie ended. Although Gwyneth Paltrow received glowing reviews for this performance, and is doing what I'm sure is a wonderful acting job, the character she plays (Catherine) was so irritating to me that I found it difficult to watch. I didn't feel sympathy for her, as I should have, and I couldn't see how Hal could be attracted to her. Perhaps part of this was due to the mechanism of jumping back and forth in time--maybe I couldn't get a complete picture of who Catherine was. I only saw her as self-absorbed, foul-mouthed and ready to spurn any kindness offered her. She appeared to be more of an adolescent--in her behavior and her way of whining when she spoke--than a 27 year old. Also, I wanted more of the intrigue of those who have a passion for math, but that was missing in this film."
1,What kind of plot is this??,"I have enjoyed all of Clancy's books. And while Rainbow Six is not necessarily a bad read, it has some very lame aspects to it. The plot is so far fetched and downright offensive toward environemtalists it scares me. Also, Clancy's writing is incredibly repetitive at times. He uses the word ""niggardly"" 3 times in 20 pages. And he uses the analogy ""as regularly as he zips up his pants"" a couple of times. What the hell kind of writing is this? I was laughing at how bad some of the writing was. But on a side note some of the action sequences are cool, but again it kind of wears old after 700 pages. I wish Clancy would stop trying to showcase his extrememly conservative views through his novels. Tom, this is your readers here, WE DON'T CARE. You may be a good writer, but as a person you seem to be a total jerk. Get back to your old self and keep it real next time."
1,Only 12 ounces,I already wrote a review for this item saying that the measurement on it is not what the picture shows and it leaks. I then got a rude e mail from the company because I left a low review. I DO NOT RECOMMEND buying anything from this company.
1,Not so much out on a limb as clutching at straws.,Not so much 'Out On A Limb' as 'Clutching At Straws'. Enough said!
1,BAD BAD BAD,"I have Jagged Little Pill and I love it, but this cd is too out there for Alanis, she can do so much better. She's getting pretty wierd on us. I think I'll just wait for her next cd to see if she is back to herself."
1,Couldn't Wait for it to End,"Many readers on various book sites would tell me, ""you've gotta read the Kidd series by Sandford."" This was the first that I read and it was a bit of a snore. This Kidd individual seems pretty shallow as his character has no depth or reality to it. LuEllen was a more interesting person than Kidd and maybe it would have been better if the story centered on her. Don't waste your time with this one. Sandford should stick with his ""Prey"" series."
1,Like Fingernails On a Chalkboard,"Cringe-worthy, especially watching Michael Caine explain a ""camel toe"". And what's funny about getting a slurpee thown out a car window at Nicolas Cage's weatherman? The word ""slurpee""? I was watching while on a treadmill to pass the time and boy did that 2 miles drag. I didn't bother to finish watching the movie, 30 minutes was more than enough punishment."
1,Not,Did not work on my 2006 colorado Crew cab. just the bumps on the highway and the truck woud bottom out.
1,Strangers,"I am big mystery/suspense reader and Strangers does not rank up there with any of my favorites. This book, to put it simply was just okay! The version a that I read was 526 pages long and I found that to be entirely too long (how others read versinons between 800 and six-hundred-and-some pages and still gave this book five stars I don't know)! The story could have been told very well in about 400 pages and would have gotten a much better review from me, however, I felt that much of the 526 pages was just fluff that unnecessarily filled up space. My other problem with this book was the ending which was totally predictable (let me just say, without giving away the ending, what you think it is, it is). Strangers was not a horrible book but I expected so much more from it as well as from Koontz which is why I can only give it 2 1/2 stars (there is no 1/2 option so I can really only give it 2)."
1,James Bond on Speed,"Skip this one, unless your attention span is less than 10 seconds, which is about the longest cut in the film. It really is like watching two hours of the shower scene in the original Psycho movie. I feel sorry for the cast which do a really good job, but their talents are cut short by the directors' apparent lack of confidence in their abilities as demonstrated by his over dependence on the edior who cut and pastes the film together out of short three to five second long takes. It took me a long time to get interested in the film after its weak opening scenes only to lose that interest again mid way through because of the relentless kaleidoscopic effect of the editing."
1,King of Trash,I can't believe how people is so stupid and eager to call this music.Elvis is one of the worst singers i've ever heard.He can't sing for rat's s***.His music is even worse.Elvis is a joke artist
1,I'm Being Nice with the 2 Stars!!!,"I'm watching this movie now and within 5 minutes into the movie. I am ready to turn this corny, ill-written, and badly produced movie out the window. The acting is pretty horrible as well.But ST3 is better then ST2."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF GARBAGE,"I see a lot of previous reviews from other people who got sucked into this product. It's the biggest waste of $30 I have ever spent. It leaks, sprays water all over my kitchen, and if I, heaven forbid, turn the water on past low, it will just fall off. I know the initial assumption is ""operator error"", but I assure you, as an engineer who works for a consumer products company, I have installed the thing correctly. I have the most standard faucet you could find, and it leaks everywhere. When I contacted Brita about the poor quality of their product, they ignored me and never responded. And you better hope you never have to move. I am moving right now, and the little plastic adapter literally disintegrated in the faucet head and is stuck there. When I tried to remove it, the plastic just kept snapping off until now it is embedded into the faucet, which will probably now need to be replaced because of it. DO NOT BUY BRITA and DO NOT BOTHER WITH THIS PRODUCT!"
1,Couldn't hold my 70# lab,"Had for one day, my lab tore down, yes she has SA but really thought it would hold up. Second time she figured out how to move the rails out of the way-bummer!!! We now secured to bar, head rests and anything else we could with zip lines-has held once so far"
1,Bad plastic formulation or something - prone to cracks,"You can see from the other reviews that this product is prone to cracks and OXO's warranty requires you to ship the item back making it a basically worthless warranty.My spout cracked clean in half. Guess pouring water out of it was too much. It actually shattered. I've never seen anything except really rigid plastic do that, not the type this can is made out of."
1,Not worth the time,"I've generally enjoyed her other works, with their often obsessive and creepy themes, but this one didn't do anything for me at all. A very odd story, with very odd and unpleasant characters. I pushed myself about half-way through, hoping for it to get interesting; instead it just got wierder and wierder. I didn't care how it came out, and quit reading it."
1,junk!!!! warning!!!!!,"It was almost too good to be true. Purchased from retailer(major retailer) who couldnt supply parts for it. Subsequently, retailer ceased selling it. PARTS ARE IMPOSSIBLE TO GET. Simply, the cutting blades eventually get dull and wear out. They are unavailable in the U.S. AND HAVE BEEN FOR AT LEAST TWO OR MORE YEARS. McCulloch now owned maybe by Huskvarna but who knows for certain. Parts available only through Parts Tree. Obtained from overseas. The machine is an incredible machine for the price and for what it does, And is ELECTRIC which makes it quiet, and not generating of local pollution but the fact that there is/ has been NO SUPPORT for the machine which makes it a piece of crap. You cant give it away because the idiot who takes it is also stuck with out being able to get parts for it. SO SAD!!!!!"
1,"one star, but for only one reason....","I give it one star for only ONE reason, it doesn't work on my blu ray player. I live in Australia and have had problems only with FOX blu rays... till now.I'm guessing disney have now begun coding the blu rays too. Either way, it doesn't work on my player, unfortunately... I LOVE THIS FILM!!!"
1,Not worth the paper it's written on,"This book is a complete fabrication. Buyer beware! The only reason why this book was written has to do with the vendetta that some vets have against Kerry. Some feel that he 'sold them out' when he testified against the Vietnam War upon his return. In truth, they could not stand to see themselves be called baby killers. Worse, they are ungateful since they cannot thank him for an early end to that war. Instead, the writer of this book created a myth in order to retaliate against Kerry's testimony of the early 1970's. The real truth is that at the same time that Kerry was practicing his constitutional right to free speech, Bush was shoving white junk up his nose with the silver spoon that hangs from his neck."
1,scratched,This was the first time I have ever bought a book on CD. I usually just check them out from the library. The CD's look brand new but the story skips quite a bit. I will not buy a book on CD again. I will buy the regular book because I heard the book itself was fantastic.
1,Unsolved disappearances in the Smokey mountains,Book was in ok condition. Boring read though. The stories were told then updated then updated again I wouldn't re-read.
1,They should have stopped at Testimony of the Ancients,"Yeah, yeah its technical. TOO BAD THE MUSIC JUST DOES NOT CUT IT. It seems like some metal bands lost their direction beginning around 1994. If you want to hear Pestilence, go listen to Consuming Impulse or Testimony of the Ancients. I understand that a band wants to experiment, but I sure am glad this was their last album if this was the direction they were going. I am being nice giving this album 2 stars.Personal Energy is one of the worst songs. Take me back Reduced to Ashes !!!!!!!!"
1,"Heavy, but nowhere near as good as their first","The firt superjoint ritual album (use once and destroy) is much better then this one. Every song on this album starts out differently and then ties into the same guitar riffs. It sounds like every song could blend into each other and create just one song. There are only two songs really worth listening to, waiting for the turning point and dress like a target.Don't be fooled because of Phil as the vocalist, this is his worst product easily.Get any Pantera album instead of this, or any down album or use once and destroy, that is a fun one to listen to."
1,Worked well and then broke after three uses,"This dehydrator worked very well. We (me and my mother) were quite pleased with it. After three uses, however, we plugged it in and it simply didn't turn on. It just simply didn't work anymore.I read other reviews of this specific dehydrator that say the same thing. I wish I read the reviews before I bought this dehydrator."
1,This book didn't do a thing for me...........waste of money!,"This book is not what it claims to be. It's just a lot of addresses, etc. Didn't do anything for me except waste my time and money. Don't bother with it is my advice."
1,...,This is by FAR the worst Metallica record to date. They have gone downhill ever since the black album. I am sorry to say that I don't think I've heard a worse rock/metal album in quite some time. Too bad coming from one of the best metal bands of all time (in its hayday).
1,Anesthesia for the gifted,"I checked this book out of the public library in hopes of gaining some insight into the many kinds of difficulties an adult faces upon learning of his/her giftedness. Instead, this book was full of Oprah-like perky advice, sprinkled liberally with sleep-inducing anecdotes about ""Heather"" and ""James"" et cetera.The author does not have the gifted reader in mind with this book. It is overstuffed with fluff and not enough substance. I have yet to find a book on gifted adults that speaks to us at our own level of intellect and cogently outlines issues and strategies that we face with our unique brains."
1,I hate this thing!,"Shoulda bought the Britax...probably will still...The straps are the worst part on this thing. They are so hard to work with and the crank to loosen them about breaks your fingers off.Yes, Consumer Reports likes this for safety - but it's a nightmare to use!"
1,mostly .. a joke,watch it for yourself and you'll know.It will either make you angry for misrepresentation (straw man arguments)...or...happy and glad to confirm your misunderstanding of a subject.good propaganda tool. Not very good as far as documentary goes.Whether you'll like it or not depends solely on your already existing presuppositions and assumptions.I'd give it 1.5 stars for the filming and editing skills. that's it.(I predict this film to be popular due to successful brainwashing of a public. Such films only confirm to what particular masses were indoctrinated)
1,not the soundtrack of the movie!,"I bought this CD expecting the soundtrack of the actual movie. (Crazy idea, I know.) Isn't that what a soundtrack is? This is not the movie soundtrack.And I am furious and disappointed that it is not what it says it is."
1,Lowest common denominator,"Slow moving because of simplistic plot and irrelevant libido of main character. Boring story line - reads like a cheap screenplay for a bad sitcom. Main character has unimaginative sex at least once a chapter - too bad these sex acts add nothing to character development or progression of the story as they ostensibly could have(a stretch), afforded the right artistic talent. Predictable in an unsatisfying way. Unoriginal. Kept reading, despite - hoped to find a fabulous twist to the ending, to great disappointment. This book goes straight into the recycling/trash bin. I wouldn't want anyone else in the world to waste their time reading it. Sorry, Delacorta, try again."
1,D-Link Wireless Access Point,"The item would not work for me, even after spending a lot of time with a Tech. from the Company and my own ISP provider. It did light up, but that's about all.The Seller would not accept it back claiming there is nothing wrong with it. I find this to be very poor customer service and will never buy from them again.Beware of this Seller."
2,"why has'nt ""Metro"" caught on like AbFab and the UK QAF yet?","I am a fan of Ab Fab and the UK QAF and puzzled why ""MetroSexuality"" hasnt gotten its respect in the US yet? It's large cast and fast paceness got my dizzying and wanting more. A segment involving ""Dean's"" parents was a tad bothersome but I overlooked that informaltiy. I do look foward into seeing more Metro though."
2,My go-to portrait lens!,"Really nice sharp tight crop lens that compresses and blurs the background nicely. I can't say enough about it, it makes everyone I shoot look amazing!. =)"
2,Tough.,"Tough, Tough, Tough. This program is not for the faint of heart. I am a pretty fit guy and this program taxes me every time. It really takes a lot of commitment and a lot of real effort. If you aren't serious about losing weight or getting fit then don't add this to your DVD collection for the shelf."
2,Too Good To Be True!!,"If you want a great book, this is the book for you. I couldn't put it down at all. The story was excellent, and could easily have been mistaken for a true story. The characters were well developed, and this would make an great blockbuster film."
2,"Nice product, even if you have to work a bit to get it working.","I had the same issue with my dispenser that other people seemingly have had. Open the box, fill it with liquor and nothing comes out. Thanks to Franks suggestion, I opened up the ""nozzle"". Anyone who has the same problem and some basic skills should be able to get this working great. The problem is that the nozzel works by phsically crimping a plastic tube, but while the product sits around on the shelf, the tube ends up sticking shut. To fix, use a sharp screwdrive to gently prying off the top cap, the front and rear rings. Once these are removed, pry open the nozzle casing. You may have to use two screwdrivers and it may feel like there is something else holding it together, but it's really just the two rings and the top cap. Once open, you will see the tube crimped. As Frank says, remove the tube and massage it until it opens. Put it all back together the same way it came apart and enjoy this neat product."
2,A BETTER MOUSETRAP,This is a handy little product. I caught TWO mice in one trap the first night.. no bait used. I live in the country.. and try to keep mice outside.. they have a tendency to want to go under the house.. so am using these around the base outside. They have proven to catch well.. though you do want to check them regularly.. I caught a frog one day too.. and released him into the pond!Quality of these traps is great. They appear sturdy and should last for a long time. Super easy to use.. just place them against a wall and they will catch! Easy to check the traps with the window on top. Super happy with this product!I am now ordering FIVE more of these for our outbuildings. They have done a great job of catching mice around the house..
2,biofreeze is great,My wife swears by bio freeze. Bad knees and this product seems to help a lot. Bought from a DR. and spent 20.00 from amazon 8.00 dollars.
2,NICE WORK!!!,I LOVE IT.THE SONGS ARE FUN AND UPLIFTING.ESPECIALLY THE TITLE TRACK THE MESSAGE IS PRECIOUS.I ALSO LOVE ''OBSSESION'' ''MAMA''AND ''THE PLEDGE''.
2,A success and inspirational work,"This movie is a must see! I disagree on how it was a struggle to itsexpectation. If you understand the movie from your heart instead of themind, it's very inspirational. It definitely inspired me and it shouldinspire everyone out there. It brought tears to my eyes when a struggleand wound that seems eternally damaged was still able to heal. If youmiss your chance to watch this movie in theater, don't miss it withthis DVD. Great job to all the cast and crew that made this filmpossible! Keep up the good work!"
2,great experiance,"very nice picture and price was reasonable.i'm very happy with this purchase.set up was really easy,although shipping was slow when it was only a three and a half hour drive away.no problems,over a month now.i'll shop here again."
2,"One of the Most Etheral, beautiful American films","This is the best version of the currently available, Nestor Almondres,'s cinematogrphic works are always a little grainy. The Print is reasonably clean with a few dots and scratches here and there, but mostly the beauty comes out well. Just one thing the Golden Colours are a bit more subdued than they are at the Theatrical showings of this particular film...."
2,Must read for those interested in History of Christianity,"Honest and forthright this second in a series of 6 presents clearly and accurately the history of the Christian Church post Constantine to approximately 1000ad. The weaving of secular and Christian history presents a rich tapestry to often ignored by those that focus on one side or another. Blanced, fair and honest look at the Church warts and all."
2,grat movie,"there is a really good version of this on dvd from tai seng. I don't think that I reviewed the right one so make sure you get the tai seng version. So this is your standard kung fu spectacle from joseph kuo and he brings along ALL of his masters. The only bad part about this movie is the LONG middle section and the kuo style cuts that ruined the fights, not completely, but with the action going on, this should have been an EASY 5/5."
2,Great buy product,Verry good drum pad has great bounce i recommend for anyone who is a Dummer of any kind at a very low price
2,Impressed,I've only had this drill press for 2 to 3 weeks. So far I am well pleased with it. I believe it's well worth the money. Assembly takes no time and the instruction are easy to read. I am so impressed with it that I don't believe a more expensive model would impress any more. It was good buy!! I only wish that I would have purchased it sooner. I also had great service from Amazon. THanks!!
2,A book I will give to my women friends...,"This is a lovely book. I don't give that praise easily...and by giving it, I mean that the novel is well crafted with expressive prose and finely drawn characters. It has a depth of meaning not only in its action, but in the allegorical depth suggested through the imagery which forms an intricate substructure. ""The secret life"" speaks of motherhood, womanhood, love, discovery, and personal strength. It provides wisdom to women, and pride, and beauty. And, it's a compelling story. I will give it as a gift to the people I care about."
2,Plane buffs listen up,All the new 3d smart tvs do a great job on producing high resolution pictures. This is a great 3d video that looks good on these new tvs.
2,An essential book for all artists and crafters,"Sure, it is called Rubber Stamped Jewelry, but it is more than that! This must-have book shows a wide range of techniques with well written instructions. Photographs give you a clear understanding of working with wire, rubber stamps, polymer clay, fibers, and more.You will be inspired to create several of these projects for yourself, for gifts, and for embellishments for other work. The projects are easy enough for beginners and creative enough for the advanced.I am glad that I have this book and it will make a great gift as well!"
2,Works with bluetooth on my Palm Tungsten E2,"This dongle works great, using only my Palm with Bluefish RX software. No complaints except one, and hopefully this will help some buyers.To initially set up your handheld device, when it asks for a passkey, which is a kind of password,THE PASSKEY IS ""belkin"" (all lower case).I would give this dongle five stars, except the passkey was no where in the manual or other literature that came with the product. I guessed it correctly after many tries and google searches. Now you can set it up without the hassle I had, and you can give it five stars, too."
2,Innacurate Examples,"Don't get me wrong, this book covers Microwave Engineering in great detail and covers all important topics in the field but be warned! There are many mistakes in his examples which often makes it tricky to follow the design steps. As long as you remember this, you'll be fine."
2,Knocks numetal on it's ass!,"The solos are sweet, Megadeth has Chris Poland in the band again, this album is really heavy, the songs of politcal turmoil are awesome, the riff in track 3 is cool, the vocals have emotions and angst, plus the song writing is great. Those are some of the many reasons to buy this album. There are many more, to many to list actually. so enjoy."
2,Connecting to God by Abner Weiss,"Connecting to God is without a doubt one of the most incredible books I have ever read. I urge everyone to buy a copy. If you want to discover the meaning of Kabballah and at the same time understand how it affects your psychological make-up, then you cannot afford not to read this incredible work by Rabbi Abner Weiss."
2,THIS IS A WONDERFUL AS THE SHOW IS,"I really love the show plus the magazine as well. I really glad I started to watch This Old House again after 5 years. Plus, I hope I get all of my issues of my subscription. I'm not a do it you selfer, I just subscribe to this magazine for getting ideas about my own place when I grow up. I emailed the editor to about my they should expand this magazine to other countries to show how their countries, I mean houses and so on. Sorry for my grammar. Thank you."
2,Off Lantern WORKS,"I researched products we could use without spraying DEET on ourselves. We camped in the forest in Northern Arizona. I saw the mosquitos move in around sundown. I used this OFF Lantern along with ""Avon Bug Guard"" from an AVON store on 7th and Bell in Phoenix. I couldn't smell the lantern. Maybe 1 bite per/person. Very Pleased."
2,Not the Book just Notes and Outline of the Book.,"I actually ordered this by mistake. I wanted the actual book. However, I was pleasantly surprised with the well written outline and summary."
2,Awesome collection for a Sopranos follower,"If you've followed the series, and felt a compelling association with the characters and their charisma, you'll relive that joy and connection with the songs in this collection."
2,Who's Really Afraid,"Sort of a mini-best-of, featuring AoN's one album for the ZTT label (WHO'S AFRAID OF) and other choice cuts from 12"" singles and their mini-LP INTO BATTLE. The extra tracks make for a great listen. Three versions of Moments of Love is one too many - I'd ditch the first or second, 'cause ""Three Fingers"" is excellent. Even my mom likes this album, so I'll recommend it to pretty much anyone."
2,Originals,"There is nothing like the original ""Twist & Shout"", although the Beatles run a close second!!! If you love to dance, this is the CD for you!"
2,Awesome Bag,"I purchased this bag in Caldera Red, which is kind of a cranberry color. I plan on using on vacation and needed a bag that would let me carry my camera, passport,makeup, my husbands stuff and everything else plus to be functional and still look stylish. This bag should allow me to accomplish that. I'm very glad I got his bag, it's adorable. I think I may get another one because I like it so much."
2,This disc just BEGGED to be re-authored...(explanation below,"Hey guys--here's a quick tip..for all you who find the production on this cd to be ""muddy"", or ""sub-par"", do what I did with fascinating results: rip the tracks from your original cd, reencode them (with NERO) as .mp4 format using the highest(transcoding) quality, then before you burn it onto disc highlight all the tracks in NERO and right-click ""properties"", and go to filters tab-->equalizer...fiddle around with the ""bottom end"" and burn to your hearts content!! Now THATS the way the band probably wanted this disc to sound. (Works nicely with As The Palaces Burn, too!)"
2,Best Brew book,This is quite possibly the best brew book on the market. It was recommended to me by some homebrewers and as it turns out most of the local micro brewers also use this book. Definitely worth every penny.
2,beautiful written finale to the trilogy,"Someone in Hollywood needs to make a movie out of this trilogy. Like the first two books in this trilogy , my interest was captured in the first paragraph. The characters are so real, that it is easy to forget they've all been dead for 1000 years!"
2,A key character in this series,"I'm very happy to have found this DVD. Turns out I could have ordered it before as I'm in Japan (Region 2, like UK).This was a very 1970s-era show, a great time for TV and movies, still mostly pre-political correct and pre-formula. If you don't know the difference between then and now on those terms, then you're watching without thinking.I like everything others have said about this series, but it amazes me that 13 reviews can go by without anyone even mentioning William Smith as Falconetti. This was for me the best villain-bully characterization I've ever seen. Every moment he was on screen was chilling. I couldn't believe he was merely acting."
2,AMAZING!,Amazing performance! Acoustic Hotel California blew me away! Why couldn't The Beatles bury the hatchet before Mark David Chapman decide to play God?
2,Great for reluctant poets,"I did a poetry unit with my 7th grade, and some were not interested at all in poems. Many did enjoy this book, however. It is gross, but that's what 13-year-old boys like. We read several from here aloud and counted the syllables, and it really drew some students in. If you pair it with someone like Basho or Issa, I think that students get a large range of ideas and see that they can be poets too, even if their subjects aren't traditional."
2,How could I travel without this?,"A year ago I bought a six-pack of these and used every single one (some of them up to three times each, thanks to the super-absorbency) by the end of our two-week vacation. Our son was potty-trained for only a few months, and we were concerned about him not being able to ""hold it"" while we searched for restrooms in unfamiliar places or while we were stuck on the plane. Well, we used this in lines at Disneyland (wrapped a jacket around his waist and stored it in a drawstring, waterproof ""wet bag"") and even on the plane (no one knew!). The odor really is eliminated in most cases, unless it's super hot out. I've even used it over the span of a couple of days with no leakage or odor problems. Now, we are sure to keep at least one of these in the car for when we have to pull over on the side of the road for a quick pee break. Great product!"
2,A great item,This flag shows that I am a supporter of the Philippines. They are a people that need people to see how wonderful they are. Americans can learn a lot from them. It's a great place for us to unwind and be able to put our trouble behind and to go back to what we are here and hope that we can bring back some of the good parts of the culture back with us.
2,Work Great!,It works just fine! The usb cord was combatible to my garmin and so that a plus! And for price it was a great investment!
2,Good Game,"<Graphics> 5/5 Well, this is my first GameBoy Advance game (just got SP the same day) and of all the other GBA games ive played this has got to be some of the best side scrolling games garphicsever. The exploshins are very detailed and so are the enemys.<Sound> 5/5 Supurb. Wow. Excellent.<Gameplay> 3/5 Sometimes youll find yourself beting the game in under 2 hours (i did). and it so fast and the story line isnt that great but it leads to some cool action"
2,Review for a Nobel Prize winner...,"Review by a non Nobel Prize winner:Dirty details of the progress of our United States Currency are the theme of this book. If you like the arithmetic to pop out as you look at text, and are one who likes absorbing and detailed accounts which provide tools for thought, you should like this collection of papers and essays on money. I did."
2,"larger than life, and now we know why...","The book still doesn't cover the whole story, but to finally hear the words from his own mouth is what we have been asking for. From meeting Manson, to the concussions, and records label turndowns, the book is thorough and very witty. One thing though, I have made room on my bookshelf for volume two, because we all know this larger than life rocker isn't done yet!"
2,WOW!,This is a great documentary of deaf people and culture. It has a great history and some interesting insights from deaf adults and children! I am happy this movie was made to help many hearing people understand the differences among the deaf people within the world and the effects it can take. I hope parents see this and are given all options for their children who are deaf.
2,Awesome,"An absolute must-read for ALL parents of both boys AND girls. Being a feminist, I had to keep reminding myself that when we take care of our boys we also take care of our girls. It has transformed the ways I look at my son and also my husband and other men in my life.Along with Reviving Ophelia it should be mandatory reading for all parents!(...)"
2,so cool,"this album is the best in this world for a man like me. i spend so mucht time on road and this album was my best friend in intro the years. i lost it(the album),and i miss it."
2,Good continuation of B5,Excellent story and solid acting make this LOST TALES disc a lot of fun. I am hoping it does well enough to make more in this series because the B5 universe is deep and expansive. The special FX in this release are the best B5 effects you will ever see.The increased FX budget coupled with tech advancements make the station look better than it ever had.I recommend it wholeheartedly for B5 fans. A must own.
2,Death Band Night Band Blood,"Holy roller, where'd this mutant of an album emerge from? What vast aquatic expanse did this near necessarily classic album expunge iself'? Luckily...the end product isn't at the seeming excrement left by Burnel (that dappy lad gone fetal on the left) but is instead and most sincerely there most confident and aggressive albums of that Stranglers era. Fast and utterly violent, ""Black and White"" strikes like a quick jab to the knob and ultimately settles like a bruise you so sickeningly enjoy showing others. Be proud, all those that heard it at its birth and the newer gobs claiming it as the holy grail of 80's post-punk revelry. ""Toiler on the Sea"" should be commissioned and given a rank, while ""Death and Night"" is a slopper of a track, boiling on obsessive with a crash like opening that still gives me jollies. Seek out, indeed! (the George Melly track is also a grin maker)"
2,It is so real sometimes you forget you're reading,"when i read ""sleepers"" i felt like i was in hells kitchen in the '60s and watching these kids so happy at first then seeing their lives torn apart in 1 day. i felt like i was watching these boys playing basketball with father bobby. it is one of the best books i have ever read."
2,Great book!,Read it in only two days because you want to find out what is going to happen next. Only negative is how he switches back and forth from stories. It is a little hard to keep up with. A must read!!
2,Good,Expensive but works as advertised. Mounted on my Acura MDX quite easily. Went on a trip to Yosemite with family and friends and it worked great carrying a full-size and an umbrella stroller + other miscellaneous cargo. No issues at high speeds (~80 mph). Looks great too!
2,Must watch - inspiring,"Inspiring film about letting go or everything you know and everything you're taught you ""need"" in order to be ""happy"" and finding yourself. Definitely recommend it!"
2,clock in time,I have this clock and really enjoy having as i can tell what the temperature is outside and indoors. even when it is over 100 outdoors.
2,Needed a winter weather and waterproof glove for shoveling snow...,This glove was perfect for outdoor winter use during snow and rain. If you are in between sizes definitely go for the larger size. Overall a very nice glove!
2,Great Product,"This is a great product to use on your pets. I've used it on cuts, sores, wiping hot spots, between toes when an IDC developed. It doesn't seem to cause the pet discomfort when using it. Great to have on hand for those problems that can pop up."
2,Excellent field guide!,"336 page field guide of all Japan's birds. Comparable to Golden's Birds of North America guide. Illustrations are very accurate with arrows showing key identification features. Text includes description, similar species comparisons, voice, and status notes. A map is included on the same page as the text and illustration. It shows all of Japan, Koreas, western Alaska, eastern China, eastern Russia, and Mongolia. Also contains a checklist of birds and a description of 27 birdwatching locations that include a list of birds by season, habitat and transportation directions."
2,Excellent!,I enjoyed this book tremendously. It is an excellent travel guide which includes brief and thorough reviews of places of interest throughout Egypt. I also enjoyed the many beautiful and interesting photos in this book.
2,And i havent even bought it yet!!!!!!!!!,"I have all of her albums but this one. I have looked everywhere for it. I think this is her best one yet. I cant wait until i get paid so i can buy it.If you are a big Kelis fan like me you will love this cd to pass up this for your music collection.I cant ever give over the fact that Kelis isnt as popular as some of the rnb singers today.But i know she is the best, and so is AALIYAH.PS:go to www.ULTIMATEKELIS.com and support Kelis!!!!!you can watch her rare music videos,listen to all her songs and download photos, and AIM icons too...........thank u"
2,"Finally, one that fits","After breast reduction surgery I didn't know what bra to wear anymore so I went on a quest to find the perfect one for my new size - 40B. A difficult size to find. And I discovered that bras that were less constructed were more comfortable. I no longer need a lot of control with my new smaller (for me anyway) size. I would have loved some of the t-shirt bras, but they only go up to 38B. When I found this bra it was the end of my search as it was very comfortable, didn't fall off my shoulder, and wasn't cut too high under the arms, with just right control. I'm tall also, and it adjusted fine. If you have similar problems, try this bra and I think you'll like it! Warners - please do this same configuration with a smooth fabric and it will be the PERFECT bra."
2,LOVE this product,This product has already paid for itself in the money I have saved not paying to get my brows waxed.Its a little more tricky to apply the wax that I thought (they make it look super easy in the salon) but that's down to me not the product. I cannot fault it at all and am very happy I bought this one.
2,Brother HL5250 DN Printer,"This printer is everything I thought it would be when I purchased it. I am using the buildin network interface and had no problem doing the configuration. The only issue is when it warms up it pulls so much current, I get a warning from my UPS but it quickly goes back to an acceptable load."
2,cool cloaked guy,"the first time I passed it in a book store i thought ""oh that looks cool,"" but i didn't buy it because i was already reading something. the second time i bought it because i had nothing to read and i likedd the cloaked guy on the cover. I found the book amazing. I reccomend this book to anyone who loved The Lord of The Rings."
2,Wonderful Product,"Boy, I am sure glad I bought these. The two plastic holding clamps for the awning supports cracked and was not holding the supports in the stowed position. These Velcro straps work great. Even after the awning out, I put the straps around the handles that click on the support arms and this way I do not have to worry about the awning supports coming down. Must have for any RV'er with awnings."
2,It r0cks,"MxPx did a great job on this compilation, it's not THAT punk, but it's ok. I feel like I've heard these songs before, but i never really did. It made me wanna hear those oldies once more."
2,Book for Pet Lovers,"As a dog owner, I immensely enjoyed the stories Mr. Herriot shared.Along with his skill as a vet,he shows a great heart.Anyone so caring and tender with animals is truly a decent human being."
2,Applied Crypto was just what I needed..,"AP was exactly what I needed for the practical background necessary to implement the cryptosystems used in a number of products we've built.I found the book to be excellent, thorough, and well written - highly recommended (and hardly ""shelf ware"" as some of the other venom-filled reviewers have claimed)."
2,Fans of the Last Shadow Puppets Ought To Take A Listen,"Terrific artist deserving of much more fame in the U.S. Followers include David Bowie, Bryan Ferry, Nick Cave as well as newer artists like Tindersticks, Arcade Fire, and the Last Shadow Puppets. Good song to start with is 30 Century Man (featured in The Life Aquatic Soundtrack)Cool info on Scott Walker at baroquepopradio blogspotCan't wait to see the documentary[ASIN:B00227A81A Scott Walker: 30th Century Man]]"
2,"great construction, a little snug for 8 players","this thing could survive anuclear attack. heavy as heck, but it rolls nicely on its casters. the gaming area is a bit on the smaller side, but it still works well enough. it is a bit snug for 8 players to fit at at once, but 6 players fit nicely. definatly a great addition to game night in the garage."
2,Compelling tale....,"This was a good, readable book; and it told a compelling tale of a young hard-rock miner, from his stabs at different jobs to his eventual career as a miner. It takes one through his apprenticeship and various adventures in the silver mines of Idaho, until by the end of the book he is a competent silver miner. I would not call Mr. Dolph a great, or even a very good writer; in fact, I doubt if he would describe himself so. He writes with an honesty and a self-effacing wit that more than makes up for any stylistic shortcomings. This book delves into a lot of the minutiae in terms of tools and techniques that a miner needs to master, but I never found this to detract from the great tale he has to tell. And, in spite of, or perhaps because of, his slight shortcomings as a writer, this is a fascinating book. He writes like someone you might like to meet."
2,"Parker's back, full throttle!","The best Parker I've read in ages, tho even his lesser books are great fun. Sunny is sharp, wise, funny, tough - the writing sings, and the character descriptions made me laugh. I'd rank this right up there with the best Spenser (Early Autumn, Looking for Rachel Wallace). Parker is back in touch with his twinkle, and his love of women -and at the peak of his form. Best in genre I've read in years."
2,brain on the go,"I've bought this toy for my daugther ( she's 6 ) and she loves it, it's a good toy to use alone, to share with friends or even with her parents ( myself ). It's a good option to the computer, she also carries this toy with her stuff when she goes outside."
2,WOW!,Excellent display of immigration to the New World! I like the appearance of the various artists. It is refreshing to hear many voices on a single album.Many excellent songs.A classic!
2,most important overlooked poet of our time,the work of bernstein is moving and disturbing. his style is unlike anything I have ever read before or since. If you are looking for a book with brutal honesty and raw force this is it!
2,THE GREATEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME,"Like the movie Airplane, every time I watch Forrest Gump over again there are always little things that I had not previously noticed. Except unlike Airplane, Forrest Gump combines its humor with real drama and moral statements. Every individual scene is a whole movie and moral in and of itself -- The Value of: Persistemce, Believing in Yourself, Enjoying the Simple Pleasures of Life, Forgiveness, Sacrifice, Duty, Honor, Following Through On Comittments, Helping Others.... I could go on and on. Superbly written and acted. I was ecstatic when the movie and Tom Hanks were appropriately recognized by Oscar."
2,Mind boggling...,"I'm not real good in the math department, and geometry was just about a foreign word, but following the drawings, and especially the DaVinci materials (since I'm an artist) was extremely interesting. I know that man was much more than just an artist, and finding the ""doodles"" of the flower of life that he drew that no one understood was a MAJOR coup! I bought book 2 first, not knowing it was a literal continuation of book 1, even with page numbers and chapters, which had I known, I would have bought book 1 first - so that was a bit difficult with all the referrals to book 1 information. I will get book 1, and read and re-read all this most fascinating information. I am on a spiritual awakening adventure, and this book was very deep but enlightening."
2,Great price,"Our son was so happy. Silent hill fan and the new games are not cheap. Looked great, played great. Thanks."
2,Life Promise Pride Love,"Is the bomb. If you wat to see SADE at her very, very, very best get this video you will never be sorry. I just wish they would come out with a CD of the same tunes. I would buy that to."
2,Takedown,My son read this book for an extra credit project in 7th grade Language Arts and enjoyed the book. He got full credit for the report he wrote and he would recommend the book.
2,Ally McMarathon,I'm almost embarrased to admit this...but I watched all 3 videos / 6 episodes the day my order arrived. I've never missed an episode of AllyMcBeal yet and really enjoyed revisiting some of the best.So why only 4 stars? Because the set doesn't include ALL the episodes...the first season was one of the best. It must have been difficult to choose only 6.
2,a real gem,This is an original well-written handbook that ensures that you don't end up in the typical tourist traps. It's awful to see how many people wander around holding the same copy of 'The Rough Guide to' or the other big name guide books. The Little Black Book has great recommendations and doesn't bog you down with superfluous detail - it's the kind of good advice that you'd get from a friend who lives there... and who doesn't need that?? Thoroughly recommend it...
2,Impressive account of Robert Cormier's career,"I first read this book a few years ago and was impressed by the author's detailing of Robert Cormier's career intertwined with his novels (much is devoted to The Chocolate War). Well worth reading. Hopefully the author, Patricia Campbell, will write a revised version soon."
2,Worth the Money,"These play mats are great for outdoors. I bought several packs and put my daughters play house, slide, sandbox and etc on them. You can hose them off. We leave them out all year long, and they held up great through the winter. They don't ever look worn. I just went and bought more to extend the play area."
2,This book had a big impact on me,"I am not a reader by nature & never have been but I remember this book from high school. It really made me think. I was looking to buy a used copy, don't understand why the prices are so high."
2,I LIKE THIS GROUP,"Vader is not my favorite band but they do kick some serious ass.Doc is a madman on the drums with pummeling double-bass assaultsand intense skin banging,great vocals and killer riffs and solo's.This Vader album is probably the best yet.It's really the only one i've gotten into.This is not death-metal(it has talent in it)if you are a death metal fan and are into Cannibal Corpse,MorbidAngel,Deceide then you will not like this.Now if your a fan ofSlayer you will like this to an extent.But if you're like me andare a big fan of heavy metal/metalcore and like bands like As ILay Dying,Bleeding Through,Lamb Of God,Killswitch Engage,Chimaira,Poison The Well,Pantera,Slipknot,e.t.c then Vader's Blood+ReignForever World will be a God-send.Get it now."
2,"Great Sound, Very Comfortable, Easy to use.",These headphones are perfect for use with my ipod and i love to use them when tuning out my roommate. I feel asleep with them on once so they are some of the most comfortable over-the-ear headphones I have ever owned. Great style and very fast shipping. I love these.
2,Not a bad CROC,"These shoes are overall pretty good. Pretty comfortable, not quite as good as I expected but not bad to be sure. I good choice for the money. B+++++++++"
2,Chihwaseon,"Directed by the great living legend of Korean cinema, ""Painted Fire"" tells the tempestuous life story of Oh-won, one of the most famous artists of his time. Played with bombastic, larger-than-life ferocity by Choi Min-sik (of ""Oldboy"" fame), Oh-won is a tortured, raging alcoholic and inveterate wanderer who's cursed by his humble beginnings but blessed with an unnatural aesthetic talent that helps him survive and prosper in the tumult of the Chosun dynasty. Im's portrait of this restless, passionate spirit is also a masterwork of period filmmaking, boasting extravagant costumes and rich, earthy cinematography."
2,Great Results.,"I have been fighting breakouts for decades. I have sensitive, acne prone, combo, thick skin. I would never dream of putting oil on my face regularly. I am very happy with the results. 2 drops after cleansing has been the best for my face. It doesn't clog my pores at all. It is supposed to be the closest oil match to our natural skin oil. It seems to clears out the existing acne. The oil works on my hair to get rid of fly aways and frizz. I use it on my daughter's hair and skin (and she has sensitive normal to dry skin). I use for baby massages also. It so is lightweight."
2,"Good, but not all voices","I love the MercyMe version of ""What Child is This"" from the WOW album and it is the reason I bought the song book. I wanted the choir I'm in to sing it for Christmas this year.However, I was very dissapointed to find that the song book only lists the vocal part for one voice and did not include the harmony part. I'm sure that we could figure it out, but we are short of time and this means we won't be able to perform it this year.Otherwise the book is nice. Very large in size, big print, and all songs listed."
2,Life In A Circus,John Wayne in this action adventure is the head of a circus with a past that haunts him. The main problem I had with the movie was that the sound quality leaves something to be desired. It sounds like the applause is canned and down as well and some of the conversations are the same when they are conducted within the circus tent area. The message of the movie was very good and I enjoyed it. The problem with the sound I am sure was with the original movie and not any fault of the company that shipped it out. Thanks for an excellent movie. RWM
2,The best!,"I saw this movie three times in theaters and still enjoyed it despite the tween brats that were sitting up front. The movie really brings you back in time and you get to see a romance unfold before your eyes. some may complain that it didn't have the ""magic"" of the tale of tristan and isolde but this is an awesome rendition of the story itself. Excellent acting on all parts and it really holds your attention. i'd give it ten stars if i could"
2,The best by far,"I've read several technical books on the subject of computers but this one was by far the best. The 1300 pages seem like a mountain at first, but Minasi makes it an easy read. Explanations are simple to follow, there's a ton of information and a few laughs here and there. A must-have for anyone who wants to further their knowledge beyond the basics."
2,Bad GAme,i wish i never bought this. it stinks. i thought it would be fun like crash team racing or mario kart but it is nothing like them.
2,"Beautifully Crafted, Immensely Enjoyable","Waiting for the World to End is a beautifully crafted first time novel by Nicole Hunter. From the very beginning, I was intrigued at the richness of the story and complexity of relationships among the characters. Being a lover of poetry, I found the descriptive imagery in this book thoroughly enjoyable. This novel is a realistic portrait of the struggles of the human heart; I found myself stopping and thinking about the choices I had made in my own life. I would read, pause, and ponder. Read, pause, and ponder. With every chapter I read, it sent me into a new world of thought. Nicole Hunter is a talented word-smith. I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys beautiful literature and thought provoking characters."
2,Shoo Wap B Doooooo,"I cant stop singing these songs. And Lord help me if I didnt go and by the C.D.Soundtrack. And each song brings up those one liner jokes that are priceless.It is one awsome animatedmovie/story.My boys and I still play around(even in public)saying lines like,Is this water safe. But what about bacteria and Its a Piranna! My Buttttt! Very good adult and children movie I just love It. It has been a long time since Ive said that about an animated movie, But with this one you just cant help it. Rosie is a perfect match for the voice of turkand they even managed to make turk kind of have the same kind of expressions Rosie has.If you have children dont miss seeing this with them.So grab your vine an get swinging into your local Video store to pick up your copy."
2,Perfect combination of info and flash for 4-6 year olds.,"Our four-year-old boy rates this ""The best!"" Vitsie offers a unique combination of hard dinosaur information, singing, dancing and a wonderful human/robot star. It has none of the cloying sweetness usually associated with material for this age."
2,Please STOP CRYING!!,"I'm just on my way out the door to grab my copy of the eagerly awaited Indiana Jones Box & thought I'd see what some reviewers think of the transfers & the box as a whole. All I can read is how Lucas has ripped people off again & the crappy cardboard box the movies came in. Seriously!? Ok; I too am sick of the studios ripping consumers & movie lovers off with over-priced, underwhelming box-sets that don't deliver on the quality we expect. But as far as just releasing the first 3 movies; it only makes sense to include all 4 movies in an Indiana Jones box set! I don't think the studios care if some already own the 4th movie. That's what ebay is for. Or just wait til the movies come out individually like the Godfather trilogy or Die Hard. Since I already own Alien maybe they should offer a box set with just Aliens-Alien Resurrection. That makes perfect sense! 5-stars all the way! BTW I didn't buy Crystal Skull just for this reason!"
2,The Proper Care and Feeding of Marriage,"For a Marriage to work you both need to be working together and headed in the same direction and working for the same goals. Is you don't all of the books in the world will not help a marriage. But if you work together, I think most marriages can overcome the problems, challenges, or hard times. Remember it is not greener on the other side of the fence, it is just the other side of the fence. Don't throw it all away for what you think might be there, work hard to keep and improve what you have..."
2,This World Is Nothing Like You Think It Is,"What an absolutely thought-provoking movie... period. Whitley Strieber's euphoric experiences shapes our lives in ways that we could never have imagined. Movies are almost always difficult to be made and expressed in the same way as are books, but the awesome Christopher Walken pieces it together in the most brilliant way. His acting is superb. To see Christopher Walken portray the full range of emotions that overtakes an abductee such as Whitley Striber is to see his greatest acting skills ever!Make no doubt about it, Communion brings forth to the attention of everybody watching it, the fundamental questions of life that we have all been looking for."
2,Short handle but excellent quality.,"I purchased this Fiskars splitting axe for splitting a large quantity of logs resulting from some tree work in my backyard. The composite handle is of excellent quality, as is the head. Very competent at splitting logs with an ergonomic motion. The only downside about this axe is that it is a bit short in the handle length, causing me to adjust my swinging style from my double sided chopping axe. This is important to note because it can result in swinging short and hitting your shin. The blade stays extremely sharp with little sharpening needed. Very happy with this purchase."
2,fascinating,"Read the book and found it hard to put down. If Gaston Leroux seemed to some not to have been a good writer, I didn't notice that he wasn't. I was able to relate the book to the 2004 movie as it followed Leroux's story pretty well. While the movie concentrated on the romance aspect of the story, the book itself was more involved in what seemed a few plots, e.g. murder, mystery, romance, horror and I even found some humour. Good book, even with it's sad ending."
2,Swamp Thing: TV Series,"This was an very good tv-serie for, what it had to work with, DC-comics made an very good series in the comic book and this tv-serie was an good one."
2,Mindfields shows TOTO at a more elaborated level,"Along with Asia's Aqua this is one of my favorite AOR albums. TOTO has always been one of my favorite bands,It's 80's style is great and one can always count on getting what youre expecting when you accquire a TOTO album. Now,this album continues holding that great 80's overall sound except that this time they have made a notorious progress to their music and sound,improving the compositional side of their usual great musical-identity. there is a more rock-like feel and quite a varied fusion of diferent styles-elements that make this a very interesting and great album."
2,Works Well!,"I bought this item for my wedding dress! I wanted to make sure that I ""tried out"" the cincher before my big day and it works really well! I started out with this same item, in a Small - but it gave me ""back fat"" which I do not normally have...I returned the Small and opted for the Medium and it works like a charm. When wearing the cincher you have two ""size options"" with the double hook closure..which allows you to let it out more around the bust & tighter around your ""natural"" waist to create a better shape. It definately does the trick and is made of rubber material(def makes you sweaty...but it DOESNT move around) Totally worth it!Kinda painful...the boning pushes into my ""under/side boob"" probably because I am not super skinny immediately under my boobs...(size 36 DD)Ladies, if it helps..I am 5'2 135lbs busty, not super skinny but not fat(size 27 in jeans)"
2,A Camera for any Princess,This camera is great. We got it for our 4 year old to take to Disney with us and it not only took decent pictures but was very durable as she dropped it a couple of times. She loved being able to put all of the pictures with her and the princesses in the album and take to school for show and tell!!!!! Great buy for your little picture taker
2,Awesome movie but more dedicated to the Alien fans.,"GOOD:* GREAT storyline.* AWESOME story (very interesting and entertaining, the predator stories have never failed on this).* COOL one to one fight between alien and predator.* Great special effects.* COOL character desing.* Touching ending.* Good acting.* Dark settings.BAD:* Two predators died in 5 minutes.* The pyramid was not a good place for this two species to fight.* There was no action until the middle of the movie.* The aliens were very strong for the predators, this is not good for the Predator fans.* Stupid idea for the ending before the closing credits.P.S: Two things:* This movie is not exactly a sequel to the Predator and Alien movies, it just based on the ideas and stories.* Im a Alien fan, so I guess that why I enjoy that movie better than others but I still think it should be much better. I hope the sequel will be better than this!ADIOS."
2,This book could be a drug itself,"Just simply a fascinating read. I had my copy on the coffee table during a party, and one guest picked it up casually, and never put it down throughout the whole event.This book is just a wildly ecclectic assortment of essays, but taken as a whole it is much more than that. I think it changed my view of the world."
2,Good Book!,I liked the book. It outlines the major ideas and equations nicely and has some great examples. Seems like a very good book.
2,A Life Altering Effort...,"Yasbek changed my life. After listening to this CD, I was different. It taught me a better way to be alive. I felt for the first time in ages that life was going to be okay, that maybe I won't slit my wrists. I might even begin to like people again and leave the apartment for the first time in two months. He's a genius, and a madman. And he wears such sensible shoes!"
2,"Lucid Dream, interesting name.",This unit seems well built and was shipped well packaged. I didn't notice the smell that others have noted in the reviews. The soft texture and slightly fexable shaft are a plus. This should make our time together interesting. It certainly has a good range of vibration intensity.
2,Do I have all the Scooby's yet!,"I have a Scooby lovin' kid! I know I don't have all of them, but close enough. This is another winner he enjoys watching! Recommend the ""Pup Names Scooby"" movies - they are great!"
2,Excellent heat pack,I have been using this for over a year now. So far no complaints. For a couple of times I had a sprain on my neck and This was my only relief from the pain for many days. I stopped taking the pain killers after the first day since the pain was a little lesser now and in 3-4 days I was back to work again. I kept using this for 4-5 days more till I was completely recovered.
2,Good with only one problem,"This is a great game. It has a variety of play modes, and even a fun ""daily play"" mode that can be done once and you can watch how you improve over time. The only problem I have with it is that it only tracks one high score! It's annoying because when I was first learning, I put in an insanely high score on the beginner level and it's turned out to be impossible to ever catch up to it when on the advanced level. This one high score shows as ""the"" high score regardless of which game or play level.It's a minor issue, though, and one that I haven't worried about too much. This is my favorite DS Lite game."
2,Loved by my cat,"My cat hated being brushed. He would run away whenever I took it out of the drawer but with his shedding, the brushing needed to be done. I tried the zoom groom and my cat absolutely loves it; he sits patiently while I brush him, purring the entire time. The only reason that I rate it 4/5 is that it doesn't trap hair very well so I usually have a moderate amount of clean up to do afterwards. It does the trick though and it makes the cat very happy."
2,Extremely valuable resource,"This book is an excellent resource for composers, sound designers and audio programmers who are focused on developing and creating interactive and adaptive audio for games. Regardless if you are utilizing Microsoft's DirectMusic Producer, you will find the techniques and strategies for creating interactive music extremely valuable and useful no matter what development tool you use.Don't be intimidated by the wealth of knowledge and years of expertise from the authors. The straight forward creative and analytical approach to presenting the concepts in this book make it very well rounded for all readers. The case studies are particularly valuable in that they provide real-world applications of creating interactive and adaptive audio for the top games.As a music composer for games, I highly recommend this book to both those who are currently developing audio content and to those aspiring to create audio for games."
2,2011 best year yet,"Having attended a few UFC cards live last year (UFC 130, UFC Versus Pittsburgh, UFC 132, UFC 133, & UFC Versus Washington DC), there were some incredible fights that I can't wait to re-watch on Blu-Ray. They have not yet announced the fights yet but out of the 13 title fights, a few of them I would not consider the best of 2011 just because they are title fights (GSP vs Jake Shields was a snooze fest, and Florian vs Aldo was as well)... I really hope they revive some of the fights that were on the undercards like Michael McDonald vs Edwin Figueroa, Edson Barboza vs Anthony Njokuani, Nik Lentz vs Charles Oliveira, & Alex Cacerees vs Jimmy Hettes... Tons of great fights last year and I hope they can get it right on this blu ray... with 17 fights left, I'm sure they will"
2,A sweeping experience!,"My favorite of her albums so far, Sura adds addictive rhythms to Chloe Goodchild's spiritually evocative voice. The main theme of this album is Hinduism, though other relgious traditions are touched upon as well. Her voice is low, open and expansive. The lyrics are repetitive, addictive, and often (not always) in foreign language. The songs vary from exciting invocations of Hindu spiritual beings to gentler, sleepier, more haunting almost ""lament-style"" songs influenced by other parts of the world. The sound quality is strong and professional.This is definitely ""experiencial music"" - music that makes you feel transported to a dessert with the hot winds whipping through your hair, and ancient temples crumbling in the sand. It's very powerful in that way. But it's definitely not for people who prefer ""songs"" - as in, clear lyrics and clear melodies.I recommend it highly for people who like to be swept away in sound and spirit!"
2,Love this,"Fits wonderfully in the fridge, is easy to put together, filters do not cost much at all. The water tastes great. Simple and easy."
2,Cranberries do it again,"I always like to think of The Cranberries as storytellers. Dolores O'Riordan has really grown up! (hence, Wake Up And Smell The Coffee) She talks about motherhood (Happy Birthday Baby), About being strong, and my personal favorite #9.Her first album was good, although it was saddening, the second was very strong and is overall the best (in my opinion) of all three! This one is progress in the making! Beautiful album, would recommend it to anyone needing a lift, or a push!"
2,Review Under Forced Servitude to an English Dude,"4.5 stars, to be exact. The counter doesn't allow decimals, but it would be a sin punishable by the Hammurabai penal code to give this a score less than a 4.5.This is possibly one of my favourite Nirvana CDs, it's also their first album, produced by Sub-Pop. I enjoy this CD because it embodies the darker side of Nirvana: the highly cynical, mutually indifferent aspects. Although the lyrics are somewhat difficult to comprehend, it's not difficult to relate to the raw energy that the three-piece rock group radiates. If you are an artist, I guarantee you'll like this CD."
2,It's about time!,"I don't know about you, but this avid Alfred Hitchcock Presents fan is over the moon with the news about season three. You know, I am not sure how the business of releasing DVDs works, but the wait for this fantastic show is now available for pre-order--and don't you think I haven't already ordered mine. I am like a kid in a candy store, ready to catch up with the Master of Suspense himself, as he narrates these half-hour thrills and chills and takes us back to a time when classic television was at its best.T.B. Grant7.22.07"
2,Great Fun,I played Kismet as a kid and was thrilled to find it along with the other game Spill & Spell. Either game is great fun alone or with opponents. Highly recommended!
2,I'll keep it but...,"I used the compressor to add air to 4 tires, approx. 5-7 psi per tire and it worked fine, didn't take too long. However, there are 2 problems with the device - 1. After adding air to 2 tires the rubber inside the nozzle was already ripping and becoming unattached so that it would get in the way when trying to connect it to the valve stem, after 4 tires it was very ripped up. 2. The compressor vibrates so much that you can't put it onthe ground while running or it falls over. I guess that's the price you pay for the light weight of the compressor. While the rubber seal is a concern, it's not enough for me to return the compressor because it did work. I only hope the seal doesn't get so bad that the nozzle won't keep a good connection with the valve stem."
2,Good Vacuum,This is the best vacuum I have owned yet. Although only time will tell if the great suction will hold up.
2,More Proficient Motorcycling - Mastering the Ride,"The Book is Great, However the pages are coming unglued and falling out, individually. Very bad book binding process, must contact Bowtie for concerning issues."
2,5 stars for a 7 year old,"I'm 14 years old and still enjoy a great Disney movie and this was another one. However, I watched it with a 7 year old and she thought is was the coolest movie ever."
2,Ryan's reveiw,"I thought this book was one of the best of all the series I liked this book because it is full of action and adventure.It was exciting when Alex used the medicine ball as a sling shot and knocked out the guy.Not even a sniper's bullet can stop Alex Rider. He is back and this time he is facing a terrorist group called Force Three. When Alex saves a billionaire's son, Paul Drevin, he is swept away to a life of luxury. Now MI6 is once again giving Alex no choice to spy on Paul's dad. Then he finds out that Ark Angel is going to be blown up and it is going to fall from space, right into Washington and destroy the whole capital. Will Alex be able to go into space and prove once again that he can stop this or will he die trying?I recomend this book to a 8-14 year old and anyone who likes an action,adventure and a little mystery."
2,A must buy for any Dave Matthews Band Fan,"I love, love, love this CD set. It is by far one of the best compolations of the Dave Matthews Band that I have ever heard. The acoustic guitar solos provide an added bonus to the otherwise perfect songs, and the blend of lively and mello music is awesome. These two CDs come everywhere with me and never leave my car. I just can't seem to get enough of them."
2,Absolutely perfect!,Very attractive and serves the purpose nicely. My yorkie cannot get over it. It looks much better than the plastice gate I previously used. It is perfect in every way and was very easy to assemble.
2,strange...,"It is not the way that Sakamoto used to delight us. It is rather a begining of a new era, a ""sampled"" era. The album is ok, except the first track - Too comercial(that's what I think)...The best track nr2 and 14.However, strange album - gut but strange..."
2,"Great product, I wish I would have purchased in 30 years ago.",I have seen an improvement in my gum and know the Waterpik has made an difference.
2,THE QUILT TRIP....,A FANTASTIC HANDBAG TREAT TO ADD TO YOUR WARDROBE ! YOU CAN NEVER GO WRONG WITH A KATHY VAN ZEELAND HANDBAG. START YOUR COLLECTION TODAY !THIS BAG ALSO COMES IN BLACK AND CREAM...ALL THREE ARE WONDERFUL.
2,Great Recording! - Poor Battery Life!,"The JVC GZMG255 is a great little video recorder packed with features. Its small and light weight, and fun to use. Easy to get the video off the unit via USB and burn to DVD. The only downfall is JVC includes the BN-VF808 battery which only gives about 1 hour of run time. If you want to upgrade to the next battery BN-VF815 it will cost you an additional $70.00 for 2 1/2 more hours of run-time. Overall would give the unit 5 stars for ease of use and video quality, however -1 star for JVC cheaping' out on battery life!!!"
2,Great Blu Ray Disc!,Solid performance by a band I have enjoyed for many years. The video quality is superb. The 5.1 DTS HD Master Audio is excellent. I have a relatively high end home theater that was designed for audio performance more than movies and this disc sounds and looks as good as anything in my collection.
2,New packaging for shipment,"My Woodrack arrived today. The manufacturer's box was packed inside an additional box so it arrived without incident, although the shipping process definitely bangs things around a bit.The rack itself is nice, and for $40 it is hard to go wrong. For $70 I wouldm't be so happy. After all, it is just a bunch of square painted steel tubing."
2,have not yet seen the movie...,"I have a fourth of the way left to go in the book and I can't stop thinking about it. The irony is astounding and the word choice creates and atmosphere of being inside a writers head. Chabon portrays the lifestyle of a struggling writer in a way that mirrors the theme of the book--eccentric. There is something special about a book and its author that includes allusions to popular culture, films and other literary works. The allusions throughout the book bring the reader closer to tripp and leer. I look forward to finishing the book but I am dreading having it out of my life."
2,A MUST READ - Very Informative,"We were trying for over 1.5 years to get pregnant. I thought I was very knowledgeable from my own research on the internet, but I learned even more from this book. The book is very candid and thorough, a must read for anyone trying to get pregnant. I became pregnant the cycle after having read the book and was spared the agony of infertility testing that the doctor had recommended."
2,Nice score,Very clear score. All instruments are labeled at the beginning of each system on every page. It is nice to have all four symphonies in one place. The binding stays open well.
2,Couldn't put it down,"Gives you a real live, unsanatized look @ what hell our front line soldiers must experience. I appreciated his honesty and his frankness at what he had to do to keep his sanity and get through each day. Not a book for the faint of heart, it is hard hitting, fast paced and full of graphic language. Just what you would expect in a time of war."
2,myself fantastic,this was a great film as far as i was concerned but not a favorite of all the family. i would have given five star but because the fiancee totally didn't like it and mixed reviews of the three children i gave it a four star rating.
2,Realistic sized Functional Stove,"This is a great stove, with the three burners with seperate functional controls. Each control works equally well and all burners provide large heat capacity. The stove has a large enough surface that you can use normal size, even over size pots and pans instead of having to use small pans and still have them hanging over the edge. You can use the large bulk propane tanks without having to use adaptors and pressure reducers. Removeable liner is easy to clean. It is larger than the normal two burner in both width and depth. A great stove."
2,Memory book,"My friend who is in a nursing home, and who has fond memories of receiving from her mother-in-law a book of Mark Twain's stories, has shared memories with me of reading Mark Twain to her children - hence the gift of the above-mentioned book of Mark Twain's quotes. Delightful all the way around."
2,One single missing...,"It didn't really suprise me, but still it's a bit depressing. The single ""High Cool"" is not within this box. Which still makes that one hardcore rare with only 500 copies. Just for you to know true lovers."
2,Super Product,If you are afraid of falling when out walking on the ice buy this product. The have literally save my butt from many a bruise. I cannot say enough good about these.
2,Takamine jasmine s34c,After some filings on the metals bars frets i was able to elimate the vibration made of the first string to the metal bar of the fret board. The sound is very good. I love my purchased. I recommend it to anyone who likes playing guitar. I paid $80 for my guitar at amazon.com. Im very satisfied with it.
2,As advertised.,"Works as it is supposed to and it came through the mail on time. The cable is nice and long, so it can be wrapped around either side of the TV.I purchased on sale, but I would recommend at full price as well."
2,How rare: characters with integrity,"After seeing this series via rental, am purchasing it. Have never done this before. Yes, there are questions left, but really are for the writers: there is clarity about William's [deceased] wife in just a few lines, enough said. But not a clue about what Mary saw in the father of her children or in her last boyfriend [would hate to think she always makes poor choices since that would be an inditement of William, and we can't have that]; or why she would [working single mother that she is] have paid a dating service 700 pounds. As the writing is excellent I know the answers could have been worked into the script. The characters grow [including up], evolve, are ""real"" without being dysfunctional. There is comedy, but the comedy of life rather than pratfall slapstick, which the Brits can do in embarrassing abundance. To describe William as a ""lonely undertaker"" does no service or credit to the role. Makes him seem one-dimensional and wierd. The acting is superb."
2,Great Read,"This book was very insightful, and thought provoking. A must read for all managers, especially first timers. Worth multiple reads."
2,I AM,I am real fan of Gigilo and I am never disappointed in anything he does. I AM is a continuation a wonderful video we saw of this same theme.
2,BIKE CARRIER aaa+,"I HAVE TRYED OTHER TYPE BIKE CARRIERS, BUT I VEFOUND THIS STYLE TO BE THE BEST,,,, eea YOU DONTHAVE TO LIFT THE BIKES AS HIGH AND STRUGGLEINGWITH THE BIKES IS MINNNAL"
2,He has a gift,"He is originally from New York, so he does not have a bland TV accent. However, he is understandable. He is very animated and clearly enjoys his work. He keeps the ""show"" moving by not dawdling along as some audio professors do, but he does not talk so fast that it is hard to keep up.He does a terrific job blending ""black letter"" law with hypothetical cases. A worthwhile outline can be constructed from his audio. (However be aware that his ""pinch hypothetical"" example does not work for all courses/professors. It is the difference between ""battery is an intentional harmful or offensive contact"" and ""battery is an intentional contact that is harmful or offensive."" He subscribes to the former and some authorities subscribe to the latter.) He provides a thorough review that has really helped me prepare for finals. He deserves 6 stars. :)"
2,Refreshing and Vibrant,"Reknown for her flair and boldness, Vaessa-Mae's new album has once again proven that Classical music can be enjoed by mainstream audiences. Choosing Vivaldi's 'the Four Seasons', Vanessa-Mae pours herself into the music and adopts the much-lover masterpiece as her own. Her interpretation is refreshing and energetic, and draws comparisons to Nigel Kennedy. Also featuring on the album is 'the Devil's Trill', which includes a vibrant techno version. It becomes apparent that Vanessa-Mae is influenced by various musical influences, and this should provide anticipation for future albums. If you've never really tried classical music before, or if you think it's boring and dull, then try this album as it may open your eyes to a whole new range of music."
2,"Great Drive, Great Price....","Fantom drives are great! I think people beleive the user reviews are a substitute for venting their personal issues, lol.I have two of these, both have worked for over a year, 24/7 backing up personal and work related data, and I have never had a problem. Micron stands behind its products without fail.The unit is quiet, makes no discernable noise, unless one turns off everything in the room, and sits close to it. I know some ""reviewing"" products do that, and they should get themselves a life. Or at least rent one. :p"
2,The right cable? Check.,"I originally purchased the Syba SY-CAB40006 cable in order to save a few bucks (I just needed to clone a hard drive and then reuse the old cable). When I received the Syba cable, it was not a SATA cable, it was a power cord! It wasn't the packager's fault, it had the correct serial number.Anyway, the SY-CAB40006 is under review by Amazon right now, and they agreed to credit my account $4.00 so I could purchase the Tripp Lite cable with overnight shipping. When it comes to cables, there's really not much to review, as others have mentioned.Is it the right cable? YesIs it long enough? Definitely yesDoes it work? YesDoes it have fiber optics that make your case glow? Nope."
2,Night Soldiers,Another excellent Alan Furst novel. It's great to find a new author who is not simply a formulaic writer. And it's also fascinating to see Europe between the wars.
2,Jean and Brown - very comfortable,"I'll admit I bought to see if there really could be a difference in shoes over $200 vs regular shoes. Boy is there ever! THEY ARE SOOOOO COMFORTABLE. They came in a dust bag, even the soles are made of leather. The jean bottom and Chocolate brown leather top are very neutral."
2,Wonderful product but beware,"This is the second scala-500 I ordered, this time for my parents. It has great sound quality and is easy to use. However when I ordered it it said it came with a free car charger, yet when I received the order, not a car charger in sight. I called Tiger Direct, where the product originated from and they were completely rude and unwilling to help. Then I called Amazon and they couldn't have been nicer. They are shipping me the charger free of charge. Thanks, Amazon"
2,This is awesome,Joshua Redman's music has truly been an inspiration. He is one of the sole reasons that I LOVE and listen to jazz and this CD is a testimonial to the AWE that is J. Redman.
2,an excellent book,"This book changed my life when I was 17. Now, 30 years later, I give it as gifts to friends and family who need to learn how to live for the moment."
2,Cheap and worked great,Took about ten test sheets to get the ink flowing right but eventually everything started working great. I would purchase again.
2,Couldn't do without it!,"I have used a water-pik for the last few years. This was a replacement, and the water-pik hasimproved since the last one that I purchased. Sure wish that I had started using a water-pikyears ago. This new one seems better made, and has stronger pressure."
2,Excellent Crime Drama,This Crime Drama is Excellent. this Crime Drama is Highly enjoyable I'd recommend this Movie to people Mainly guys because it's mainly a movie for guys Michael Madsen once again does an Excellent Job and this movie doesn't disappoint either but there really isn't any chemistry between Harry and Kit and Billy Bob Thornton does an Excellent Job as a Bad guy in this movie I saw this on T.V. a long time ago and I wanted to see this movie again because I didn't remember seeing it this movie is only ninety minutes long but even though it's only ninety minutes long I would still recommend this movie to guys that haven't seen it it's a good movie but however this movie really isn't one kids should see at all I'd recommend this Movie for the Adults and I'd recommend scooby doo for the kids because there's stuff in this movie that children shouldn't be seeing and there's language that kids shouldn't be hearing i.e. profanity overall I hope this review was helpful.
2,MADE INTHE USA!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"All cotton, and made in the USA.In a time when it seems NAFTA and GATT are making jobs are our chief export, it's nice to find good quality made at home goods!We owe it to ourselves to promote from within.I am not unionactually a stone cold pro-life republican. But I know these are good items and provide jobs to taxpayers!!!"
2,Absolutely HYSTERICAL!!!!!,"IF one could ever possibly dream that Hitler and the Nazis could be made into a camp send-up, then this movie is the dream become reality!! I have never laughed so hard in my life. Although based on REAL events that took place in Hitler's Bunker, there is obviously a GREAT deal of theatrical license at work in the dialogue. You'll never believe what comes out of these people's mouths! When Alec Guinness declares that there is ""no shortage of cream"" in the Bunker, I just completely lost it... It's nowhere near as accurate as Downfall, but who needs accuracy when you've got an over the top Alec Guinness chewing up scenery and screaming at the top of his lungs. It's an absolute LAUGH RIOT!! Buy it, even on VHS."
2,Good book,"I enjoyed reading this book. It was thought provoking and one of those tear-jerker, feel good kind of books. It wasn't as strong as Tuesdays with Morrie, but it was still interesting. If you let it, it makes you think about your own life purpose...and how every action has a reaction...how each person affects others, without even meaning to do so."
2,A great song for anyone who has been passed by...,"This song has great lyrics, great music, and with the sexiest soul siren singing it, makes it perfect! And it also includes the much loved song from her GAP commercial, I know I loved it. A must have for any Joss Stone fan!"
2,The Top 12 Resources Youth Workers Want,I really enjoyed the practical ideas when working with youth. You can tell this guy knows what he is talking about. Great book for any youth leader.
2,Get's the job done!,I am extremely happy with my CHI flat iron! I am growing my relaxer out and this flat iron makes my hair as straight as if I had chemicals in it.
2,Pioneer Work,"The work of Tego Calderon is also an example of the creativity that is possible to find in this genre. The lyrics are not as clearly understandable as Calle 13's for example but this is a recording that is very rich and complex and requires repeated listening, which is is a good thing."
2,The Best Rechargeable Batteries Ever,"Eneloop rechargeable batteries are THE BEST! Their charged shelf life is incredibly long, unlike the other well known name brands that lose their charge on the shelf in a few days, and those well known name brand rechargeables don't even have half the life of a regular battery while in use. Eneloop rechargeable batteries, however, last as long or longer on one charge as any alkaline battery on the market.There's no other battery in my opinion, and once you have enough eneloop batteries to cover all your battery applications, you'll never buy another battery again. Try them - you'll definitely like them!"
2,Why is this not on Region 1 DVD?,"Based on Ken Follett's bestseller and real events, a terrific tv mini-series with Burt Lancaster as Col. Art ""Bull"" Simons -- the leader of the legendary raid on Son Tay, N. Vietnam -- Richard Crenna as Ross Perot and Paul Lemat. It tells the story of Perot whose EDS employees in Tehran are seized by the govt of the ol' Ayatollah Khakamani. Perot hires Simons to break out his men after all other means fail."
2,Fun Action Figure,"I bought this action figure as a Christmas gift for a friend and soon realized how much I wanted to play with it myself. The figure is great because it comes in such bold colors and has a unique hairstyle. The way it is built seems to be pretty durable as well. It also comes with a seperate green plastic lantern recharger which goes along with the super-hero's back story. (Of which you can read on the back of the packaging.) Speaking of the packaging, the front could have used a little more imagination as it seemed to just lie there but in the long run it all boils down to the toy. And I can't say enough good things about it."
2,"Very bright, very useful, but not very warm light","This light is very bright for a battery powered tap light. The timer feature is a nice touch, and the ability to disable it is better still. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is that the light has stong bluish tint to it. I don't mind, but others in my house do."
2,Got me through Europe,"I bought this book because of the reviews I read and it lived up to the hype. It came in handy in both routine and emergency situations - particularly when I had left my passport, money and credit cards on a train in Italy and had to communicate to the stationmaster in Genoa!"
2,Unsurpassed Quality & Value,"It is amazing how little of this product you need to get a rich, full lather to cover your face (multiple times). My tub has lasted five full months of once-daily use, and I still have slightly less than half of it left. As for quality, I have never experienced as close or comfortable a shave as I have with T&H Ultimate Comfort Shaving Cream. I use a Merkur Futura DE razor for days when I have time for a full shaving experience, and a disposable two-blade for the days when I am rushed, and the results are always top-notch when I use this cream on top of a Proraso Pre-Shave Cream. Do not be put off by the price tag on this product, as it is really an investment in nearly a year worth of close, comfortable shaves."
2,It is an interesting puzzle,"I see this item as a puzzle/sort of lego set. My nephew wanted this for Christmas and it is a good item for him to work on his fine motor skills, and on being patient. It looks like a great game, and he loves it."
2,No longer a 100% reliable product.,"This came as described at a decent price. 14 gauge is a great all-purpose wire. One side is silver and the other side is copper. Nothing on the package says Metra though. It says Raptor. All the Metra wires say Raptor ""made in China"". Metra's best deal is the 100' 10 gauge for $38 delivered.UPDATE: I got another one of these and it was short 6 ft. When doing in-wall wiring, that's not good. I had to make an extra trip to Walmart because of Metra. The other complaints about wire length against metra may be true. The only reason I found out was because I knew how long of a wire I needed. When it was short, I then measured the wire against a tape measure. 6 ft short is a large percentage on 50 ft. I will no longer order from Metra."

2,IDK,"Ordered for a coworker. No complaints receieved, just placed the order as requested. need seven more words to clear review."
2,Self-Actualization Creatiity Theory in Action,"I read this story to college students when teaching Maslow's concept of self-actualizing creativity. This is the story of a seemingly ordinary little girl who grows up and crafts a life that is, for her time, quite extraordinary. Miss Rumphius is a wonderful role model of curiosity, confidence, stewardship, and mentoring."
2,"A story of growth, devotion, and inspiration","Hard to believe this isn't memoir. Perhaps it is...Jerry Sowles has written a book about salvation, growth toward human potential, and inspirational, all deriving from the love of a good woman with the unforgettable name of Forget Me Not. She is Jerrod's Korean wife, a woman who married him based on her believe that he's different from others, a man who can offer her options not available to her as a woman in her own country.Truest Love is far better written than the majority of most self-published books and deserves to be read by a wider audience.I wish Jerry Sowles all the best as he progresses toward his stated goal: ""to write like John Irving."""
2,Illuminating,"Like some of the other people who have reviewed this CD, I went to see JB perform during his live acoustic tour. I think the music on this recording is very true to that experience. You get a really good sense of what it was like to be there. More importantly, I think this CD gives you an idea of what the core of each song is, without the extra instrumentation and added background vocals. You feel like you are hearing the songs as they were written. Whether this is true or not is, of course, impossible for me to say, but you do get new insights by listening to this wonderful and intimate CD. This one is a must for JB fans."
2,HIP-O RECORDS DELIVERS AGAIN!,"Wow! What a collection! 40 tracks on two CD's. I'm not saying that there isn't anything less than a number 1 hit here but the vast majority of the tracks contain well known and great stuff. I am trying to collect all of the Hip-o Records ""Gold"" series album and I am discovering that they are all results of choosing the music that goes on them very carefully. This album is no exception. If you don't have most of these tunes already, I highly recommend this album. Thanks!"
2,Surprisingly suspenseful,This isn't your typical Nicholas Sparks love story. It's a mystery that anyone could relate to. I'd call it romance with dark twist.
2,Best Drawing Books,Best drawing books for kids. I got this one for a Christmas present for a 10 year old that loves to draw.
2,it works great,I used this one as an additinal connection from my onkyo receiver to the sound bar. It is working great at a great price!
2,Close to home,"My brother went to school with Shari at Lexington High School. I remember when this terrible tragedy happened. It broke the heart of an entire town. BUT, one thing that helped us all heal was witnessing the faith and courage of the Smith family. This book is a bright example of how, even in the toughest of times, a family followed God's light and overcame their darkest moment. The town of Lexington has never forgotten Shari or the Smith family."
2,I Am Buying This Today!,"Last Sunday, at home, ill and it was my birthday, what a drag. I came across this show while channel surfing. I have Direct TV (over 200 usually useless channels) On BBC America, a marathon of this show was running all day! I couldn't look away! Smart and funny as hell! I didn't touch the remote even once. When I returned to work, I asked my co-workers if they had heard of LB. Not one person in my office. What? Could living in Tucson, Arizona have anything to do with this? Well, I'm getting this and will be enlightening as many people as I can."
2,The Dave Matthews album we should've gotten last year!,"This is a great album.. we should've gotten this last year.. but we never did..instead we got ""Everyday"" this album is great, I can't say anything about it.. only Bartender for some reason skips and I have no idea why? but I still have my receipt so I'll return it in exchange for a new album.."
2,Nice and Chunky,"I bought these on the presumption they were Murano 'Made in Italy' tumblers, but they are actually made in Spain. No problems though, as they are of good quality, very very heavy, and also very thick. For that reason I believe they are very sturdy and should be resistant to thermal shocks that plagues most tumblers on the market. Thermal shock will show up as a crack that occurs with no provocation - it's the glass waving the white flag for too many hot and cold dumps into water. The rim itself is also very thick, and will surprise you when it greets your lips. The rim is also uneven, with a few bumps and lumps, adding to its already 'hand made' appearance. As stated, each of these glasses is a one off - that is, no 2 are the same. For the price they are a steal."
2,Tastes great,I just like the taste and the fact that it's green tea I haven't lost any weight but I love it just the same. Sweet mild taste unlike regular green tea.
2,Razor sharp,"I've had this knife in my block for a while now, and I'm still impressed.For a cheap knife, the stamped blade performs very well. The edge is razor sharp from the factory, and stays that way with minimal effort. Treat this knife well and you will be very happy.That said, before you buy, give some thought to whether you want a straight or curved blade. Victorinox makes a similar knife with a straight blade, which may be preferable depending upon style.Don't be put off by the lack of flashy ""Three Rivet"" styling. This knife is all business."
2,"Absolutely simple, absolutely amazing!",What really drew my attention to this book is its simplicity. I also liked the variety of cultures this book represented. This one is a must in any kitchen - bon apetite!
2,Excellent for Christian Investigators not of Orthodox Heritage,"This title provides a captivating look at the Orthodox Church, past, present, and future. While not written as such, the first few chapters indeed present themselves quite excitingly. One can tell that the early and Byzantine church was a period of which the author is very proud.However, when relating the history of the church in the early 20th century, the author tends to become a bit confusing, which is somewhat understandable considering the times in which the book was written.Most of the text is still relevant, but as the Iron Curtain fell, the position of the church in former Soviet republics changed. For historians of Eastern Europe during the Cold War Era, this presents a captivating viewpoint of a theologian struggling to advocate for a faith tradition that is long, proud, and storied, but for general readers this section may indeed be useless, because much of that information is now anachronistic."
2,The first non-electronic Mag Fields EP is a must-buy,"House of tomorrow is a must buy if only for one song: Love Goes Home to Paris in the Spring. The first time I heard it, on a 45, I cried, as did everyone else in the room. Sure it's another patented Stephin Merritt heart break/love song, but the tone is more final and certain compared to later songs: ""I've had enough/you never give me anything/Don't you know love/goes home to paris in the spring?""When this EP first came out (as a 7"" - it WAS definitely a good value when it was originally released, don't blame Merritt & co for changes in technology) it was described by the band as their 'loop song' ep -- each song is comprised of a single loop, repeated over and over and over, on analog instruments. At the time this was downright revolutionary for them, as they had not previously recorded with live instruments. They occasionally return to this loop format, but not nearly as effectively as on this recording."
2,"Classy, Unique and Antique!","I have only heard one song on the radio from this album, which was ""I have the moon and stars"" and I absolutely loved it! I went straight home and looked up the artist on best buy to listen to the other songs on the album. I am definitely buying this album tomorrow!"
2,"Sexy, Sultry, and Strong!",The best overall musical show experience I have had in years. I can't wait for the DVD so I can watch it over and over! Zeta-Jones smolders and the whole cast is wonderful. The music is just fantastic from beginning to end.
2,sensuous sounds sing to my soul,"The Epitome of an after 7 album, perfect for a lovers evening at home that takes you ""to Another Level""."
2,riveting read,"I wish history would be taught with books like Escape from Mount Moriah. In times like these when so many focus only on Klout scores, numbers, and data, Jack shows us the value of keeping history alive. He does it with ease. Escape from Mounth Moriah is a riveting read; I read it cover to cover, not even interrupting for a second cup of coffee.Jack has mastered the art of expressing what others have said with many words. In his chapter NOBODY KNOWS ANYTHING he has his father ask the question:""Do you want order?"" ""Or truth?"" Usually, they wanted order.George Orwell would have been impressed.My favorite story is I RESIGN. It is about the choice between two words: resign vs. quit. And with it Jack says it all: It is our state of mind and our deliberate choice of words that make us who we are.Thank you, Jack, for this masterpiece."
2,Onion John,"I thought that this was a kind of book that was really hard to understand at times. This was a really good book about friendship. The friendship between these two friends is powerful no matter their height,age, or lifestyle. But even their frienndship has changed because at the end of the book they go their separate ways. I recommend this book to any person who is beginning to make friends"
2,Works like a charm for Nintendo64 emulation,"I couldn't find a better gamepad for Nintendo64 emulation. Six buttons allow for A+B+C pad setup like on the real controller, with the Z mapped to the left shoulder, R mapped to the right shoulder, Start mapped to the S button, and the left analog as the analog stick.I don't know why everyone else complains about durability. This controller lasted me five years. It didn't fail until I accidentally broke the circuit board while swapping out a worn rubber dome."
2,A Long Kiss Goodnight,One of my favorite movies. In Blu-ray it's even better! I just wish it had come with a standard DVD in addition to the Blu-ray disc as so many titles do these days
2,Excellent Book,We used this book in my 4-saturday pruning class. A book that you will have forever. One of the best on the market. I highly recommend this book to those who want to learn the proper technique on pruning and why you prune and how you prune correctly and when to prune.
2,buy this if you are really serious about practice,"a still forest pool ... i like the imagery . it's more than just a title though .don't expect to find too much guided meditations in this handsomely bound ( and equally handsomely titled ) book . the basics were all there for me to start practicing , but its not a manual on meditation . its much more than that .i liked the anecdotes , each a gem of wisdom . it verily beckons us to descend off the heady heights of the mountain to start practicing here and now , in the mundane grind of everyday life . this is where it all happens .mr. kornfield must also be commended for a fine job of putting this book together . each little vignette isn't haphazardly thrown together . this is a book best read slowly , a few pages at a time .highly recommend it for all those who are really serious about practice ."
2,A must have,"This masterpiece has set a standard of its own. The reason it didn't get the last fifth star is simply the awful ""Love conquers all"" version (with a happy ending) on disc 3. Cineatics will of course find even that part interesting. I recommend anyone to buy this box, you deserve it!"
2,Amazing,Hands down this made me finally happy with all ive done to my ar. Ive gone through 3 red dot/ holographic type sights and this one just made me smile the entire time shooting it. I havent noticed anything on battery yet and its been on there for about three months and i shoot and train every weekend. Very easy to zero in and no telling how many rounds ive put down range its held that zero. I was pleased with how fast the package arrived and came in a very durable box. The only thing i have to say dont do is use the know installation just makes the item look cheap and its pretty much a huge bugger sticking off the side of something nice. Do it the right way and use the hex nut your will be so much more please with the results. Btw installation was very simple took a max of 2 minutes and i was good to go.
2,Good product,"I bought this to supplement a Spanish learning program. It works well, easy to use, no problems. Would buy it again."
2,Stories that sing,"For those unaware of Frank Stanford, unkowing of who he was, this collections of short stories has the potential to mis-lead. While I love the stories within this collection, I am not sure that this book is the best introduction to the work of Frank Stanford. That said, I recommend this collection to anyone who is familiar with Frank Stanford. This volume fleshes out a picture that is amazingly incomplete and too unknown."
2,Therapy putty,Excellent workout for a wrist/Hand rehab. But the blue putty is quite stiff and should be used by those who have worked out with less stiff putty before.
2,One of the best games I played!,"I got this game for christmas and I really like it. The game hasmany different enemies and items. The game also has excellent graphics and control. The media dimension( the place where you choose the level you want to complete)is really big and interesting. The only problem with this game is that the levelshave a lack of variety, but I still give this game 5 stars. Ifyou are a exploring and puzzle freak this is the game for you."
2,I like it,"i just bought it month ago, it is good until now, but i dont know how is it as a long time device. i hope if they change the colors"
2,Freedom Rock,"Wolf Eyes is an awesome rock band. I call it rock because they ROCK. In fact, this is the freedom rock of the future, and the future is now! I saw them open for Sonic Youth last year and I haven't been so entertained in a long, long time. Wolf Eyes is so cool, they wear sunglasses on stage! The best way to experience the music of Wolf Eyes is to grab a loved one and a good ten-dollar Riesling (or a fifteen-dollar Chardonnay if it's a special occasion), slap this CD on the hi-fi and find your bliss. Together."
2,Great a capella - not like anything you've heard,I've listened to a lot of a capella music and these guys rock! Very original tunes and lyrics with one excellent cover of Blackbird. A great addition to your collection if you love great voices and solid tunes.
2,"A ""Gift"" that will change the way you see yourself.","An amazing read. Couldn't put it down and solidified the missing pieces of human awareness in life. Told in a story format, the ""lessons"" it teaches will start you on the journey to self enlightenment. A must have if you ""sharpen the saw"" in your life. You won't be disappointed."
2,Great microphone!,My daughter loves this microphone....I purchased an amp and the sound is wonderful....finally a microphone that has good quality at a very reasonable price.
2,I strongly suggest these books to teens and adults.,This is a great book for young adults with spiritual warfare.
2,"Safely Mainstream, But Still Effective, Wisdom Here","The safe and regimental suggestions of avoiding caffeine, alcohol, refined sugar, and refined flour, while consuming a mostly vegetarian and organic diet are sound and useful suggestions, if a bit unoriginal.I read about 1/3 of this book and found it without major fault.The style is engaging and somewhat inspiring.Paulantiaging4geeks.com"
2,Great Book,"This book takes many other books and eats it for breakfast. It is huge, however it has everything that one could ever need in it. Not a book you want to be bringing to class everyday because it is larger than most phone books, however that is usually not a problem. Combines Differential Equations, Linear Algebra, Multi-variable Calculus and more in one great but large book. It may not have a lot of pictures or color but it is how it stays so reasonably priced. Would like to see some more worked out problems which is why it only gets 4/5 stars"
2,"Like everything the greatest living American Novelist writes, SUPERB","Great book that makes you feel like you are on the scene. I have always been a great fan of Ellroy and always will. The man promises to outlive Bill Clinton just so he can write a book tearing that degenerate to pieces (""can't liable a dead man"" as Mr. Elroy puts it). Can't wait for that book to come out........or for its cause for release for that matter.If you like Ellroy or you like well crafted crime novels then you will love this and every book written by the greatest crime novelist this globe has ever produced."
2,wonderful ablum,"this ablum is great, the song I hate myself in the morning is really catchy. anyone who loves country will love this ablum."
2,Cool Toy,The greatest thing about this toy is that you don't have to keep repeating and repeating your vioce to get in
2,Better Than Newer Version,"The Chronicles of Narnia by the BBC is far better than the American remake of the original film, The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe. In the American version the white witch has lost her intimidating quality. The story seems less grand in theme. Overall the best version is the BBC's version seen here."
2,Melon warmer,"I have been enjoying this beanie, it fits good and it keeps my head pretty warm it isn't too thick either so it wouldn't be uncomfortable in warmer weather either. goes great with everything else Harley i have too.."
2,A Fresh View of God,"A healing new look at Creator God, leading an all embracing relationship experiencing mercy, love, and forgiveness. A must for the weary traveler on the journey of faith."
2,Best of the Zombie Movies,"That title may go a bit far, but this one is a hoot. While the tongue is never even slightly out of cheek, and once quite literally, the requisite gore and shock value just add to the fun.I recommend this movie highly to newcomers and aficionados of the genre.Two green, twitching, decaying thumbs up!"
2,The best kind of read: both entertaining and informative,"""The Perfect Storm"" is the most emotionally engaging book I've read since ""The Shipping News.""Like ""Into the Wild"" and Sheila Nickerson's ""Disappearance: A Map,"" ""The Perfect Storm"" is a heart-stopping, heart-wrenching story of improvident sparrows, ordinary people engulfed in extraordinary circumstances.Even for one who has little interest in being on the ocean, the book is hugely informative and entertaining. It's one of those stories you can't stop reading, even though you don't want it to end. ""The Perfect Storm"" deserves Pulitzer consideration"
2,Graceful & Artistic,"This is one of the best ""coffee table"" yoga books out there. The pictures are done in black and white which make the postures look graceful. If you do display it on your coffee table, it makes for a great conversation piece, especially if you practice yoga."
2,Woah?!?................,"Ok I got this game 2 christmases ago and must say Im so dissapointed!!!!!The idea is dumb,youuse battle cards and all you do is wait to be pulvarized by the impossible bosses and can like never use your special attack.The graphics suck and the battle idea is stupid.I have never wrote a bad DBZ review but this one.I wouldnt spend a dollar on it.Just get taiketsu instead thats much better.If you want a good Ps2 game get budokai2.Trust me I guarentee youll not like this game."
2,Very Good,"It was very good. I was expected more informations about the Wing Chun history and theory. However, the pictures were excellent , as was the quality of the book's paper."
2,This pays for itself,"For about the cost of 3 throw away filters, you get a lifetime filter that provides better air flow. I was due to replace my filter anyhow, spent a little extra an got this. It popped into my '07 Altima 3.5 without any tools. A perfect fit. There's a decal to add to air intake box so that hopefully future service personnel (Jiffy Lube and the like) won't keep trying to change the filter for you."
2,Good/Ok movie..,"Ok, so the first time I saw this movie on TV..i fell in love with it! But when you keep watching it over and over..it gets kind of boring..although i don't regret getting it on DVD..I will probably watch this movie once in a while when i am in the mood..."
2,my daughter can't put it down!,This is the second series my 10 year old daughter has started reading.These books are addicting and keeps her interest. Highly recommend
2,Pet Music,"While pleasant, relaxing and enjoyable, this CD did not help my pet's separation anxiety. ""Through a Dog's Ears"" was more effective. We play this CD as it is relaxing but don't depend on it for separation anxiety issues"
2,Great recital.,"Wonderful technique, but always in service to the music. I don't know why she's not more famous, but maybe she doesn't want to be."
2,Great CD!,"This CD is worth getting simply because of the new songs on it! ""Love Will Always Win"" has got to be one of the best songs I've ever heard and it leaves you with this inspirational feeling...I love it! Faith remade ""Piece of My Heart"" into the rocking pop version--how she sings it in concert and it's great! You can also find it on the ""King of The Hill"" Soundtrack but it would be better just to buy the import because of ""Love Will Always Win"" and the pop version of ""Let Me Let Go"" which is so much better than the original...I strongly recommend this to anybody who owns a Faith Hill CD! You'll love it!"
2,Keeps active 3 year old busy while you prepare dinner!,"I bought this toy so that my 3 year old could grill with his Daddy and it was a good price. I had no idea how much he would play with it. Besides it being a little top heavy and won't take huge bumps without knocking over, it is great. The tongs are functional and took my son no time at all to get the hang of picking up the plastic steak or corn on the cob. The hamburger in our set is a crabby patty. The button lights up the grill and makes sizzling sound. That is constantly being pressed with warnings to us to not burn ourselves. I highly recommend this toy and wish I would have bought two because my 2 year old niece wanted to play with it too but my 3 year old thought she might burn herself!"
2,More Than 50 Most Loved Hymns,"Beautiful music. So many favorite hymns I remember as a child. Some of the selections were instrumental - I was thinking all selections were choral. However, still a beautiful selection of hymns."
2,A scent Flowers and Relaxation,"I have loved this perfume for many years and have never gotten tired of it. Its wonderful floral scent just relaxes me whenever I put it on, it always puts me in a great mood. I enjoy this perfume because it is a unique scent, whenever i put it on whether in the morning or at night i feel calm and just feel like iam putting my face in a bouquet of flowers. This perfume also makes for a perfect gift."
2,Please share this book with every parent you know!!!,"This book is incredible and should manditory reading for all parents. I did not know that vaccinating a child was an option until the year 2000 when my sister refussed to vaccinate her first daughter. It caused me to really think and I decided to begin research when I became pregnant in 2003. Thanks to this book I did not vaccinte my newborn and was able to make an EDUCATED dicision about this issue, not assume I had to do what the government says. I have gotten a lot of flack for this decision but it is mine to make. Thanks to Stephanie Cave my child will not have to be subject to unresearched ""testing"". My child is not a lab rat. Please be advised that I suggest you use a back up method for your childs immune safety, such as Young Living Essential Oil produts. Do not send your child into the world unprotected. Let's make this world a better and safer place to be :)"
2,A Treasury of Information and Inspiration,"Scott Larsen provides a great treasury of information and inspiration in his classic titled Indelible Ink. While perusing my copy of Indelible Ink, I read with great interest the books that influenced many Christian leaders. The accounts of the late Stephen F. Olford and the legendary Major W. Ian Thomas are well worth the price of the book. This book encourages me as a writer to press on into print.Dr. Franklin L. Kirksey, pastor, teacher, mentor, writer, author of Sound Biblical Preaching: Giving the Bible a Voice"
2,great price,I have 1995 nissan quest so this mirror is a great fit of the budget. The reason I cannot rate 5 start becasue the mirror has a little bit shaking when you drive on the high way.
2,Al'ight y'all - come gitcha some!,"Thishere movie tells it like it is: y'jist havta shoot them dam' zombies in the dam' haid t'git rid of 'em.Then gitcha' cold six-pack & BBQ & go watch the game - 'r the Spice Channel, whatever's on.Main thang is, get drunk & enjoy it. I saw the edited version on the SciFi channel last night, now I'm buyin' itchere. Uncut - I ain't interested in that guy's little wiener, but them chicks'll look purty good without that dang blurrin' they do on the TV set."
2,Guitar Genius.,Lindsey proves himself a master of the guitar and song writing for the third solo album without Fleetwood Mac. This is an incredible album and totally different from anything else out there. Some selections are upbeat and others are very nice ballads. No fillers on this one. Outstanding is 'Street Of Dreams'. There are even some short instrumental cuts. This album rates right up there with Simon and Garfunkels 'Bridge Over Troubled Water'. Very slick album. Good surround effect also.
2,Great product.,"Very small, i hardly feel it. I've had others that have straps that go around your ear and i hated it because they feel like they're weighing down your ear. This is very small and very light yet very effective and clear. Can't beat the price either."
2,Escaflowne: The Saga Continues,"This is the 5th volume to this wonderful series and it is one of the more informative ones. In it, our group of main characters goes to Atlantis (or the ruins of Atlantis) and discover the secret of it's power and the tragedy of Allen's past. Also, you find out about how Dornkirk came form Earth to the Gaea and about his obsession with the Gravity of Destiny. Must have for Escaflowne addicts."
2,thanks,Thanks this product is great and came quickly. I would recommend it to any one. I will shop here again.
2,Beautiful ring.,This ring was a Christmas present to myself. I really enjoy it and have had numerous comments about how lovely it is. Thank you Amazon.
2,I like it but,"I liked the book but I thought a lot was left out. When Mad Dog saved the young Japanese girl and spent a week with her family what happened afterword. Did he ever see them again? I know what Puff the Magic Dragon is but a lot of people think it is smoking pot. Recently I met the author and asked him some of the questions I had. He is a very quiet, religious, and unassuming type of guy and I asked him if this was an autobiography. It was. He told me he is still in touch with the family from Japan. I told him he should have put it in the book. Puff is not pot but a helocoptor gunship that can lay down a pattern of fire that a pop bottle cap in a football field would not go unscathed. Mike Simpson"
2,Movie making at its best,"It's a long way from Happy Days to the space race but Ron Howard has done a fantastic job of bringing the Apollo 13 story to the big screen. I loved the special effects, loved the acting, loved the suspense and was inspired by the music score much as I inspired by those original events I still vividly recall as a nine year old Australian school boy. My favourite scene: the Apollo 13 launch from the nervous moments in the Astronauts' fit-out rooms to insertion in earth orbit. Somehow Howard created a crescendo of drama that wasn't eased until we see scenes of Astronauts' gloves floating in zero gravity. Another feature is the excellent recreation of Mission Control in Houston. The supporting cast were fantastic. Each were quirky individuals in their own right, not clone-like extras there to make up the numbers. I liked Happy Days, Ron, but I loved Apollo 13 even more. Movie making at its best."
2,Luther was Anti-Catholic,"First off - anyone who has stuidied church history (no, I'm not referring to the revisionist garbage being promulgated) knows that Martin Luther, was Anti-catholic. He started out as Catholic monk, who discovered for himself, that salvation is NOT through the Roman Catholic Church, Mary, the Pope, good deeds, etc...rather, through placing one's faith in what Jesus Christ did for us on the cross. This is what marked Luther as a ""heretic"" to the Roman church. Sadly and ironically, our society sees and ""lumps"" all of Christianity into a ""Catholic"" wrapping. Catholocism never has, and never will be Christianity."
2,Great item,"Got this item in the mail last week and I'm very happy with it. I'm a slim guy but the armband fits nice and tight, but not uncomfortable. Can't beat it for the price!"
2,"""Everyday People"" mixed with some Kurt Cobain?....brilliant","I really enjoyed this movie. I haven't really seen much of Ryan Reynolds except for when he was in Smoking Aces, but it was nice to see Rachel Weisz. Ryan Reynolds has more than charm I think we will see a whole lot more from this guy, he really did some great acting, and to me this movie is definately more than just a chick flick/date movie."
2,Definitely worth the price,"I bought this for my Sony DSC-R1 because the small strap that came with the camera wasn't padded. The R1 is a heavy camera, and after carrying it around my neck for a week on vacation, I realized I needed something better. I've had this new strap for a few months now, and have been on vacation twice more with the new one. It's a great strap.It actually makes my camera feel lighter, which really surprised me. I'm guessing it's due to the padding on this strap. It's very comfortable to wear around my neck even if I'm carry the camera for 10 hours a day. My only complaint is that the shape of the strap makes it more difficult to carry the camera on my shoulder than I would like. I've looked at other straps, but for the price, this one can't be beat. I also love the small pouch which allows me to carry extra memory cards."
2,Fun for children!,"These are mess free and great fun for children. We drew a black and white mural and the children filled in the animals with these by making dots. (Pointellism) It was mess free and very colorful. Don't expect to ""write"" with these like regular markers, they are made purposely to produce dot shapes. Great for grades K-4."
2,Really Memorable,"I think Jordan (the main character), is the type of man that most women would kill for. Unlike his 2 crazy brothers. :o) This book was funny, romantic and touching. You could feel his pain over the break up with his best friend Soloman. I wanted to give him a can of whoop a--!! Kimberly was lively, adventurous and real. The hospital scene with Jordan and her parents had me rolling on the floor laughing. Thanks for making my couple of days Mr. Dickey. Great job!!!"
2,learn hawaiian,"It's great, I listen to it every chance I get, the hard part is no one on my block to speak with. :)I've learn to say a lot of stuff and know one knows what am saying. cool!!!!!cheers!"
2,.........................,"Why do people keep writing hate reviews? I mean no one gives (...) about what you have to say obviously because nellys albums were #1 and #2 on the billboard charts. Wow you may hate it, but who gives (...) about what you think about it. It aint gonna change peoples minds about whether to buy it or not. Dont you people have better things to do? Seriously?.... i sometimes think no. Well anyways get a life and stop voicing your opinion because no one cares..... well at least I dont."
2,"A true love story, with a tragic end","I am a huge figure skating fan. I had the pleasure of meeting Ekaterina and Sergei at a fundraiser in Halifax in 1994. To watch them skate was magic, and to read their love story was to read about pure happiness. Ekaterina shares her life on these pages with the reader, and tells us of the Sergei she knew and loved. For him to pass on at such a young age, only makes the story more sad and hard to understand. Ekaterina has written a lovely tribute to her husband, and is a 5 star read for any figure skating fan, or person who wants the insight on a real life love story."
2,Love it,Such a great movie! Love the life lessons this movie teaches. For significant others and families! Watch this over and over
2,Skiing the Backdrop But is Much More,"From great character development to a fascinating read, Mr. Kaplan has hit the mark with a first rate first novel. I thought I picked up a skiing book, but it is only the setting, not the terrific story threading its way through it. You won't be disappointed."
2,The other Stephen Fry,"For fans of Fry's first novels (and I am fully in this corner), this is an unexpected departure. Yes, the stylishly wry writing is served up to some degree, but here he devotes more energy to plot than turn of phrase, social comment, and dry wit. His adherence to the Monte Cristo storyline doesn't blunt the surprises; in fact the vengeful acts are so unexpected, so grimly dark, that they seem almost unFry.I miss the droll Fry, the upper-crusty Fry, but this new novel certainly offers other quick-read pleasures."
2,amazing,"A great movie! Super funny. I highly recommend you watching it.. Your going to laugh none stop! Then after this one, you definitely should watch laugh at my pain"
2,pursuing the passionate life,"As a woman growing older and becoming newly acquainted with a post menopausal body and spirit, I found this book to be very informative and encouraging! I am beginning to get excited about sex and relationships with men again. For awhile there I was beginning to feel ""invisible"". Thank you Ms. Sheehy for all the work you put into this book to help all of us regain or re-emerge into our womanhood."
2,My daughter's favorite toy,"We purchased ""Hugbug"" at the National Gallery of Art in DC for my then 4-month-old daughter, who was immediately drawn to the fun sounds, textures, and shape of this toy. It has been her favorite toy since, as well as a great distraction when she is upset! The arms pull in and out, the head squeeks, the legs rattle and the body chimes. And my daughter has tasted every body part! She just loves this toy - it accompanies us everywhere!"
2,Great - BUT,"This is a great computer. I especially like having the current time displayed with all the rest of the data. However, the temperature is worthless. Any sunlight at all and the temp reads way too high. Why bother??"
2,Great fit!,"I have tried at least 8 different brands and styles of earbuds, but these have the best fit, sound, and even stay in when you work out! Very comfortable."
2,"Great for kids, fun for adults, too!","I bought this game primarily for my 7 year old twins, and it didn't disappoint. They (and I) played for hours and we were thoroughly entertained.The somewhat limited 2nd player option is still enough fun to make it easier when you're waiting out your turn to take over the main controller again.It's challenging, but not so hard that my kids get frustrated while playing. The worst thing a ""kids"" video game can do is send them away mad because they get stuck, lost, or confused. This game, however, always keeps their attention.I had never heard of this game before seeing it on Amazon, but I'm glad I took a chance on it...and so are my kids."
2,Defending Gary,"While I haven't read this book yet, I am looking forward to reading yet another viewpoint on Ridgeway. This one from the perspective and insight of one of the defense attornies."
2,Fantastic DVD What's not to love?,All I can say is that it is about time! My kids love Laurie Berkner on Noggin and it is great that we now can watch more than one video at a time. I only wish it were longer because my kids love it so much. I hope they put another DVD soon. Highly recommended.
2,Going Everywhere,"Wy's latest effort is going EVERYWHERE. She goes to church and takes us with her in ""I Can't Wait to Meet You."" The song will have you shouting ""amen"" and thanking the creator for making those platinum pipes. Sure hits are the upbeat and twangy ""Going Nowhere"" and ""He Rocks."" The rest of the album is too daring for country radio because it incorporates blues and funk, but it sure sounds great. Wynonna continues to go down her own musical road keeping us fans wondering where she will take us next. The Judds songs are fun and each has its message. The poignantly sweet ""That's What Makes You Strong"" is a gem. Wynonna's musical genius makes this album like a late Christmas present and I paid her for it!"
2,Sleeping in comfort,"Having a king size bed, it is quite an expensive project for the linen for a bed of this size. I have always wanted to have quality sheets, but have not been affordable. We were finally down to our last set of old sheets, and decided to check our my thrifty store, Amazon.com and see if they had any that we could afford during these tough times. Lo and behold!! I searched through many different sets, and after reading the reviews on these Pinzon 400-thread count Egyptian cotton sheet sets, I decided to order them at this most affordable price. Wow!! They fit better than any other sheets we ever owned, even had a longer drape on the sides. No more tug of war for a little bit more of sheet to cover with. We love these sheets, and are sleeping better than we ever have. They stay in place, wash very well, and I am not one for ironing sheets, after all it is the quality and comfort of what covers us that matters, paradise!!"
2,great bit!,"This is a great bit to clean out the welding spatter on the inside of pipe. Its sharp, balanced, and very durable. Will buy another when this one gets dull!"
2,Truth to Life,"A generally excellent book which gives a powerful argument for the importance of truth. There are a few points of discussion where I would have liked more details. He touches on the idea that truth is different in different domains I was left wanting to more about this. While he critiques pragmatism, it may be true that in certain domains the value of a concept is it's usefulness. Also of course there are areas of life where truth is clearly relative. If I say I like Mexican food, and you say Mexican foods is awful, who is right? Both are really stating the truth about their personal preferences. I would have liked more discussion of when truth is indeed relative, and stating that is my opinion is not just a way to avoid argument as Lynch suggests."
2,Satisfied,This product does give the moisture along with the heat. The only draw back is that it doesn't hold the heat long enough.
2,An incredible book,"Funny and sad, touching and scorching, both depressing and uplifting. Anyone with a soul ought to read this book."

2,"Interesting, but lacks detail","This has proven to be a very interesting TV show, but it lacks a lot of detail about any of the locations. It seems to be rushed."
2,"Love, Love, Love Giorgio",This is the third pair of Giorgio Brutini men's shoes I've bought from Amazon for my husband. He's a performer with size 13 feet so it's hard to find shoes that look good on stage and actually come in his size. This brand never fails. He loves them; looks great; feels comfy. What more could I ask?
2,Not Quite 5 Stars.......,"First, I got the machine cheaper ($500) with free shipping directly from the manufacturer. I'm not sure whether or not this was a special. As for cleaning, this machine is about as good as it gets. The Infomercial is a bit of a stretch and a bit misleading, at the same time, it is still a great machine. The only problem is that the tank is too small, and I'm sorry I didn't get the wider machine. I cannot count the number of times I have to fill the tank. There are some good hints about using the machine submitted by others here, and I would like to add one more. I crank up my water heater to high before using the machine. Just be careful so that you do not burn yourself and don't forget to turn the water heater back down when you are finished."
2,Robotech Remastered Volume 4 Extended Edition,"As a longtime fan of the Robotech series I'm thrilled about these new releases. It's great to see the show again with the deleted scenes put back again and I can't wait for the rest of the series to be released.The only drawback is on every episode they show the opening and ending with credits and such. Should have that just once.Overall, a great DVD set and I recommend it to all Robotech or early anime fan."
2,"Beautiful book, but abridged","Scribner has created a beautiful book in this edition. The illustrations are on heavy glossy paper and are magnificent. There are very nice, free readings of this work online, and so I purchased the book for my young children to enjoy - to read while listening to the narrator. My only complaint is the book is abridged. This is not evident from the description. I think most editions of this work are abridged. When the book ended, I was left wondering what became of Friday, as he is not mentioned again after the final battle. The author did not seem like one who would leave out that detail, and so I discovered the unabridged story is longer. Still, the quality of the book and the beauty of the illustrations are so very nice that I cannot knock a star off my review."
2,"A Smart, Funny, Chic Relationship Movie...Hollywood Wishes It Could Do This!","I'd never heard of this movie before I saw it by chance, and only just now found out it has a prequel. Must see...Must see... Russian Dolls was stylish, fast-paced, deep, funny, and hopped around Europe like a travel show with a plot. The comparison of the relationships shown in this film and the famous Russian dolls (store one within another) was a perfect metaphor. I'm ordering it today on DVD. I loved it!"
2,Shure Sound Nice!,"These earbuds sound great. The base seems to be a little weak, but I am still waiting to get time to play with them. Well worth the money, though. They put out high quality sound!"
2,"The Painting on the Pond, Book one","I bought this as a gift for my father and he said it was a fast read and enjoyable. Came in very good shape, looked new!"
2,the perfect kinfe,"This knife is the perfect blend of multi-functionality and size. It'll do a lot and still fit in my pocket. Other knives do more but you need a belt holster to carry them. Slimmer knives leave me wishing for this or that at times (like a Phillips head screwdriver or a pair of tweezers). This one is perfect for me. I should have bought a dozen of them to guard against losing one from time to time for the rest of my life, just in case they quit making them."
2,"Not bad - an entertaining little animated flick on philosphy, metaphysics,","Not bad - an entertaining little animated flick on philosphy, metaphysics, objective human perception. if you liked 'what the bleep do we know?"" you'll probably like this movie. it's only about 85 min long, but the animated main characters encounters various people throughout his day and hears their perspectives on life (philosophers, an evolutionary biologist, young intellectuals etc.). the voices are from real interviews it sounds like and they're just placed in the movie to fit the flow...a unique movie that's worth watching. 4.2 stars. written review from a 34 yr old atheist."

2,Love the King Size Training Pads .....,The king sized pads are terrific when you have more than one dog and also you have more of a chance of the dog hitting the pad and not on the floor. Good absorption also....These are a bit over priced as I purchased more yesterday at Target for only $6.99 and of course there was no shipping....
2,Amazing.,"In the past, I have always installed Rockford Fosgate speakers in my vehicles because I believed them to be the best bang for the buck. With this new vehicle purchase I could not find Fosgate speakers at the size/price I wanted so I took a chance on these based on the decent reviews they were getting. I have to say I am blown away by how great these sound. These sound much better than the Fosgate speakers I had in my last vehicle. I haven't even replaced the factory head unit yet and they sound so amazing that I am no longer planning on doing so. I am not an audiophile; I just want crisp treble and a decent amount of bass with no distortion. These speakers have met this requirement with flying colors. I am officially done with Fosgate for the foreseeable future. Oh--and did I mention that the price on these is amazing?"
2,That Uncertain Feeling,"I got this because I have the movie poster and never knew what the film was about. It's a really old Black & White movie about a married woman considering having an affair, but she doesn't go through with it. OK if you like really old sitcoms."
2,You ppl dont know wut ur talkin about.,"This game was not copied from nintendogs. its a version of ""Dogz"" for the computer, u just cant breed them :("
2,Young men at war,"An excellent and captivating book. A 20 year old co-pilot relates his (and the crew's) experience on 35 bombing missions. The marvel of the book is that it is written throught the eyes of a young man without any of the ponderous statements or judgements that come with age. It has a lot of humor, but also gives the sense of responsibility and fear that these young people faced. I gave it to my 18 year old son to read, and he was moved by the experiences and the descriptions. A truly excellent book"
2,Barr is good.,Nevada Barr creates a mystery hard to solve. The description of the firestorm was riveting and frightening. I have a new respect for those firefighters. Couldn't put the book down until I found out the killer.
2,Not Your Normal Senior Prom,"We interrupt this review for a Public Service Announcement. It is STRONGLY recommended that you read Murakami's A Wild Sheep Chase before reading this book. While not 100% necessary, your enjoyment of DDD will be greatly enhanced! We now return you to your regularly scheduled review.I got so wrapped up in the book I almost thought I was a part of it. There was that gnawing at the edge of my mind - a glimmer of understanding. Then an insight: I am in the book! Murakami has a way of writing the reader into the story; making the reader an unmentioned character.This is too real for magical realism; it's post-modern with a reliable narrator; it has a tinge of science fiction and fantasy but is really neither. It's simply Murakami."
2,Seamless Sounding Track Selections From a Great Band!,"The tracks selections are identical to the other earlier ""Diary"" releases such as the Dutch Disky and the English Pickwick ones although the sound quality could probably do with some remastering, the overall sound quality isn't bad.This compilation album is great because the tracks all seem to run together so well that it sounds like a cohesive normal album and not like a usual jumbled up and disjointed best of compilation.The track selections represent the best work this highly underrated band has done and is a good choice if you are looking for a best of set of this band at least until they decide to remaster this.I for one would like to hear what some modern sound-cleaning technology would do for this cd. One of my favourite all-time albums and definitely a desert-island disc. Highly recommended."
2,Great train video,My sons LOVE this DVD. It has soothing music and very colorful trains. My three year old yells out the colors and types of trains and my 8 month old is transfixed the entire length of the movie. I highly recommend this DVD for you train lover!
2,"K&H Lectro-Soft Heated Outdoor Bed, Small",I ordered this about 4 years ago and it is still working well and keeps my two dogs warm at night when there is a chill in the air.

2,I loved The Golden Locket.,The Golden Locket was alot of fun to read. The character development was excellent. The dialog seemed so real. I loved the ending. The author has a wonderful imagination.
2,Nature Lover from Portola Valley loves Home Ground,I'd recommend this book to anyone who reads widely and loves to discover the derivation of geographical terms pertainig to nature. What is unique about this book is the input from 45 well known writers to define unique American landscape terms. I ordered 3 copies for all my family located in the Pacific Northwest and they agree that this book is a great resource.
2,The Muppet Christmas Carol!!!!,"I love the muppets adaption of ""A Christmas Carol""! Michael Caine is a riot as Ebenezer Scrooge! Also, this is the first muppet classic to not have Jim Henson as Kermit, for Steve Whitmire took over the role when Jim Henson died. Also, Richard Hunt died on the same year this movie was made. This movie was dedicated to their death. Furthermore, from here on, Dave Goelz will be the voice for Waldorf and Jerry Nelson will be the voice for Statler. If you want to get into the Christmas spirit, you should get this video, not ""Mickey's Christmas Carol""."
2,great product,this is a great product. I use several to keep stray cats warm as this thermocube turns on their heated pads outdoors at 35 degrees & turns off at 45 degrees all winter. I have ordered twice from this store @ Amazon & delivery was quick & accurate. Would recommend this store & product to everyone.
2,More like a 4.5 for a mix of deep house and techno,"I thoroughly enjoy this CD, both for driving and dancing. After a first track, the end of which I really dislike, some great selections make of the bulk of this mix. Cut out track one and it's a five!"
2,Flirting is as much fun at 65 as it was at 16,"I first purchased this amazing book 10 years ago after a divorceand as a direct result gained courage and found 2 redheads who filled my life up.Well, they got old (litterally) and I was getting restless.Doing an Amazon search for flirting I ran acressthese reviews on . - printed the first 10 pages outand now I'm back out trolling for babes. Its great fun againand theres this whole world opening up. Cant find my old book so I ordered another one. Get this book. It is pure magic and great fun. Joyce Jillson is a genius. send this book to friends who are worn down and watch them find the fun in life again."
2,If you are interested in Russian history...,"WE had a Fascinating trip to Russia. It made us want to know more. For a different & unusual perspective, a great and informative read."
2,Oh Revlon please make this lipstick again!,"I wore this lipstick for years - when Revlon stopped making it I hit ebay and loaded up on color ""flesh"". Alas, I eventually ran out and have yet to find a suitable substitute. This lipstick really did stay put plus you could not feel it on at all.I miss it terribly. Can you tell?"
2,Love this movie!!! Very exciting~~~,"I really liked this movie. My husband rented it and I had not heard anything about it, so I was hesitant to watch. I am glad I did! It was very exciting and the plot kept me enthralled until the end. Great exciting movie!"
2,"high detail plot,and indepth characters make this book great",~the detail of the star war's universe and the depth of the characters in Zahn's trilogy provition value=
2,Powerful,This is a powerful book. I loved it. I would also recommend An Encounter With A Prophet and Conversations with God. All three books helped me.
2,"Boost Reading Confidence With This One - a review of ""I Am""","This is a cute little book for very beginning readers. Vocabulary, though varied, is simple. The hardest words are: short, shout, white, black, and laugh. Other words would include: am, are, big, do, down, go and I, etc.The drawings are simple but cute and they amply show a variety of children with their many attributes. There are black and white children, Asian children, children with casts on their arms and in a wheelchair, and children that are laughing and shouting. The book is basically all about contrasts such as big and small, short and tall, in and out, say and do, up and down.Four Stars. [B]. A good book to boost reading confidence. Vocabulary is simple. Sentences are very short. The drawings give plenty of visual clues to remind children of what any new words might be."
2,Not a Christina fan but this cd is a surprise,"She did really well on this album. Most of the songs are incredible. Although, Dirrty is an absolute silly perverted song, I just skp over it. This cd is great and you should buy it. She really is talented and shows it in this album. The better songs are:Walk AwayImpossibleBeautifulMake OverSoarThe Voice WithinI'm OkayThere you go, the 7 reasons you should go out and purchase this album today"
2,Good results as a sleep aid,"I've taken Valerian for several years along with a 1 mg sublingual Melatonin as a sleep aid. About an hour before lights out, I take two of the Valerian Root capsules. The bottle says that a recommended serving is three capsules, but I've experimented with the dosage, and for me, two capsules are consistently effective. I've tried other brands of Valerian with mixed results, but for a combination of price and quality, the Nature's Way product wins out."
2,integrates seamlessly and yet very easy to install,"Installed it almost without even reading the instructions. Also bought the 520+ for the PC and 650+ plus for the laptop. Also upgraded to the latest firmware 2.18 seamlessly to get to 4X(did not bench mark though).Just one note, I had to reset the router for the first two days because of lost sync with the elements in the network. (Probably due to my hastiness for without even completely reading the instructions.) But since then no problems and dropped connections. I can also connect to VPN connection of my work. Remote configuration of the router through a browser is very convenient.Perfect. Quality and even esthetics are good."
2,A touching portrayal of simple people in an era gone by,Truman Capote's story of himself and his country Aunt celebrating Christmas together is one that should remind all of us of the meaning of love and caring for each other this season.
2,Nicely Packaged,"What is nice about this tissue is that it is packaged in such a way that the sheets are flat (not folded) and in a package that has a carboard insert. If you are careful and pull sheets out one by one and store the package flat, they stay neet and don't get all wadded up. They are also made in the U.S.A. I thought they were a very good value."
2,good value,I bought this version to replace one no longer manufactured by Philips and find it much improved. I like the smaller brush size and the coloration which lets you know when it's time to change them. The handle is smaller as well and fits my hand better than the previous one. It holds a charge well and travels easily.
2,Good buy,"Received as a gift. Set it up in 15 minutes, smooth and speed is great. Will see how long it will last, but very please with performance (running laptop, blue ray and Wii)."
2,This CD Rocks. I loved Neil and the music is awesome.,What a totally different music experience. Sounds Great
2,great product,I love this item! We are having so much fun with it! Product is exactly what is described. Thank you Mr. T!
2,It's good.,"It's good. I don't drink it too often now, but I think it has a good taste and maybe it is a little stimulating."
2,Adorable shoes and fast shipping!,"I really like these shoes; they are adorable! I would have given the shoe a 5, but they squeak a bit when you walk. Great value."
2,A great value!,"After shopping around for Betty Boop car mats, it finally dawned on me that Amazon might carry them - and they did! The quality was outstanding and the price was better than any I had seen. I bought them as a gift for someone and she was absolutely delighted with them. Once again, thank you Amazon for your excellent service.Lucille Van BaarsNeedham, MA"
2,pioneer of the blues,"There is nothing like drawing the shades close, putting on a set of headphones, and listening to a good John Lee Hooker disc. Whether it be something from the late 40's or his newest releases back in 2000 with John Lee Hooker and Friends. That is what was great about this man, he just got better as time went on. To start out, The Very Best of John Lee Hooker is a great way to get into him if you are interested in the blues. You wont be dissapointed. The Classic Boom Boom, One Scotch, One Beer, are great, but the others that you may never heard of are just as good. It serves You Right To Suffer, Burnig Hell, and Crawlin' King Snake are just a couple on this cd that will grab you. I give this disc 5 stars and then some."
2,Very good lounge music,"A great mix of songs/music to fill space with pleasurable sounds that never conflict with each other, yet are different from one another.Plus, as an ""exiled"" Parisian, the title is enough to evoque the wonderful Hotel Costes which is a must-see located in the heart of Paris. There, in beautiful surroundings you get to hear this music and it sounds even better!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Classic game hands down.,"Best street fighter game of them all, the best part is the world tour mode where you get to travel the world developing your street fighter character."
2,My kids love this movie,The claymation is such a different media that it holds the kid's attention. The story is very realistic and portrays a very human and compasionate Christ. We have given it as a gift and would highly recommend it.
2,I'm Holding Out,"I really want them to release the ""Annette"" series. That was my favorite. Also, wouldn't mind seeing Darlene Gillespie's series, ""Corky and White Shadow."""
2,Excellent Overview of 8 Obstacles to Faith in Christ,"I have been a believer in Christ now for over 20 years. Recently, I encountered a season in my life where I wanted to gain a better understanding of what I believe, why I believe, and why others choose not to believe. I found what I was looking for in Lee Strobel's fine apologetic treatment of the subject of faith. I thoroughly enjoyed the structure and flow of this book as Lee introduces the reader to various scholars and experts who have spent decades and staked their careers on such difficult topics as the existence and purpose of hell, why bad things are aloud to happen, Jesus as the only way to eternal life, a tainted Church history (Inquisition, Salem Witch Trials), etc. Each chapter ends with discussion topics and additional resources for further study. I recommend this book for all believers and non-believers who are searching for an excellent overview of some of the most difficult obstacles to faith in Christ."
2,An impressive work for young people,"As a professor and children's writer, I am very impressed by this book. Dougal Dixon manages to cover an immense amount of scientific material in accurate, simple and easily understood terms. The book moves through geological time from the beginning of the earth and the start of life. It gives an over view of life in precambrian, paleozoic, mesozoic and cenozoic times and focuses greater detail in areas such as fossil fish, amphibians, reptiles, etc. Dougal Dixon also gives clear yet indepth explanations of complex subjects such as the mechanisms of evolution. The book is beautifully illustrated with a combination of photographs and art work of various sorts."
2,"Good but very, very hard","I'm not use to using a step, but if you are then this is a good hard class for you! Enjoy I'm going to keep at it until I can do without stopping to catch my breath and balance!"
2,Some may disagree... but this seems to be a very deep book..,if you really look at this book hard and analyze it as if it were a dream... it is actually a very deep look at life... not gonna say how... just find out for yourself!
2,Nice,"It seems nice and the quality is so so. I think it'll last a while. The scissor assembly is a bit wonky and jerky. It does get used and there have been no major complaints from the boss, so it can't be that bad. It sometimes comes off the wall as if it were not levelly mounted (it was and I am certain). It seems that the scissor assembly is wearing out and that's causing it to be imbalanced, which leads to it swinging off the wall. There are a bunch of nylon ""slide-bearings"" that are wearing. I lubricated it with graphite powder with no real change. If I had to do it again, I'd look for a better mounting structure. Overall, pretty good."
2,I love this book!!!,I thought Ella Enchanted was great. I stayed up until 11:00 on Friday night just to read the ending. This book is basically a backwards Cinderella. It's about a girl named Ella who was born with a curse of obedience. When Ella was 13 her mother died and her father married a woman named Dame Olga who has two girls that adore Ella. Soon before her father's wedding Ella met Prince Charmont. Ella Enchanted is a great fantasy with a touch of romance. Ella Enchanted never left me bored. It is full of enchantments. I have always loved the classic Cinderella and Ella Enchanted is a great new version. All of the things that Ella goes through really make this book exiting and surprising. I could hardly put the book down!
2,Liza Minelli And Joel Grey At Their Very Best,The Music and Dancing are outstanding. The 1931 Berlin Kit Kat Club comes alive. This 25th Anniversary video has an interesting documentary presentation prior to the actual film. The movie plot is only average but all of the musical aspects of the film are outstanding earning it 8 academy awards in 1972 - a real treat. One of the best musicals of all time.
2,roaring camp,an excellent book with a tremendous message. i would recommend the book for anyone who needs illustrations about how life works.
2,"Nothing ""stupid"" about this team","I have read the book several times, and maybe I'm a bit biased, therefore disqualifying myself from making an objective review. Why? My dad was one of the members of that so-called ""stupid team"" and the fact that these men, all EDS employees, risked their lives to rescue coworkers says a lot about EDS,its' corporate culture, and its' employees. There is a lot of Perot praising (he is not one of my favorite people), but he risked his own life to see these men when they were imprisoned, when there was a price on his head set there by the Iranian government. I would say that this is an inspirational read, one to pick up if you want to restore your faith in America and the people who live here. Yes, ""good guys"" still exist, not everyone is selfish; I'm lucky enough to be a daughter of one of those good guys, and old friends with many more."
2,Bicycle touring the way it used to be.,"I first bought the book because of its Vashon Island connection, being a lifelong islander myself. But I quickly decided it's one of the best bicycle touring stories in my library -- the boys come alive in the writing, no dreary list of statistics and mileposts, just two boys becoming men on their ride north to Seattle. Puts a whole new perspective on that ride for anyone who has cycled the Pacific Coast route in modern times."
2,WORDS FAIL!,"Yup, It's just as good as everyone says. The band is just as good as everyone says. Untouchable musicianship, overwhelming passion, a representation of all that metal can and should mean!BUY IT!"
2,What I needed...,"These are great sounding headphones and the price is right. The noice-cancellation is very good as well. The design is a little bulky for wearing around since they're designed for studio use, but I'd definately recommend these for the dorm, office, home, etc."
2,"Unseen warfare, the battle for souls","These books were a revelation at the time they were written. Many christians ""woke up"" to how serious this battle really is. Unfortunately, like everything else, the fire died, and christians became slothful, lazy, and lost the fire. We forgot that before these books were even wrote, the holy scriptures talked about the unseen war thousands of years ago. These books were a serious wake up call to a sleeping church. Peretti, was inspired I believe to write these books. He was anointed by the Holy Spirit to give us a shot in the arm. These books did just that, at the time. Now, at this present time, in this present darkness, we are faced with a horrifying tragedy at New York City. Sadly, it took that display of raw, satanic, destruction, to unite the White House, the people of America, and the churches. To me that is REALLY sad. God bless him for writing these books, thankyou Frank, there hasn't been books like those since."
2,Transferring with the AR Max Drive,Works great! I am using the AR Max to transfer edits from my Fire Pro PS2 game to the Fire Pro Club site on line and downloading others edits to my PS2 system. I have had no problems at all with it. AR Max does exactly what it is supposed to do.
2,Art Fun: Tiki Facts & Lore,"A good read and a great look! Wonderful photos of the ""real"" tikis as well as contemporary re-incarnations in sculpture of Schmaltz and popular paintings by Shag. In a refreshingly non-academic style, the short readable essays offer lots of facts about the lovable, fascinating tiki icon past and present."
2,Great Product,This product is very difficult for to find where I live. I was thankful to have found it on-line. Prompt shipping. Happy customer :-)
2,The Night The Lights Went Out In Georgia (All Region DVD),i love the movie and i will continue to buy movies from you and when i fine one i like.
2,The early and great Yeats,"This work contains the poems written by Yeats from 1889 to 1914. It includes some of the classic poems of twentieth century Literature, ""No Second Troy"", ""The Song of the Wandering Aengus"""" The Lake Isle of Inisfree"" "" When you are old"" and many others.Yeats is a poetry who draws on Irish folklore and myth but his great power is in the music of his language, and his lyric celebration of life.Enjoy."
2,Genuine songwriting not often found today,This is a band that may end up changing the way people think about today's popular music. Train takes rock beyond the usual three chords- and delivers a package that is distinctive but not unusual. This is the kind of sound that makes you think you may have heard them before- a familiar sound even if it is new to you. I am sure they are phenomenal to see live.
2,moving,My kind of easy read. enough real life incidents to make you able to relate.Will try to read more of this author.
2,My son LOVES it!,My 3 1/2 year old son LOVES this castle. He's been wanting one for a while and this one looked like a lot of fun and is very durable. He loves that the castle can be open or closed and has a lot of fune with the draw bridge and the jail.
2,Sexy and suspenseful,"Stella Valoccohi is a great gal, I enjoyed her sass,strong character, and showing woman can do their stuff. I laughed while she kicked butts, or with her smart mouth. I liked the way Nancy Bartholomew writes her stories. I wish she could write them faster, I love her books."
2,New ways to play as my son has grown.,"I bought this when my son was about 6 months old. He love it then and still loves it now at 16 months. At first he just turned the steering wheel, but he keeps discovering new things to play with, most recently the blinker. He can pull off the mirror, but its easy to put back on and that's part of the fun as far as he's concerned!"
2,Loved it!,"Grandma bought this to use & it was perfect. It is so cute. I still remember them looking around trying to see the elephants that are on the clothes pattern. I do wish the back was taller as if you have a longer/taller baby then their head might outgrow this sooner than you want, but I would still buy it.It is a very cute chair that once big enough they can move around themselves. I like that it is very portable.It is a chair for many stages: sitting & learning eye hand coordination to play w/ the 3 included hanging toys (NOTE: pretty neat these are velcroed so can be taken off & played with seperately), pull the toy to play music, rock or just sit to read a book.I would highly suggest this item & suggest it early so you get a lot of use out of it."
2,The Last Legion,"Great historic movie with a lot of action. The female lead is wonderful and deadly. Just watching her fight is worth buying the dvd. Colin Firth is grand. The historic factor of this movie will blow your mind. For me, this movie is marvelous!!!"
2,Great product,"I already own 2 of the metal version of this spatula and love it, so I bought the red and black one for my non-stick pans. I thought it would be more flexible, like the metal ones are, but that's its only flaw in my eyes. That's why I give it 4 stars instead of 5. Other than that, it is perfect. I like the thin blade and tip, which makes turning delicate items a breeze without tearing or crumpling them up like the thick plastic spatulas do. Mine did not melt, blister, or curl. I know this for a fact, because I accidently left the blade in my fry pan on high when I went to answer the phone. When I came back, the food was ruined but the spatulas was perfect. I'm here to buy a second one. :o)"
2,Within Heaven's Gates,Awesome book! Wonder if Heaven is really going to be like the book says...gives me hope that it just might be! I'm blessed...
2,savage innocents,A great film one of Quinns'best. I had looked for this film for many years. I'm very glad I found it.
2,Heart shaped pancake molds,These molds work beautifully and are easy to clean (spray them with Pam or similar product before using.) They sit level on the pan and make lovely heart shaped pancakes to the delight of my 3 year old granddaughter and her much older grandfather.
2,Nothing beats the official release of TDF - 12hrs of the BEST footages from the BEST vantage points,Nothing beats the Official SBS coverage of the Tour de France - 12hrs of the BEST footages from the BEST vantage points.It's not just about watching the race but also a helicopter tour of the breathtaking french countryside.
2,Exactly what I needed,"The item was exactly what I needed. I didn't expect to pay so much shipping for an o-ring, when it was ordered with a large order of filters, so I probably won't order it online in the future, but it is just what I wanted. The shipping was timely. Thank you."
2,Nice mix,"There is a nice mix of styles and songs on this CD. The only disappointment is some of the more secular/traditional songs, which you can get on other CDs done better by other people. But it's definately worth having."
2,Environmental content highlited by two fabulous ballads,"""Vampire"" is reason enough to purchase this album. It is a haunting ballad both sensual and heartbreaking. It plays like the inner monologue of a true vampire who both begrudges and embraces her nature. Claudia's vocal gifts in this piece are what first attracted me to her as an artist. When playing music for friends I will inevitably introduce them to this piece and many times first time listeners have been visibly and audibly affected at the vocal crescendo which marks the middle of ""Vampire"". ""The Man Who Visits Me"" is a sad lament of a person/heart that finds a glimmer of love in the benign visits of a harmless peeping Tom."
2,fantastic album,"I've read all of the previous reviews and I have to disagree with them a bit. This isn't really a ""rock opera"" in the same way Tommy, Dead Winter Dead, and Beethoveen's last night are. The music reminds me of Jesus Christ: Superstar and after you've heard a little of it I think you'll see a similarity. The music is wonderful and the vocals are very well done. The only thing that I found that I didn't like was some of the chorus parts. Some of the chorus parts are run through a computer to alter the sound and it gives it synth sound. Overall, great stuff"
2,read it,i read this book over nine thousand times. i still dont know why my pants wont stay up without a belt or suspenders
2,Absolutely Fabulous,One of the best books I have ever read. I couldnt put it down. It makes you want to find all the books on the Geisha that you can find. A fascinating experience into the geisha culture.
2,More Ram,"Memory has been working since it was installed with no muss and no fuss, it is a much needed upgrade. Always make sure any memory is the right size and right type before buying, it makes the process so much easier."
2,One of the best books ever written!,"If you don't want to change the way you think, don't read this book. If you don't want to change the way you treat others, don't read this book. If you don't want to discover a simple, consistent and effective way of living, don't read this book."
2,"Great little Zippo for the price, comes without fuel",This is a nice basic zippo lighter for the price. This was a gift for somebody and for a novice like me it would help if the description said that the lighter will need to be filled up first before the first light. But other than that its good.
2,You're not in Kansas anymore Toto,"A fine compilation of their best known tunes. If you like some fine examples of great music, then you'll like this one. Fairly unique sounds that are a good example why rock music will be timeless."
2,It was okay..,"I'm not a Star Wars geek, but I do like sci fi movies.It's a must buy if you are a true Star Wars fan."
2,Ringo's Most Professional Album,"Released at a time in which Ringo's solo work was regarded more as a hobby than a career, ""Time"" turned out to be Ringo's most serious and musically consistent album. Though there are multiple producers and writers involved, the songs all seem tied by a theme: cautions about life's hard knocks from someone who's been there.The sound is professional, and Ringo seems to be trying hard to be a real singer here, not just some pal who likes to belt out tunes. It really raised my opinon of Ringo, and I'm glad I have it in my collection."
2,just what the doctor ordered,"if you're ready to cut the cord, this unit is perfect. sound quality: excellent. reliability: absolutely. value: unbeatable. fun: you bet!"
2,Great Product,"Before I recieved the iRobot Roomba 4230 I wasn't quite sure if it would work the way it was advertised? But it is a great product. Goes from bare floors to carpet without any problem, and we have a dog and right now she is shedding and the iRobot picks up the dog fur without a problem. So all's I can say is that it is GREAT and am glad that I purchased it."
2,Makes fast work of drying my SUV!,"I tried this for the first time last night and WOW! Drying my full size SUV was a breeze. VERY fast, VERY thorough, and actually fun to use. My kids were arguing about who got to use it next. It takes a bit of getting used to, but by the end of the job, I was a pro.Now, you're not going to get EVERY drop of water off, but you'll get 90% of it off and can quickly wipe up the rest with a chamois or microfiber towel.I'll probably be washing my vehicles more often now that I have this beauty to help me out!"
2,Best bag for the price.,I paid right around 15 bucks for this bag and have carried it for 3-4 months now and it has taken a bit of abuse and has held up great. I have a couple of friends that have it too and has done the same for them. i have 4 putters a midrange and 8 drivers in there and can get everything out pretty easily. I just upgraded to a 22 disc bag because my disc number has grown so much of late. Overall I say if you are a starter with less than 15 disc this is worth the investment because you can organize your disc easily and get them out at will.
2,My great pressure cooker,I've been using Presto Pressure Cookers for over fifty years. My grandmother taught me how to use one when I was 15 years old. My 8 quart is still in perfect condition but due to health issues it got difficult for me to handle. I found a 4 quart on Amazon. I have used it about twice a week since I got it. It is perfect. It is easy to use and to maintain. I rarely write a glowing review of anything but this item is high quality and meets the safety standards. Johnny
2,Live compilation,"This is a compilation of live performances Relix Records culled from the first four Flying Burrito Brothers live albums they had issued. An interesting, valid idea as the individual albums tended (with the exception of ""Close Encounters To The West Coast"") to be uneven. If you're not inclined to purchase all four of the Relix live Burrito cd's then this cd is for you. The track selection can be argued, but this pretty much does sum up the four live cd's. The lineups vary but this doesn't at all detract from your enjoyment."
2,the begining of rap,this is one of the frist social relative rap albums back when it was real. the songs are raw and porfane.
2,Excellent product!!,"Very good item, the covers are perfect and the media(the CD) is perfect, like new!!! Very very good!! MirMedia Music and Movies sold me a very good product in a very good condition!!"
2,"Simple, inexpensive, and effective","NO cat pee on sofa since we activated the alarm. Not a startling noise- not even for the cats, but it seems to work. Thanks"
2,"Huge, Fun, Pain in the butt to fold!","This thing is a monster! So much fun with the characters, the windows, the swinging door, and the ""doggy"" door. ;) The colors are bright and the set up simple!ONLY problem is the fold up... Grrrrrr! It took me 3 days to finally get it! I went to the website and found some videos on set up, only I dragged the mouse and watched them backwards because the written directions are useless. It still is not easy, in fact I would only recommend this tent if you can leave it set up full time or if you have some where to store it flat.Playhut [...]"
2,Spooky,"I started reading this book the day before the most recent crash started. Every night I picked it up, and it mirrored the current events so closely, that it was more than a little scary. Why won't we learn from the mistakes of the past?"
2,Stephanie's favorite Toy!,Our daughter got this for Christmas when she was 9 months old. She may not understand cooking but she loves to make the sizzle sounds and open and close the ovens and nibble on the egg and answers the phone by putting it on her forehead:) She *loves* it and so do we. The 2 songs that it plays are totally cool too. fyi her other favorite was her Fisher Price Learning Table. We love this kitchen!
2,The truth of who we are and how we need to function to be free to love.,"It is a compilation of reflections that Tony de Mello culled from his own life lived in freedom of spirit. Each entry is a morsel of experienced reality. I chose this book , because I appreciate Tony's vision of spiritual reality."
2,Awesome,Have been a Beatles fan for 37 years (day 1). Can't feel anything but true awe for their music.
2,Satisfied with Hal Kemp Remember Me,"Although the sound quality wasn't quite as good as the 33rpm record that my dad had years ago, it was still very good and very listenable. I was definitely satisfied with this product!"
2,Is it really that bad?,"Many Psychedelic Furs fans feel that, of all the albums they released, this is their worst. Sure, the cover photographs (with band members dressed in gaudy leather) have been, perhaps rightfully, derided, but when you ignore the image the band was projecting and focus on the music, you're in for a treat. I can honestly say I like every one of the songs on this album, although highlights include ""Heartbreak Beat"" (the album's most successful release), ""Shadow In My Heart"", ""Angels Don't Cry"", ""Midnight to Midnight"", and the excellent closing track ""No Release"". Recommended."
2,I like it,"I really do like this cd, regardless of what anyones says. I love Mine, Poem is good, Art is tight, When and Fault kick butt, and Myself and Dreams are wonderful. When i first heard it, the soft melodies did make me feel disappointed, but after a few listens i learned that this cd really is great. I love it, but that's just me."
2,EXCELLENT!,"An excellent book - however (as with most study guides) real-world experience is a must. This book encompasses a lot of information, some of which you will not find on the exam, but I used this title along with the transcenders and passed! I've also used the Win2k Pro book from Syngress with success and plan to use the rest of the series to finish off the Win2k MCSE."
2,Strong magnets!,"The plastic shield itself is kind of flimsy, but the magnets are quite powerful so it suits my needs exactly. We put it on a wall heater to help direct the heat into the room. Wouldn't recommend for a floor unit if it could get stepped on by pets or children. Would recommend for wall or ceiling use."
2,Great Boots,These boots are great. Love the style. They are pretty easy to walk in too-a little stiff but Im sure I just need to break them in. Seller great also-would buy from again.
2,"soft cotton, well-made hammock","We had purchased our last Pawley's Island hammock 13 years ago, so we thought we'd try it again. We were pleased..the quality seems just as good as it was > 10 years ago. We leave it outside most of the summer and it holds up well. It seems a bit longer than our last one, but is easily adjusted with the sturdy links."
2,A touching study of a young girl growing up in the 70's,"The story of a few years in the childhood of Meena, an Indian girl growing up in a Midland's village in the early 70's. The clashes and harmonies of the Indian and English cultures are the backdrop and the simple style describing life through the innocent eyes of a child make this a joy to read. There is a beautiful mixture of humour and pathos. The little girl who wants to join the Girls Gang led by Anita who slowly grows up to be the friend Anita needs and rejects. My only criticism is that the book had to end."
2,Love this novel,"Ordered for my Ipad as a fallback when I need something to read...ordered after I watched a marathon of Shogun mini-series on cable and was reminded of how much I love the novel...the mini-series was great, top-notch production, but still left out so much nuance of the novel...better than Tai Pan and the 3rd novel in the series maybe because I love reading about the samurai era so much...Wish they would do an e-book for another favorite book about Japan--Miss One Thousand Spring Blossoms--about 1960s more modern Japan...another revelation..."
2,Shockingly Enjoyable,"I typically lean towards much harder, darker, and more industrial music. However, this music has many layers, harmonizing like some of your more mainstream industrial metal, with a more up-beat, hookie element.The lead singers voice is beautiful, and the rythem gets everybody in the room nodding their heads and tapping their feet. Every time I'm listening to them and somebody hears it, I get an instant ""whoa, who is this?""They seem to trancend a large spectrum of musical tastes - from r&b; to rock to industrial to alternative-lovers everywhere I've played them. It's solid and just damned enjoyable to listen to."
2,Great Rice Cooker!,"This rice cooker makes the most perfect rice, and it is so so easy to make it in advance!A couple of notables:Rice-The cooker makes enough 'side portions' for 5 adults (2 being active duty Marine Corp Officer eating machines)!Oatmeal-I found the machine really only serves 2Timer-Very simple--2 available settings that can be adjusted as neededPerfect compliment to my slow cooker, Zojirushi breadmaker, and Mr and Ms Bento. Love to come home to a finished dinner and a smiling family. Makes me smile all day long.Zojirushi-Keep developing these great products!!"
2,Good Quality Mic,"Its a good interface for recording to a computer... I high quality mic, XLR, and 1/4 stereo jacks go USB to computer... The controls on this are a bit cramped making actual emitting on it a bit tricky"
2,Worth it!,special education teacher uses it in her classroom to help her students focus... it has been working out well for them!
2,Another fun Gaskitt book!,"This book was my son's second Gaskitt book, and was very helpful on a long car trip. Another chapter book with a sense of humor, it again fits the bill for kids looking for a cross between a picture book and a chapter book which doesn't preach! My 6 year old son was pleased when he understood the jokes, like the radio which greets Mr. Gaskitt personally, but always gets the news a little bit wrong, and the refrigerator that writes messages to the family."
2,This is probably my favorite Coen brothers movie,"Anything and everything you ever wanted in a movie by the Coens. Every line is genius and every character, even the smallest bit parts are expertly written and played. Every award this movie has won is well deserved. This movie was done long before the Coens gained wide attention for Fargo--but this is a far superior film in all aspects. Only here can you experience that real Barton Fink feeling. Buy this movie and watch it over and over, you'll find something new every time."
2,Piglet's Big Movie,"My 23 month old loves to watch this movie and will sit still through most of the story. We enjoy the songs and she will ask to see this many times. We also love to sit and color pages for our own ""scrappity book"". My husband and I both love to watch this movie so this is definitely a great family movie."
2,Highly Entertaining,Bought this for my daughter at the age of 4. We love how this book flows with the high and lows. It is a little outside the norm for a children's book as seen in the negative reviews so if you are afraid to try new things or experiment then do not get this book. I highly recommend this to parents who can think outside the box.
2,A Courageous Memoir About Battling Depression,"William Styron is a great writer. Most readers and movie-goers are familiar with his book 'Sophie's Choice'. Most readers, however, are not familiar with the fact that William Styron had been battling with depression for most of his life.This book is only 80 pages long but it is very deep. It deals with Mr. Styron's battle with depression. It discusses his self-medicating with alcohol. He also uses prescription medication to combat his depression related insomnia (ambien). The sleeping pills made his depression even worse. He faces a despair so profound that he is unable to motivate himself to attend an event where he is to be presented with a prestigious literary award.For anyone who has suffered depression, who has a loved one or friend with depression, or for anyone interested in what depression is, this book will is highly recommended."
2,Highly recommend for dancers and non-dancers alike,"Neither my husband nor I have any background in ballet or dancing in general, but after watching the trailer, we decided we'd give it a chance. Both of us are glad we did, as we were riveted to the screen for the entirety. Highly recommend this inspiring look into the world of youth ballet."
2,Good Machine Overall,"Overall, I am pretty impressed with the machine. I had difficulty, as another review has mentioned, with the instructions. It appeared that the design has changed and the instructions have not been updated but they are probably 80% correct.The machine is fairly stable, not as good as commercial units but this is not a commercial unit. The selection of pre-programmed exercises are good as well as being able to set the time. The heart rate monitor works and makes workouts interesting to see how high you can get your heart rate.I would recommend the machine so far. The quality of construction looks very good. I purchased the unit for $379 at a Friday sale. I think that was a very good deal."
2,The only way. . .,"The Bodum Santos Stovetop is the ONLY way to make good coffee. It is clean, pure, and entirely free of sediment.And to watch it operate is an education in itself.As for the final cleanup, just a bit of cold water, a swath of the paper towel inside the bowl, and it is done.Puts all other coffee makers and coffee brewers in the shade."
2,Excellent,Book was as described. It was packaged well and delivered to me promptly. Good experience!
2,Good,"You really have to install it REALLY GOOD. Not meaning that it doesn't have the right stuff to install it, but its needs to be LEVEL. The equipment it comes with is great. Just I based my measurements off my garage door and that door isn't level. I did a few pull-ups and my left tricep got bigger than my right. I did it reverse side to match the exercise and its pretty close now. After I did that I reinstalled it to be leveled."
2,Very Sakamoto,"As you can expect this is an excelent work of Mr. Sakamoto. Always different and eclectic but once you hear this, you really will like it."
2,the recipes work!,I love the book. The pages of my copy are food stained and water damaged from all the use it's getting. There are two wonderful and outstanding things about this cookbook. The recipes instruct clearly and the resulting tapas have been delicious. Very delicious. The book reads well also.
2,kindle version is a disaster,"reading the kindle version is infuriating. so many typos, misplaced punctuation, etc. ""John Galt"" is mispelled as ""John Gait"" at LEAST 15 times, which is an annoying distraction that pulls you out of the exposition and awkwardly reminds you that you are reading sloppily translated digital version of this classic."
2,Classic yet original,"We checked out this pattern in a bricks-and-mortar store, and loved the look (classic yet with some original touches like the different length tines on the forks) and feel (beautiful balance, though on the heavy side). The only downside to the product is that it's difficult to get serving pieces in the US. I must, however, protest Amazon's way of shipping. Each place setting, which occupied a box about 2""X2""X10"", was put in a second box that was about 7""X10""X12""; that box was then put into yet another box that was about 10""X12""X18"", and all 8 place settings were sent separately. What a waste of packing materials!!!!"
2,Nice melodic rock album from Harem Scarem guitarist!,This is an album by Harem Scarem's guitarist Pete Lesperance featuring him on guitars and vocals. I guess it's almost like a solo album although it was written and performed with another Canadian musician who I am not familiar with. There's also some help from other Harem Scarem members too so I guess fans of this legendary melodic rock band will really be interested in it. This is a well-produced melodic rock record with solid songwriting as would be expected by these high calibre musicians. It's a little more commercial and modern than their previous work but fans will dig it. Some very catchy tunes and vocal melodies make this a great album but probably not essential unless you're a die-hard Harem Scarem fan like me!
2,Great Book with Typical Flaw,"Until Bishop Wright finishes Volume 4 of his magnum opus, Christian Origins and the Question of God, we will have to do with his shorter monographs on Paul's thought. As always, the trenchant scholarship and sharp writing shines through.And, as always it seems, the same flaw appears whenever Wright tries to be relevant to the contemporary church: his ideas of Christian social justice are just the most shopwarn cliches of the most warmed over academic leftism imaginable. For example, he decries widespread consumer debt as creating ""misery for millions"" and profits for a ""tiny minority."" As if borrowers don't borrow because it is in their interest to do so, and as if lenders would lend without being paid a return for their trouble. To hold opinions like this means being totally ignorant of modern economics. It is one thing to take every thought captive for Christ - another to indulge foolishness. Remember Mark 7 - folly is sin."
2,This Could Change Your Life For the Better Quickly,"This movie should be required for every person in America. Do we have an obesity epidemic? Just look around you next time you are in a fast food restaurant, Walmart, or other bastion of food eaters. There is a reason why we get fat and it is called high frictous corn syrup. Try and find something in a grocery store without it; good luck. This movie looks at the cause of it through the use of our corn harvest. Scientifically you could be said to be primarily corn as that is the vast majority of what is eaten no matter what your eating habits are. If you are a vegetarian you are even more likely to have issues. This movie is not for the faint heart who do not want to learn the truth."
2,Wish I could find locally,Great for what it is intended for and some uses for what it isn't. Will rebuy when used up as a little goes a long way.
2,"A logical, concise treatise on Outsoucing","This is a great resource for anyone looking to outsource services. Robin Sood has done an excellent job of creating a very logical, concise manual on Outsourcing and Offshoring. This book lays out the outsourcing process step by step. I found the Executive Briefs at the end of each chapter most helpful. It is on my desk for ready reference!!!!"
2,Did Not Disappoint,I saw these reading glasses on CSI:NY and just had to have them! It's really nice to have a quality pair of reading glasses...and the WOW factor doesn't hurt either! I've read some of the reviews and can see where women with hair past their shoulders might have a problem with this type of glasses. My hair is shortish (layered to the bottom of my neck) and I wouldn't want it any longer if I was going to wear these glasses a lot...which I do! They aren't portable...but they aren't supposed to be. I keep mine in my office where I need to take them on and off the most frequently. I'll probably get another pair for home but I'll used my old ones I can put in my case for carrying in my purse. All in all...I'm very glad I got them!
2,Great Rice Cooker,"Having lived in Asia for many years, I was used to rice that was cooked well. Returning to the states I found that I resumed cooking in my old way with a pan - simply not a good way to do it. Over the years I have had many rice cookers, but this one is simply the best of them all. Easy to use, and with the added advantage of being able to steam veggies in the basket over the rice. It is no larger than most rice cookers, but is does a lot more work. The pan removes easily and is also easy to clean - an absolute must in my book. If this one dies I would buy another in a heart beat!"
2,Great prompts for a writer's group and for life review,"This book is useful to begin to collect your life stories. A memoir or an autobiography can be a daunting task, yet even a single story can be a valuable legacy for a child or grandchild. I know this to be true from work in end-of-life care. This book poses questions for reflections that can support personal life review and meaning making in the second half of life. I will select single questions for use in a writer's group in which we are capturing vignettes that represent our life journeys and for my work with Sage-ing(r) I recommend Zalman Schachter's book, From Age-ing to Sage-ing for wonderful processes for more indepth life review, life repair work, and proactive aging.From Age-ing to Sage-ing: A Profound New Vision of Growing Older"
2,The difinitive book on 007,"Finally, a highly readable and visually stunning book that looks at James Bond as a cinematic, cultural and historic icon. Entertaining and well researched, the authors and publisher have assembled a book that will appeal to all Bond fans, as well as those that are interested in film, pop culture and great looking coffee table books."
2,Rinse for Silver Hair,"This is the first time I've tried this product for my silver hair, and found that it worked just fine. No brassiness and the silver is silvery white. I'd recommend this product to anyone with silver hair."
2,Shooting for the Past,"Noir features an powerful drama of personal identity and human relationships. Not aggressively violent, the assassin's theme is merely a subplot to accompany the anime's emotional journey. Although a bit older (2001), this anime features excellent music to accompany the critical moments throughout the series. Other qualities are the extra historical references and tactics used by the girls. Overall, Noir stylishly presents a mysterious drama shot by sexy assassins."
2,Great way to get certified,"This is a great idea: pairing a solid certification book with the simulated lab for hands on experience. You should try to get your hands on a real router, but this is the next best thing. The lab is a bit buggy (and now there is an updated ""gold"" version), otherwise this would be 5 stars."
2,A marvelous book I stumbled upon . . . .,"Although a mild amount of confusion made WAS a little slow to get into, I soon found myself captivated by the story. Ryman has amazing ability to work many seemingly complicated elements into something so beautifully fluid. The characters were all so different; it was amazing to see how they could all share something as simple as The Wizard of Oz. The author's creativity entranced me throughout the stroy."
2,The One Year Devotions for Teens,Had been searching for a more mature devotional for my teens. The One Year Devotional for Teens by Susie Shellenberger was just what I was looking for. It's applicable to their ages and doesn't take but 5 minutes or so each evening to read through together. I highly recommend it to others who wish to have daily devotions with their teens.
2,No Problems,"Shipping was fine, Im SURE the cable is great but as it turns out i cant use it . . .BE SURE What YOU ACTUALLY NEED BEFORE ORDERING CABLES !!!"
2,Lucille Ball was a genius.,"I Love Lucy - The Sixth Season is the final season for the Ricardo's and the Mertz's. They move to the country halfway through the season to CT. All the seasons are great and funny. Lucille Ball was a comic genius, great timing, and timeless writing. My favorite episode is when the girls want to dance with their husbands and all they want to do is dance and mingle with a young attractive blonde played by a pre-I dream of Jeannie, Barbara Eden. This show ended at the right time, when they show was still on top. Buy, borrow or rent this season, I Love Lucy was the best show of the 1950s."
2,I still dig the Cap'n - Shiny Beast is excellent,"An excellent, excellent production from Cap'n and the boys.Right up there with Clear Spot.(I'm not so up on Trout Mask - too sludgy)Owed T'Alex has a slide guiter that lifted the top of my skull off. I retrieved it and put it back on, but my brain has been permanently dessicated.And Tropical Hot Dog Night - like two flamingos in a fruit fight - who gets to meet the monster tonight?Beefheart is a master. I have never heard anyone else who matches him. Take Bob Dylan, for example - his lyrics dont stand up that well - they are phoney. Take Patty Smith - Horses - it might have sounded good in the 70's, but now it is just embarassing.But Beefheart - still good. The man is the greatest electric poet ever.P.S. y'all: I have been trying to force people to appreciate the Cap'n since the mid 70's, no success to date.If you dig the Cap'n - you are a well-meaning misfit."
2,"Everworld ""Search for Senna""","Overall, this was a pretty good book. I love to read fiction stories, basically the ones that have to do with magic, etc... I gave this book a rating of 4. I couldn't give it a 5 because i still felt like there was something missing from it. It was very interesting to read, but I really don't like it when books just end...leave off, and make you wait to read the next, (It is a pretty long series). This book has a lot to deal with Dreams, and fantasy, yet combined into a sort of freaky reality. If you like fiction, or if you just like to read in general, I suggest this book. I'm not quite so sure about the whole series because I have not read the other books yet, but I'm sure they get better by the book. If you are interested in a book that will make you keep wanting to read more to find out what happens next, this is a good one. It close to being rated a 5. What a good book!"
2,Walking Dead Rocks!,"This must be the best thing on Television that I've seen in years. Love it! Gritty, Riveting, Tense. A must see show for anyone who loves to watch characters react to each other and the world around them."
2,Great Cult Entertainment,"A good B-movie/cult film always has certain elements that make it enjoyable. Kingdom of the Spiders even has a great B-movie title.Harkening back to the time when films like this were made at a fantastic rate, KOS is the cream of the crop. An actually quite intelligent movie that has good special effects for its time, this is very entertaining movie that doesn't cop out during its entire running time.While William Shatner is known for giving outrageous and campy performances, e.g. T.J. Hooker, The Wrath of Khan (Khan! KHAN!!!), he gives the ultimate B-movie performance. The supporting cast is less capable, but being the name, Shatner entertains like he is supposed to.The spiders are the real draw though, and they're actually quite well done, but nothing like the realistic spiders in a movie from today like Eight Legged Freaks.Overall, this is highly entertaining shlock that will be sure to give you enjoyment. Also, the ending is brilliant."
2,Great Product,"I love these bottles! Not only is clean up a breeze, but they are also quick and easy to fix. My daughter had acid reflux, so it was very important that she not get air in her stomach when she ate. The collapsable liners were the best solution to this problem. I also love that they are quick and easy to heat up, and you can feel the temperature of the milk through the liner.I only gave them four stars because by the time my daughter need the 8 ounce bottle she also need the fast flow nipple instead of the slow flow, so I had to buy separate nipples, but I consider this only a minor inconvenience."
2,A quick and somewhat interesting read.,I found this book a very quick easy read - and it kept my attention. There was a point where it was hard for me to put down near the end. Being new to road cycling this year (generally ride mountain - which I still prefer...) I found it an interesting view into what other riders may be thinking when dropping me on a climb. There is humor in the comments Krabbe makes and the manner in which he frames things.
2,"Good book, but not the best Saddle Club I've read","I liked the book. It would teach you alot about buying horses and what to look for in buying the right horse for yourself. In this book, Carole, Stevie, and Lisa have to find a home for Veronica DiAngelo's old horse, Garnet, when Veronica gets a new expensive Thoroughbred. Although, I should point out one thing, it said in the book the Danny, Veronica's new Thoroughbred states that his bloodlines trace back to Secretariat, and they say state in the book that Secretariat is a son of Man O' War. That is an incorrect fact. Secretariat was sired by Bold Ruler and Man O' War was long dead before Secretariat even came into the racing world. Other than that it was a good bok with alot of facts."
2,Multipurpose little locks,"I actually bought these locks to secure our chicken coop from people and predators. It was a great deal for 4 little locks that all work off the same key. I've had these locks outside for several months despite them not being made for outdoor use. They have rusted a bit and are harder to open and close, but are still functioning.So, if you need some light security on something, even if it isn't luggage, these may do the trick. It's nice that it comes with 4 keys, because then my wife and I can have a key, and we can also leave keys with neighbors to collect the eggs while we are gone.Unconventional use, I know, but these have done pretty well. As for using them for luggage? These would work great. They are small and light. If you have any questions, leave me a comment and let me know. Hope this was helpful!"
2,A fine thriller,"The Falls starts with a missing persons case of a young lady who may have gone on a quest related to an Internet quiz game. A little coffin appears at a small set of falls, only to be connected to other coffins that followed murders in the past. Is she simply gone or will she too turn up dead? Will Rebus finally sell his place and/or call it quits altogether? Rebus once again is ready to tick everyone off to get to the truth and ready to battle and befriend his ghosts and demons, as always. A fine thriller. Recommended."
2,Excellent Card Reader,"This Sony does it all. Its compact, accepts all the memory cards I currently own, and had a great price."
2,"Fits Perfect, Looks Great!","I have a Taurus Model 85, I purchased these grips with the intention of adding a more modern look to my revolver. The grips far exceeded my expectations, they vastly improved the comfort of the gun, I feel like I have more control of the gun than I did with the factory walnut grips. A review prior to me stated that the screw was too short, I didn't find this to be the case in my experience. Everything looked and worked perfectly."
2,"Raw, Absolute & Unapologetic!!",Listening to this CD shook the hidden Granada roots in me J. it is raw flamenco and an absolute pleasure for the well trained and well traveled listener.
2,The BEST of the best,"You will have no regrets buying this CD.Carrie is beautiful and her voice is amazing.Stand out songs are Wasted, Some Hearts and I ain't in Checotah Anymore.A perfect CD !"
2,Pink!!!-.-,The Igloo is Fantastic! But It Would Be Better If I could Have Chosen The Color :\ But Besides that The Igloo Truely Does satisfy Me(:*My 7 Newborn Rabbits LOVE it![:*
2,great controller,It was just like a normal controller but your fingers touch the battery pack. it takes a little getting use to but in in the end it is the best controller your money can buy. the wireless capabillities work just perfectly. buy this if you want a wireless controller that you can count on.
2,A very good place to begin,"To learn about the culture of manhood, a good place to begin is with a good, strong, well documented history. This is, indeed, a good place to begin. Positing male sociolization within a context that includes its affect on women and children and the family in general, Rotundo is able to place the history of work, virtue, romance and identity in a way that makes sense in terms of where we've been. Hopefully, this will give us a clear first step in terms of where we go from here. Any book that clarifies, from the very beginning, the difference between *gender* and *sex*, is a book that has a good chance of knowing what it is talking about."
2,good stand,this is a good stand i have a samson mic and shockmount eazy to connect and use !EXTENDS VERY HIGH ALMOST 7 FEET
2,Excellence and Variety,"I am only sorry that I did not start listening to Dead Can Dance years ago. If I had only one of their CD's, and I now have several, it would be this one. In addition to doing songs from earlier albums, they add several new ones as well. The balance between the work of Lisa Gerard and Brendan Perry is very good, and the songs on which they share duties are equally wonderful. I have seen the video that goes by the same name and it is nice to have the visual images without the interview sections. The other reviewers have done a great job of talking about the music, I will just add that I have close around 300 CD's and if I had only ten, this would be a keeper. I have even recorded it on my computer at work!"
2,Off the Beaten Path...,"Loved this movie. My real reason for this review is because I wanted to ask a question for anyone who knows. Does anyone know the brand of luggage the Asian guy is using. It's silver/chrome, box-shape, and cool looking! If you know the brand name of that luggage, you will be my favorite person in the world!!Ok, back to the movie; one has to have an open mind to have the patience to watch a film like this. It's rather slow, quirky, interesting! It also reminds me of my life-long goal of seeing the world! I tend to like movies that are off the beaten path!"
2,Simply terrific.,"This whole series is a showcase of talent. Good writing, good acting, and a wonderful relief from the usual stuff one sees on TV or in the movies. It's quirky and it's human. Not laugh out oud funny but always good in the best sense. Highly recommended."
2,Captivating,This book exhibits a strong gravitational force. Interesting on so many levels and orbits. Left with more intrigue than questions.
2,The trials of being a forensic anthropologist,"I recieved this book as a gift when I was in high school. I loved it then. Since I've recently finished a Masters in forensic anthropology myself, I decided to pull it off my shelf and give it another run through.This is hands down the most honest and truthful illustration of what it's like to work in this field in a market flooded with a glut of products dedicated to the likes of Patricia Cornwell and Kathy Reichs. Every Bones/CSI fan needs to read this book and learn about the un-glamorous parts of these careers. I went into my career as a forensic anthropologist with a realistic understanding of the job because of Dr. Maples' great prose. While the CSI wannabes whine about the maggots and the smell, I do my job.This is a great book for anyone who is interested in forensic science and should be a required read in introductory courses."
2,Awesome espionage and war battle scenes!,"If you like Buchan's 39 Steps, you'll enjoy Dick Haynay's next adventure. The first part of this story focuses on espionage throughout Scotland and beyond. I thought the story was wrapping up but it simply switched gears, going into overdrive as the reader is plunged into World War I, battling the Germans forces in France.I have thus far only read two of his works but I look forward to reading more of John Buchan!"
2,Good enough for now,"I see a lot of rave reviews and wonder what age the reviewers are. I think it makes a difference. I was tired of the commonly available makeup in stores that target older women. They are so heavy and pasty, and look terrible as the day wears on. Rather than minimize wrinkles and fine lines, they seem to accentuate it by settling in the creases.I switched from that regimen to this along with the Philosophy powder foundation. I've been using this for about 2 months now. The primer alone is fine for weekends, but I need the additional powder for work/more formal settings. I'm pretty happy with the results compared to the above. It wears well throughout the day as well; I don't cringe when I look in the mirror after a long day at work. However, if a product is going to call itself 'perfect', it sets the bar really high for reviews. I do plan on trying some other products after I use up my current supply, so the jury is still out on this one."
2,new favorite toy,"i have a sheltie--super smart and high energy. whenever i bring this toy out, he gets SO excited. he'll do any command i want just to play with it. i don't keep it in his toy bin with all the other toys for him to access throughout the day while i'm at work because he'll chew it up in no time. i only let him play with it when i'm there to watch him. long story short, he LOVES this toy; best one i've bought so far. the balls do squeak, so don't bring it out if you're trying to take a nap :)"
2,Classical Mechanics/John Taylor Physics Textbook Review,"Thanks a lot!This textbook by Taylor is a great studying manual for Classical Mechanics, a very essential textbook for any aspiring physics major.The book arrived new and perfect, like said.It was shipped very quickly also.Once again, thank you for your perfection.We should never settle for anything less.;)Kevin."
2,"CD is for everyone, will make you happy","Believe me, you don't have to like opera music to love this CD. It is good for everyone, especially if you need some happy days in your life. His ""Va, pensiero,"" and ""Is Nothing Sacred,"" are incredible. The beautiful ""You Are So Beautiful"" is reason enough to buy this CD. But it is the classical music that I enjoy the most - ""Ave Maria,"" ""Volare"", ""Che gelida manina,"" and ""Mattinata"", to name a few.His duets that he performs with Lulu and Richie are exquisite and his final ""Where My Heart Will Take Me"" will lift your spirits upThis is my second Russell Watson CD, and I am thoroughly delighted! No regrets whatsoever, in fact, consider myself so lucky to have discovered Watson."
2,"Modern, but not dissonant",Catch this album if you are interested in modern classical music! Each one of the pieces has a unique lyrical beauty all its own. Each is impeccably played by this fine ensemble.
2,Husky rear seat liner,"Because my kids play baseball and soccer, they were always leaving mud and dirt on the floor of my wife's vehicle. I decided to purchase this Husky liner and have not been disappointed. It's very sturdy and is cupped around the edges just in case something spills."
2,Pleased,"Once you figure how to position them on the car to reduce noise, they work great! Easy to install. I'm pleased."
2,BBS Rocks!!!,"First came across these guys with their ""Little Piece of Dixie"" CD which is great. So I thought I'd check this one out too and it didn't dissapoint. It's Southern Rock at it's best. Check 'em out live if you get the chance, you won't regret it."
2,Ladder Cover,What is there to say? It is a heavy duty foam end cover for the ladder. The one on the ladder is hard but works well but since I use it as a step ladder most of the time this is nice to put on when using it as an extension ladder.
2,"Review for ""In the Forests of the Night""","I thought this book was amazing! I've always been fascinated my vampires and such folklore, and this book has made me want to learn as much as I can! I also found it very inspirational, because I am a 14-year-old aspiring author, and just the fact that someone my age can finally receive recognition and respect as a writer gives me the courage to go after my dream! Keep it up, Amelia! I can't wait to read your future work."
2,Pretty and sophisticated poster,"I purchased the unframed version of this poster. The colors are not quite as vibrant as in the picture, but I wouldn't call them ""washed-out"". The lights actually look more yellow/orange than I was expecting, since I was going for a dark, bluish picture. The poster still looks very pretty, and from across the room in a simple black frame it looks much more expensive than it was."
2,Excellent Product,"Although I replaced an antennae on my roof (so I was up on a ladder) installing this product was simple. I recommend assembling as much as possible on the ground and then take the antennae on the roof, bringing tools afterwards. Older antennaes are difficult to remove if they've been up for a while.I installed the new antennae because I also installed an HD converter box for an older TV and the HD signals were dropping or pixelating. This antennae solved the problem immediately, bringing in all available broadcast channels. I occasionally have an issue but usually it is minor. The signals are now stronger and I'm sure this new antennae solved the problems."
2,Perfect,This was for a small touch lamp that someone gave my daughter. It fit perfect and looks perfect. Great size too!
2,Great starter chess set,"I purchased this because of the reviews that vouched for easing in the beginnings, especially kids. The chess board is two sided: one side has stationary positioning labels and movement rules for the pieces. The other side is the standard chess board. The chess pieces are your typical plastic (strong but hallow). The cards included for ""thinkless"" play are good starters.Overall, a great value. It's already a full chess set, plus extras for beginners/kids. All cheaper than chess sets of the same quality."
2,Pretty amazing for $50,"This is a ""first look"" review. I just bought the Eureka at Lowe's for $47.97. It goes together very easily with just a Phillips head screwdriver. The machine is relatively quiet and has great suction. I vacuumed an area that I had just cleaned with my old vacuum, and the Eureka picked up quite a bit that the old machine missed.When cleaning tile and wood floors, the suction was so powerful that dustballs a foot away started moving. I haven't experienced the hose popping out of the base or any of the issues reported by other reviewers, but I've only been using it for a half hour. If my very favorable impression changes over the coming months, I'll be sure to update the review."
2,Highly recomended,"My dog love it, and She's a very, very picky eater- even with treats. So, this product must have a great flavor."
2,"Eye-opening, high concept fiction","Bill Myer's ELI made me reconsider some of my own preconceptions of Jesus Christ and his earthly ministry. I think we often keep the historical Jesus at a safe distance, therefore it was mind-boggling to think of him entering a pornographer's house, approaching a skinhead's camp, and calling a motley crew of disciples! Bill Myers deserves many enthusiastic kudos for daring to bring the Gospel into the twenty-first century. This book is wonderful!"
2,CHICAGO: THE MOVIE DVD,"WE RECEIVED THIS QUICKLY AND IT IS IN GOOD ORDER AS WE CAN SEE.GOOD PRICEdrama, ,musical theatre AT IT'S BEST!!!Richard Gere, Renee Zellweger,Catherine Zeta-Jones,AND QUEEN LATIVA ARE AT THEIR BEST!!!QUALITY DANCE AND SINGING. THE BAND IS FABULOUS. I COULD LISTEN AND WATCH ALL NIGHT. WIDESCREED EDITION REALLY GIVES A MUCH BETTER VIEW OF THE WHOLE STAGE AND SOME OF THAT IS SPECTACULAR!!!! THIS IS AN UPBEAT VERSION OF THE MUSICALS OF THE 30'S AND 40'S GREAT COMEDY BUT NOT SLAPSTIC. WE HAVE WATCHED THIS SEVERAL TIMES AND STILL ENJOY IT!!!"
2,Have read all of Rhodes Books,Disappointed that I could not lend this kindle book. Why Not allow the lending of the book? If I had bought the paper copy I could have allowed friends to read it.
2,"Mr. Darcy, move over!","If you're a fan of Pride and Prejudice, this movie is for you. It's a movie, once again, in which the main characters misunderstand each other. Our hero in this movie is much, much darker and has a more fiery temper than Mr. Darcy. Our heroine, while not quite as appealing as Elizabeth Bennett, does grow on you as the film progresses. If you like the 6-hour A&E production of Pride and Prejudice, this will definitely do the trick."
2,Digimon World,"This game is very good. You explore vast inviroments of volcanos, icy worlds, forests, mountains, and more- all with a digimon that can digivole and battle to higher forms. the only thing is, if you make a mistake- you'll get a numemon, or if the digimon's stats aren't good enough, you'll get a numemon. and no matter what level your digimon is- when his virus meter is full, it will turn into a sukamon. of course, you can mostly avoid these terrors. but the neat graphics makes it fun. =)"
2,GREAT SHARK MOVIE...,THIS IS THE BEST SHARK MOVIE SINCE JAWS THE WAY THE DIRECTOR USES FOOTAGE OF THE GREAT WHITE SHARK IS FANTASTIC VERY REALISTIC NOT LIKE ALOT OF THE CGI THAT IS USED IN MOVIES THESE DAYS THIS IS A MUST BUY FOR ANYONE INTO THESE KIND OF MOVIES YOU WONT BE DISAPPOINTED ALSO DONT COMPARE THIS TO OPEN WATER AS THIS IS WAY BETTER AND IS ALOT MORE EXCITING ..... ENJOY!!!
2,trip to a foreign land,"That's what reading Sara Backer's American Fuji is like. I learned things about Japan I never otherwise would have--except by doing as the author did and living there for a while. But American Fuji is much more than a travelogue. Equal parts mystery, woman's quest, and poignant exploration of living with chronic illness, the book will touch you on many levels. The fact that it's also funny turns it into one of the most unusual novels I've read this year."
2,Great gift!,"I bought this for my mom for Christmas and she absolutely loved it! It came in a really cute collectible box, also, which I didn't expect! The shipping was a little slower than expected, but I was overall very satisfied with my purchase!"
2,amazing,"this is an amazing film. very inspirational, and thought-provoking. it causes one to rethink their life and to aspire to be something more, to have a closer relationship with God. definitely recommend it. it is a must-have in every Christian household"
2,I play it everyday!,"This is an amazing album. I am a big fan of the Idols and have purchased all of their albums. But I must say Kurt's album ""I"" is far superior to them all. Every song is a gem; especially, Smell the Roses, Last Day of Summer and his covers of Ordinary World and She's so High are the best I've ever heard. I can't wait for the rest of America to catch on to him, he will be a big star!"
2,this is a good book,I love sci-fi and this is at the topp of my list. it is not ment for little kids but is still readable if they are good readers.
2,The First and Best Relationship and Communication Book You Should Read,The most essential skill to success is mastering the art of relationships. This classic book shows you how to create genuine relationships with people so that you may take power and responsibility of your life. Anyone who wants to succeed with people must master the strategies and techniques within this book.This is the first book of its kind. It's wise to learn from the original source that everyone else is just rewriting and regurgitating.
2,Great Sound - Great Price,"Purchased this for recording while doing sermons. The sound quality is outstanding and the long cable is good if you need to place it remotely. However, I am using a Digital Voice Recorder on my person so the long cord is annoying. I contacted Audio-Technica via email and they told me how to shorten the cord (you will need to know how to solder and some basic audio wiring concepts). To do this you will need to get the mono replacement plug at Radio Shack, small wire cutters and strippers, and have a small soldering iron with rosin core solder. I cannot overstress the clarity of the sound quality; without a doubt it surpasses anything close to this price!"
2,cool Castle!! a must have for any tank,This is a fun castle!! not overpriced at all seeing how big it is .. its huge. perfect for a 55 gallon tank or larger.fishes love to swim through it.makes a great hiding place too..A must have..
2,"Excellent DD 5.1 audio, especially with a subwoofer!","Wow, the sound blew me away! I could feel the jet engines rumbling. Ok ok, I know that you can't hear engines rumble in space, I liked it anyway. The voices are very clear and understandable. There is only one audio track though, no DTS or stereo track.The video was not nearly as good. As other reviewers have reported, there are some problems. I would still call it above average for a TV show. The video quality was better than my cable signal. It's in widescreen, of course (1:78:1). Although the extras aren't as good as the previous seasons of B5, they are still much better than many other TV shows. There's an easter egg, like the previous seasons.It's hard to stop watching. The episodes flow into each other and the tension increases throughout the season. There are several references to prior seasons. I don't recommend this DVD if you haven't seen the first three seasons, you won't get the full effect. Excellent DVD set."
2,Love it,My kids and I have been totally fascinated by the ANTW2 Antworks Illuminated. It is such a great improvement over the ant farms of years past. The light enables us to watch it at night. Friends of all ages have been attracted to this ant farm.We've enjoyed ours so much we gave several as Christmas gifts to others.
2,Great Cargo Liner!,"Husky Liners Custom Fit Molded Rear Cargo Liner (Grey)This is a great Cargo Liner for the price. Fits like a glove in the back of my 2012 Ford Escape XLT. I use it in my work truck, and I am constantly throwing plants, tools, etc. in the back. Very durable.I do wish they made a liner that would cover the entire back when the seats are layed flat..."
2,Turned out to be the best gift ever!,This was a gift for my niece who is teaching English as a second language to foreign students. She was so thrilled when she opened it and proceeded to read some of it out loud to all her family. Had no idea it was so difficult to learn English. Just happy she's happy.
2,Great,"I enjoyed listening to this album. The only flaw is the song ""People"" from Funny Girl. It is set to a very cheesy unballady rhythm sung by a person that sounds like she's coughing up a hairball. Still, this is a Broadway CD anyone will enjoy."
2,Great for cast iron maintenance,I bought this brush to apply oil to my cast iron skillet. Works great.It is easy to clean with soap and hot water from my sink's sprayer.
2,Excellent product,I bought this book because I had heard it was a great reference. It has proven to be a useful addition to my adventures.
2,Great!,I've been using Mother's Milk Tea since the birth of our son 14 month ago...and it a wonderful product! I include a box in all my newborn gift baskets! Highly recommended!
2,These are what all the kids are asking for,"In the sense that these are what my son wanted, they fit the bill. It took him a couple of days flailing about but after he got the hang of them, they are pretty cool. I can't imaging them being comfortable if I just wanted to walk. Sketchers has a competitive product that the wheels can be retracted that I would choose if I were wearing them. These wheels have a tool that must be carried with if you want to remove the wheels. They are well made and have high quality materials."
2,NC REPRESENT!,"i've only heard a few songs from LB, but i can normally tell if people are good by listening to a few of their songs. and not only are they good, but they are from Raliegh (i'm from Fayetteville), so NC up in this, big tyme!"
2,Flawed DVD with essential film clips,"For Your Love - From Yardbirds to Zeppelin - is a flawed DVD of very good performances. Many of these clips are unnecessarily tinted blue. One video does not match the soundtrack. However, with all those problems, this (so far) is the best resource for these essential bits of Yardbirds (and early Led Zeppelin) history. You do, in fact, witness the very BIRTH of Led Zeppelin in the concert footage on the last four selections of this DVD. Even better than that, it gives us a wonderful original Yardbirds version of ""Dazed and Confused"" (in a live performance) with Relf on vocals.So as far as I know (as of 2011) this DVD is the best available for this material. I certainly hope that this material will be given a cleaner and better-documented rendering at some point in the future. The Yardbirds certainly deserve better than this DVD but, as flawed as it is, I am very glad to have these performances."
2,Great wrap up,A great end to a great series. My son has greatly enjoyed watching these AFTER he reads the books. The ability to see it brought to life has been sweet.
2,Smells like Nirvana,"Weird Al is the King of Parody. I haven't had a CD of his that hasn't made me laugh over and over again. Cannot say much to add to the bulk of this testimonial, but if you have enjoyed his work this is one of Weird Al's best CDs of contemporary music."
2,concise description of spiritual world,"I thoroughly enjoyed this easy, yet deep read. The author revealed through his daughter a clear & profound description of what he found upon his death on the Titanic. I recommend this book as entry level read to learn more about the spiritual realm."
2,Emotional Ride,One thing that makes me consider a movie to be good is the extent to which it makes me feel. This movie ranks among some of my favorite movies because of the range and depth of feelings it was able to produce. If only I could maintain a feeling of love and acceptance of everyone and everything like Colin Farrell's character seemed to portray in my everyday life.
2,"Be-all, end-all on Ketogenic Dieting",Lyle has encapsulated the many aspects of the ketogenic dieting world into one glorious compendium. A must-read for people in search of the how's and why's behind the world's most effective fat-loss diets. Congratulations Lyle!
2,The Innocent Man,"John Grisham is the man. ALways love reading his books, and having it available on the Kindle is so easy."
2,"Weird, Wacky, and Fun: Not to be read to a class at school","The bizarre antics of Andy, the narrator, had me laughing and shaking my head. I love weird stories by authors with off-beat senses of humour, and this book fits the bill. My favorite story of them all is the one where he invents an invisible friend to help him get out of field day, but his mom turns the tables on him by treating the best friend even better than she treats Andy.I'm an elementary school teacher, and WOULDN'T READ this to my class due to some of the situations presented. The most disturbing story was the one where Andy dressed up as a girl and went to a dance, where one of the boys tried to pick himi up. However, I will read it to my children at home because I know there won't be any complaints. It's a perfect book to pick up when you have 10-15 minutes to spend reading because you can easily finish each short story within that time."
